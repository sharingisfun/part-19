The authors have maintained a superb balance between structure and function and continue to emphasize the correlations between normal physiology and pathophysiology, normal anatomy and pathology, and homeostasis and homeostatic imbalances. No other text and package offers a teaching and learning environment as rich and complete.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d74368082f1a564bfb5bc7b1d00eb32515dbeb","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Anatomy+and+Physiology%2C+14th+Ed+-+Tortora","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d74368082f1a564bfb5bc7b1d00eb32515dbeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,215,67,104,8,47,26,86,75,251,91,199,177,208,14,179,37,21,219,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
