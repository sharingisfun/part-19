Harrison grew up in working-class Leeds and, since exploding into public consciousness in 1987 when his controversial poem 'V' was televised, he has been well-known for his outspoken politics, with his poetry dealing with issues of class, race and power. Throughout his prolific career, he has written for the theatre, opera, film, television and print - but all of it in verse.\r\n\r\nHarrison has inspired a generation of younger writers to find their own voice - including fellow Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage, who like Harrison has established himself in other fields such as TV and translation, and whose northern roots and ear for the language of the street has given his work a young, urban appeal.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 21 (~1428Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~105Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 659 MB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71b44ce5db62e9ea7d4b7216f6c652e17bff4bb","amp;dn":"Simon.Armitage.in.Conversation.with.Tony.Harrison.720p.HDTV.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71b44ce5db62e9ea7d4b7216f6c652e17bff4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,27,68,206,93,182,46,158,167,212,183,33,111,108,101,46,23,191,244,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
