After pleading guilty to a series of       :\n : homicides, he sits on death row, awaiting lethal injection. And writing his:\n : life story.

And, as too many have:\n : learned, when it comes to protecting his baby brother, Esau Till is a man  :\n : without boundaries.                                                        :\n :                                                                            :\n : EsauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father was a widely feared beast who, it was commonly believed,     :\n : killed his wife and used his own daughter as a substitute.

His brother Tory drew a Ã¢â‚¬Å“slowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mind but almost superhuman   :\n : strength. Very early on, Esau learned that the only way to guarantee his   :\n : baby brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safety was to make himself indispensable to certain people. :\n : A self-taught explosives expert, he became the top assassin for two rival  :\n : local mobs. When a third mob attempted to recruit his brother, Esau took   :\n : them all out, unaware that one of them was an under-cover FBI agent.       :\n :                                                                            :\n : Execution looms, but no prison can hold EsauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind.
