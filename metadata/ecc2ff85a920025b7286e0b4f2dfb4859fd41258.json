Rogers and his collaborators tell the story of one of the most influential buildings of the 20th century - the Pompidou Centre in Paris - the result of a contest he didn't want to enter and no-one ever thought they would win. Other early projects featured include Norman Foster's glassy Willis Faber &amp; Dumas Headquarters in Ipswich, Farrell &amp; Grimshaw's corrugated aluminium tower block next to Regent's Park in London and the industrial-style Hopkins House in Hampstead\n\n2)  Power of the Past \nThis episode focuses on the 1980s, when modern architecture was deeply unpopular and under attack from the Prince of Wales. The architects reveal the dramatic stories behind some of their most famous creations, including Rogers's Lloyd's of London building and Foster's Stansted Airport. Terry Farrell reveals how he was kept in the dark when he was designing the MI6 Headquarters; Michael Hopkins recalls the challenges of bringing ultra-modern architecture into the traditional world of Lord's Cricket Ground; and Nicholas Grimshaw follows in the footsteps of the great Victorian engineers with his Waterloo International station.\n\n3)  Politics of Power \nThe final episode focuses on the period from the late 90s to the present day, when they were at the peak of their success - building iconic landmarks across Britain and the world - but also faced some of the biggest controversies of their careers. Rogers reveals what went wrong with the Millennium Dome, Foster recalls the wobbles of London's Millennium Bridge and Michael Hopkins explains how his new parliamentary building, Portcullis House, became the most expensive office block in Britain. Also featured are the stories behind some of Britain's most popular modern architecture - Nicholas Grimshaw's Eden Project and Foster's 'Gherkin' - and a look at this generation's success overseas, including Terry Farrell's success in China.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/4883/dv8h.jpg&quot;
