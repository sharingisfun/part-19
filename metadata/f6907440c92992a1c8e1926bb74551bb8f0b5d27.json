I have just discovered that the rip of the first film was missing a copy of the third DVD (ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a 3.5 hour film). The best thing to do would be to kill the torrent and repackage, but it already has 150 leechers at over 50%. I will re-release this with the missing section shortly, but for now please go to http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4661322/An.Evening.With.Kevin.Smith.2002.DVDRip.XviD-RETRO and grab the third .AVI to complete this collection. I apologize for not doublechecking everything before uploading.\n\n\n\nKevin Smith - All Three Interviews Films (Evening, Evening Harder, Sold Out)\n\n\nWhat This Torrent IS ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I have found, downloaded, tidied up, and repackaged all three Kevin Smith college interview films into one seamless torrent. I have eliminated the .rar files and some of the fluff. The original loaders even have the films separated into different torrents (Such as KS part 1 and KS part 2), all with low seed rates and uneven distribution.\n\nWhat This Torrent ISNÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Original work. I have taken the fine rips of other folks and make no claim to have ripped these myself. I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t create the subtitles or the NFO files. Most credit belongs to LODER on TPB, who always does excellent work, even if his packaging isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t user friendly.\n\nWhy Bother? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ After watching the third film, I felt a yearning to rewatch the other two, and had some trouble both finding and downloading them. My hope is that enough people will seed the trilogy in this format that it stays easily available for a long time.\n\nKeep The Following In Mind ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ These are standard (I assume AutoGK) Xvid .AVI rips of the original DVDs. They play fine on both VLC and on WMP. Some subtitles are provided by the original uploaders, and are part of the package. *I* did not rip these, and I therefore donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to hear a single comment about the quality, which is just fine, thank you very much.\n\n\nAn Evening with Kevin Smith - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346952/\n\nAn Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910873/\n\nKevin Smith: Sold Out - A Threevening with Kevin Smith - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1083858/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6907440c92992a1c8e1926bb74551bb8f0b5d27","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+-+All+Three+Interviews+Films+%28Evening%2C+Evening+Harde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6907440c92992a1c8e1926bb74551bb8f0b5d27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,144,116,64,201,41,146,161,200,225,146,107,183,69,81,187,143,11,93,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
