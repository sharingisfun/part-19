For nearly 70 years, generations would grow up on bases with special schools, shops, housing and even their own radio station, as parts of the Rhineland became little bubbles of Britishness.\n\nFeaturing a nostalgic soundtrack of German language versions of period pop hits and contributions from military historians such as Max Hastings and former BBC sports commentator Barry Davies - himself a former British Army of the Rhine soldier - as well as those of military wives and children.\n\nOnce the frontline in the Cold War, the BAOR is now being called home as the Ministry of Defence begins preparations to finally pull British forces out.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fab2939d92bab6c9d4cb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 22\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: HE-AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 613 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: PDTV\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d27b9384abebd6ea82a8d2377ae90fbf5b785b1d","amp;dn":"BBC+Timeshift+2012+The+British+Army+of+the+Rhine+PDTV+x264+AAC+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d27b9384abebd6ea82a8d2377ae90fbf5b785b1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,123,147,132,171,235,214,234,130,168,210,55,122,233,15,191,91,120,91,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
