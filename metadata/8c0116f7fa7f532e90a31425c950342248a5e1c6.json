Le Guin - Orsinian Tales (Bantam, 1975). 209 pages.\n\nA collection of short stories that takes place in the same setting as Le Guin's Malafrena, available here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8078134/Ursula_K._Le_Guin_-_Malafrena_(pdf)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8078134/Ursula_K._Le_Guin_-_Malafrena_(pdf)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote: This is historical fiction, not fantasy or science fiction.\n\nOrsinia ... a land of medieval forests, stonewalled cities, and railways reaching into the mountains where the old gods dwell. A country where life is harsh, dreams are gentle, and people feel torn by powerful forces and fight to remain whole. In this enchanting collection, Ursula K. Le Guin brings to mainstream fiction the same compelling mastery of word and deed, of story and character, of violence and love, that has won her the Pushcart Prize, and the Kafka and National Book Awards.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin is the author of more than one hundred short stories, two collections of essays, four volumes of poetry, and nineteen novels. Her best-known fantasy works, the Earthsea books, have sold millions of copies in America and England, and have been translated into sixteen languages. Her first major work of science fiction, The Left Hand of Darkness, is considered epochmaking in the field because of its radical investigation of gender roles and its moral and literary complexity.\n\nThree of Le Guin's books have been finalists for the American Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, and among the many honors her writing has received are the National Book Award, five Hugo Awards, five Nebula Awards, the Kafka Prize, a Pushcart Prize, and the Harold D. Vursell Award of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. She lives in Portland, Oregon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c0116f7fa7f532e90a31425c950342248a5e1c6","amp;dn":"Ursula+K.+Le+Guin+-+Orsinian+Tales+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c0116f7fa7f532e90a31425c950342248a5e1c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,1,22,247,250,127,83,46,144,163,20,37,201,80,52,34,72,165,225,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
