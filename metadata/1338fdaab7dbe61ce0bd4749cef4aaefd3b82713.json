After all, outside there are 8-inch-high curbs and there's always the horrible chance he might see a gas station attendant wearing a blue hat. So, except for the occasional trip to the Rite Aid to admire the California girl Zandy and to buy earplugs because they're on sale, he stays home a lot. And good thing too, or he would have never been falsely implicated in a murder, never almost seduced by Philipa, never done the impossible task of jogging around the block with Brian, never ironed his pillows, and might never have won the Most Average American essay contest.\nIn The Pleasure of My Company, Steve Martin's second novel, all of the enjoyments of the critically acclaimed best seller Shopgirl are present: the tender portrayal of loneliness and love; a character's quest to reach out and engage the world; as well as laugh-out-loud humor and language that is brilliantly inventive. But in the story of Daniel Pecan Cambridge and the people who inhabit the insular universe he is seeking to expand (if only one small square at a time) Steve Martin has achieved something extraordinary: the chronicle of a modern-day neurotic yearning to break free.\n\nWhat the Critics Say:\n&quot;This novella is a delight....A complex mix of wit, poignancy, and Martin's clear, great affection for his characters.&quot; (Publishers Weekly)\n&quot;A genuinely funny and surprisingly touching tale. As compassionate as it is funny.&quot; (Kirkus Reviews)\n\nNarrator: Steve Martin\nFormat: mp3\nBitrate: 128 kb/s\nLength: about 5 h\nSize: about 230 mb in 4 parts\nPublisher: Hyperion AudioBooks\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHuge selection of audiobooks available at the blog.\n\nIf you visit please take the time to click on a few ads.
