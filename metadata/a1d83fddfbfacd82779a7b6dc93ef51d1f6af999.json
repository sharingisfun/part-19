The group is best known for its 1992 hit single &quot;Jump Around&quot;, which reached #3 in the United States, #6 in Ireland and #8 in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nAfter a brief unsuccessful solo career, Everlast teamed up with DJ Lethal and high school friend Danny Boy to form House of Pain (a name taken in from H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau). The group was signed to Tommy Boy Records, and their eponymous debut album (1992) went multi-platinum, spawning the successful DJ Muggs produced single &quot;Jump Around&quot;. This song was also remixed twice by Pete Rock, one version featuring a verse from him and one without. The album also featured Cypress Hill member, B-Real, on the song &quot;Put Your Head Out&quot;.\n\nFashioning themselves as rowdy Irish-American hooligans (Lethal is actually of Latvian heritage), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the influential 1993 rock-rap collaborative Judgment Night movie soundtrack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse of Pain 1992\n\n\n\nHouse of Pain is the debut album from House of Pain, released in 1992.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.
