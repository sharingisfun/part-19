Spartacus having met Lucius a Roman disillusioned with Rome because of the civil war Sulla waged years ago, gives shelter and information to the Rebels, mainly that the rumors that abound are that Spartacus and the Rebels are finished and all but slaughtered. Spartacus unwilling to forsake Crixus and send a message to the Romans, hatches a daring plan of rescue, where they will take the arena in Capua. Gannicus returns to Capua to give Oenomaus a honorable death in the arena, but unaware Oenomaus knows the truth of Gannicus' affair with Melitta. Lucretia dissuades Ilithyia from aborting her child, though Ilithyia must be rid of the pregnancy if she will marry Varinius. Lucretia through Ashur reveals the abortion attempt to Glaber. Ilithyia admits upon confrontation that their love and marriage is over. When the primus fight starts Oenomaus viciously attacks Gannicus and Mira is set to purpose of bringing down the arena by fire. When the arena collapses Spartacus and Agron attacks the remaining gladiators and guards and escape with Gannicus, Crixus and Oenomaus, but not before Spartacus throws a spear directly at Glaber and nicks his cheek. Glaber the last to leave the pulvenus comes upon Albinius (Ilithyia's father) trapped beneath a fallen beam, but he does not save his father-inlaw, but repeatedly crushes his skull. Glaber finds Ilithyia and tells her her father is dead and that they will remain married.
