Cliff â€™s adventures take him through a whirlwind affair with a former student from his high schoolâ€“teacher days twenty-some years before, to a â€œsnake farmâ€ in Arizona owned by an old classmate; and to the highoctane existence of his son, a big-time movie producer who has just bought an apartment over the Presidio in San Francisco. \r\n\r\nThe English Major is the map of a manâ€™s journey intoâ€”and out ofâ€”himself, and it is vintage Harrisonâ€”reflective, big-picture American, and replete with wicked wit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d80f223659fcc55ea5e5bdb0ac9fc0de5524b10","amp;dn":"The+English+Major_+A+Novel+-+Jim+Harrison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d80f223659fcc55ea5e5bdb0ac9fc0de5524b10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,128,242,35,101,159,204,85,234,94,91,219,10,201,252,13,229,82,75,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
