SeaTools for DOS can test Seagate or Maxtor Parallel ATA (PATA and IDE) and Serial ATA (SATA) interface disc drives. Because the software boots to its own operating system you can test your drive regardless of the OS installed on it.  You can even test a new or completely blank drive.  SeaTools for DOS will instruct the drive to run its built in Drive Self Test (DST) and give either a pass or fail status.  If you are troubleshooting your disc drive and the DST passes, then you have a good drive!\n\n\n\nLeave Comments THX :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be825b3215f13dc4b2bda3a008b35ccdc060d228","amp;dn":"SEAGATE+SEA+TOOLS+BOOTABLE+DISK+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be825b3215f13dc4b2bda3a008b35ccdc060d228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,130,91,50,21,241,61,196,178,189,163,160,8,179,92,205,192,96,210,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
