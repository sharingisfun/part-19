Von Neumann showed that the brain operates both digitally and analogically, but also has its own unique statistical language. And more than fifty years after its inception the &quot;von Neumann architecture&quot; - an organizational framework for computer design - still lies at the heart of today's machines. In his foreword to this new edition, Ray Kurzweil, a futurist famous for his own musings on the relationship between technology and consciousness, places von Neumann's work in a historical context and shows how it remains relevant today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b16143414bff627d62d32e59e1b564c800c6ef4","amp;dn":"The+Computer+and+the+Brain+3rd+ed+%282012%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b16143414bff627d62d32e59e1b564c800c6ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,22,20,52,20,191,246,39,214,45,50,229,158,27,86,76,128,12,110,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
