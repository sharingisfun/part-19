Cheesy goodness! Plus you get Zorak, Moltar and Brak!\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060026/\n\nhttp://www.tv.com/space-ghost-and-dino-boy/show/4922/episode_listings.html&amp;season=0\n\nThe episodes listed on tv.com after episode 42 are Dino Boy. This is the full series.\n\nEncoding is XviD with 128 bit mp3 sound (approximately 25mb per 6 minute episode). The rip is from DVD, but the original print isn't that great.\n\nAbout four hours total video, so pull a bong hit and enjoy. :)\n\nAnd of course, be cool, help seed the file for a while after you finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9d63f9b7fbbd13b56a038d1744e705f65e04cf7","amp;dn":"Space+Ghost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9d63f9b7fbbd13b56a038d1744e705f65e04cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,214,63,155,127,187,209,59,86,160,56,209,116,78,112,95,101,224,76,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
