Mrs. Goosen \n\nMitchell Goosen (McDermott) is a teenager from California who loves to surf and rollerblade. His zoologist parents are given the opportunity for grant work in Australia for 6 months. Eager to accompany his parents to the surf-friendly shores of the South Pacific, he is dismayed to find out that he will not be joining them and instead will be living with his aunt and uncle in Cincinnati, Ohio so as to finish the remainder of his high school semester. He arrives in the midst of a winter storm to a blue-collar Midwest city, quickly coming to the realization that this is far from the free spirited beach atmosphere that he has been accustomed to. To add to his disillusion he meets his cousin Wiley, (Green) who at first glance is an awkward teenager and whose parents' lifestyle and demeanor though warm and hospitable is a bit old-fashioned.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.
