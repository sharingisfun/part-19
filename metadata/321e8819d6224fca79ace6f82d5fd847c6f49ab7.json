He appeared to be an average family man, but then in 1970, he murdered his pregnant wife and three children, with no apparent motive. He electrocuted them then sent them over a cliff in the family car. Unbeknownst to Elmer, the car hit a small ledge and hung on above the crashing waves. It endured the stormy night hanging on the cliff edge with only a few centimetres of limestone stopping it from falling into the sea, and it was discovered the next morning by 2 tourists. A Coronial inquest was held in 1971, which found Elmer responsible for the deaths of his family. Despite numerous reported sightings over the past three decades, Elmer has never been caught. Psychics Deb Webber and Barbara Neilson re-investigate the crime and trace his movements since.\n\nSe om det finns nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥got mer jag har lagt upp:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/carma4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/carma4&lt;/a&gt;\n\n/carma4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:321e8819d6224fca79ace6f82d5fd847c6f49ab7","amp;dn":"Sensing.Murder.S01E06.Almost.Perfect.SWESUB.avi-carma4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"321e8819d6224fca79ace6f82d5fd847c6f49ab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,30,136,25,214,34,79,202,121,172,230,248,45,95,216,71,198,244,154,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
