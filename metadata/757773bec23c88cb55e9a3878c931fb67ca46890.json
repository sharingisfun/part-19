All can be freely downloaded from the BBC website, but this is a more convenient download if you just want an awesome collection.\n\nMost of the files are either the 23 minute documentary format, or the little 8 minute &quot;Witness&quot; historical mini-docs. There are a few other random files from other programs such as From Our Own Correspondent, and Outlook that I thought were particularly interesting.\n\nEverything is mp3 format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:757773bec23c88cb55e9a3878c931fb67ca46890","amp;dn":"BBC+World+Service+Radio+Documentary+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"757773bec23c88cb55e9a3878c931fb67ca46890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,119,115,190,194,60,136,203,85,233,163,135,140,147,31,182,124,164,104,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
