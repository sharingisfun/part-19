While escaping war-torn China, a group of travelers crash in the Himalayas, where they are rescued and taken to the mysterious Valley of the Blue Moon, Shangri-La. Hidden from the rest of the world, Shangri-La is a haven of peace and tranquility for world-weary diplomat Richard Conway. His ambitious brother, George, sees it as a prison from which he must escape, even if it means risking his life and bringing destruction to the ancient culture of Shangri-La.\n\n\n\nSpoken Language: English (No Subtitles)\nResolution: 720 x 400 (16:9 Widescreen)\nVideo Codec: MPEG-4\nFrame Rate: 29.97 Fps\nBit Rate: 820 Kbps\nContainer: AVI\nAudio: Mp3, 2 ch. 48000 Hz 128 Kbps\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/lost-horizon-original-soundtrack-mw0000026926&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/lost-horizon-original-soundtrack-mw0000026926&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Horizon_(1973_film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Horizon_(1973_film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb83b7ec287476128e41ce5cca3ef4f92b07971e","amp;dn":"Lost+Horizon+%281973%29+Musical+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb83b7ec287476128e41ce5cca3ef4f92b07971e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,131,183,236,40,116,118,18,142,65,206,92,202,62,244,249,43,7,151,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
