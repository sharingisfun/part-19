Long divorced but still a team, they need a new project and meet playwright Stanley Krown, who has written one in which the lead roles are a mother and a 19-year-old daughter.\n\nBeatrice wants to play the daughter. She can't pass for 19 but believes she can for 29, so wants the play rewritten. She also displays a romantic interest in Stanley.\n\nA young actress first calling herself Sally Carver and then Peggy Pruitt wants an audition. Stanley has her do some typing on his rewrite, and a jealous Beatrice finds her an acting job out of town. Stanley's play previews in Washington, D.C., and flops. Sally, now calling herself Claudia Souvain, tries to persuade Stanley that the actress is too old for the role.\n\nSeeing the play in a small town with Sally in the lead, now under her real name of Clara Mootz, convinces Stanley that she is right. Beatrice finally concedes that it's time for her to act her age. She agrees to take the mother's part, and on Broadway the play is a huge success.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 846 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.212:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 93 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91e17affe2f6ba25f4608a1632c30084e7f00b4a","amp;dn":"Forever+Female+%281953%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Ginger+Rogers%2C+William+Holden+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91e17affe2f6ba25f4608a1632c30084e7f00b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,225,122,255,226,246,186,37,244,96,138,22,50,195,0,132,231,240,11,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
