This set collects some of the highlights from that period, and while it includes wonderful early signature pieces like &quot;Traneing In&quot; and &quot;Bahia,&quot; the full measure of Coltrane's talent and vision (and heroin-free music) was still mostly off in the future when these recordings were made.\n\n01 - I Hear a Rhapsody\n02 - Nutty\n03 - Soultrane\n04 - I Love You\n05 - Lover Come Back to Me\n06 - Good Bait\n07 - Traneing In\n08 - Freight Trane\n09 - Theme for Ernie\n10 - Bahia\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:028eed2c6e737be8d6d473ed28b137e73de0b277","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+The+Very+Best+of+John+Coltrane+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"028eed2c6e737be8d6d473ed28b137e73de0b277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,142,237,44,110,115,123,232,214,212,115,237,40,177,55,231,61,224,178,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
