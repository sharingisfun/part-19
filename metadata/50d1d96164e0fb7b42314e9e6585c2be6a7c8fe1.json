It's a trap: when a ship-load from France arrives in Odessa, only a physician and his family are spared execution or prison. He and his French wife (her passport ripped up) are sent to Kiev. She wants to return to France immediately; he knows that they are captives and must watch every step. By chance, she meets a touring French actress and pleads for help. She also takes a young swimmer under her wing, and several years later, he makes a bold attempt to escape. Meanwhile, the KGB is suspicious, and hope for freedom is dim. Patience, her husband's self control, and her good looks may be their only assets.\n\n\nCREDITS:\n\n\nDirector\n\tRÃƒÂ©gis Wargnier\nProducers\n\tYves Marmion\n\tAlexander Rodnyansky\nWriters\n\tRustam Ibragimbekov\n\tSergei Bodrov\n\tRÃƒÂ©gis Wargnier\nStarring\n\tSandrine Bonnaire\n\tCatherine Deneuve\n\tOleg Menshikov\n\tBohdan Stupka\nMusic\n\tPatrick Doyle\nCinematographer\n\tLaurent Dailland\nEditor\n\tHervÃƒÂ© Schneid\nDistributor\n\tUnion GÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale CinÃƒÂ©matographique (UGC)\nReleased\n\t1999\nRuntime\n\t121 minutes\nCountries\n\tBulgaria\n\tFrance\n\tRussia\n\tSpain\n\tUkraine\nLanguages\n\tFrench\n\tRussian\nWon\n    2000 Miami International Film Festival: Audience Award\n    2000 Palm Springs International Film Festival: Audience Award\n    2000 Santa Barbara International Film Festival: Audience Choice Award\nNominated\n    1999 Golden Globes: Best Foreign Language Film\n    1999 CÃƒÂ©sar Awards:\n        Best Film\n        Best Actress: Sandrine Bonnaire\n        Best Director: Regis Wargnier\n        Best Music: Patrick Doyle\n    1999 Academy Awards: Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film Ã¢â‚¬â€ Regis Wargnier\n    1999 National Board of Review Awards: Best Foreign Film\n\n\n=========\n\nIf problems or inconsistencies with any of the content files are noticed, please let me know via the comments and I will attempt to upload some corrected replacements.
