He proceeds to examine the Fed's policies of the 1920s, demonstrating that it was quite inflationary even if the effects did not show up in the price of goods and services. He showed that the stock market correction was merely one symptom of the investment boom that led inevitably to a bust. \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:286d61a1566c5e51ee7fdac6b0eb25d8618e5768","amp;dn":"America%5C%27s+Great+Depression+-+M.+Rothbard+-+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"286d61a1566c5e51ee7fdac6b0eb25d8618e5768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,109,97,161,86,108,94,81,238,127,218,198,176,235,37,216,97,142,87,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
