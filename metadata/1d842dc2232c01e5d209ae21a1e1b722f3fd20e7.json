The demos were intended for Hidalgo's main group, Los Lobos, but producer/keyboardist Froom thought the demos were interesting enough on their own to justify a new band. With Los Lobos member PÃƒÂ©rez, and Froom's frequent production partner Blake, Latin Playboys was formed.\n\nThe group released two albums, Latin Playboys, in 1994, and Dose, in 1999. The songs &quot;Manifold de Amour&quot; and &quot;Forever Night Shade Mary,&quot; both from the 1994 self-titled debut album, are featured on the soundtrack album for the 1995 film Desperado.\n\nCritic Richie Unterberger described their music as &quot;a twisted and avant-garde take on roots music. Latin Playboys draw from blues, border music, experimental studio trickery, and cinematic sound textures.&quot;[1]\n\nfrom Wikipeidia.com\n\nDose, 1999\nTrack listing\nFiesta Erotica 3:09\nCuca's Blues 3:14\nIronsides 1:46\nMustard 3:28\nNubian Priestess 1:59\nDose 2:33\nLatin Trip 2:58\nTormenta Blvd. 2:08\nLemon 'n Ice 3:50\nLocoman (LP Version) 2:48\nToro (LP Version) 0:38\nPaletero (LP Version) 3:13\nPaula y Fred (LP Version) 3:06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d842dc2232c01e5d209ae21a1e1b722f3fd20e7","amp;dn":"Latin+Playboys+-+Dose+%5B1999%5D+-+CD+Rip+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d842dc2232c01e5d209ae21a1e1b722f3fd20e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,132,45,194,35,44,1,229,210,9,174,33,161,225,183,34,243,253,32,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
