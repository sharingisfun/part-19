An unlikely hero, Joon, often appears to save Timus, which Timus views as miracles. Timus tells the story of his own coming of age, his loss of innocence and how Joon tries to get a little of that innocence back. Nobody shares Timus's point of view, but Joon however goes on to do a little more saving in the community.\n\nThe film combines the magical world of childhood with the stark reality in which we live. \n\nCast: Paul Loots, Rika Sennett, Deon Lotz, Andrew Thompson, John-Henry Opperman, Altus Theart, Desire Gardner, Beate Olwagen, Lida Botha, Eddie de Jager, Paul LÃƒÂ¼ckhoff, Isabella Mostert, Andrea de Jager \nDirector: Paul Eilers\nMusic: Dawie de Jager\nGenre: Drama\n\nRunning Time: 115 \nAge restriction: 16 LVP\nLanguage: Afrikaans\n\nTrailer :\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5a01d7a31d70dea58b9b196426fbd97adace75c","amp;dn":"roepman+-+stargazer+2011+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5a01d7a31d70dea58b9b196426fbd97adace75c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,160,29,122,49,215,13,234,88,185,177,150,66,111,189,151,173,172,231,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
