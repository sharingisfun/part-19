Unfortunatly it's a VHS-rip with a not so good audio quality. Besides, you will notice that almost every lecture is a little out-of-sync. Due to convertion issues, most lectures have also been splitted into two parts. I'm sorry if any of these causes you trouble, but I assure that during the two weeks I've been working on the files, I did my best. ........\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf19ae7f454ae7516342e6511b287b3fe794709","amp;dn":"TTC+Video+-+Cosmic+Questions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf19ae7f454ae7516342e6511b287b3fe794709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,241,154,231,244,84,174,117,22,52,46,101,17,178,135,179,254,121,71,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
