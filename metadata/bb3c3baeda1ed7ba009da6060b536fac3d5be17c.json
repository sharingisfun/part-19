The band gave us the lowdown on each track off their impressive self-titled EP, including the story behind &quot;Chimera&quot;, the gorgeous shoegazey pop tune that made triple j sit up and take note... They're embarking on a national tour in December, so go catch them live and maybe buy them a drink. Check ID first though.
