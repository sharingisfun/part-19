Theirs is a makeshift family, until it is riven by an incident of violence-of both hand and heartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that sets fire to the rest of their lives.\n\nDivisadero takes us from the city of San Francisco to the raucous backrooms of NevadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s casinos and eventually to the landscape of south-central France. It is here, outside a small rural village, that Anna becomes immersed in the life and the world of a writer from an earlier time-Lucien Segura. His compelling story, which has its beginnings at the turn of the century, circles around &quot;the raw truth&quot; of AnnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own life, the one sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s left behind but can never truly leave. And as the narrative moves back and forth in time and place, we discover each of the characters managing to find some foothold in a present rough hewn from the past. \n\nBreathtakingly evoked and with unforgettable characters, Divisadero is a multilayered novel about passion, loss, and the unshakable past, about the often discordant demands of family, love, and memory. It is Michael OndaatjeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most intimate and beautiful novel to date.\n\n - - - - -\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly:\n\nHope Davis reads Ondaatje's puzzle of a novel delicately, as if hesitant to jostle a single piece out of place. Often playing emotionally frazzled characters on screen, Davis is far more understated here in offering up Ondaatje's hybrid narrativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one that goes from 1970s San Francisco to early 20th-century France, linking past and present with loose tendrils of memory and history. She does a fine job with the tricky French names and nomenclature, and puts her natural gifts as an actor to good use with her subtle, understated, well-oiled reading. Davis still sounds as no-nonsense as ever, but her skilled reading offers a good deal more patience and tenderness than her often-testy characters do. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b26b081e3b2ba7c443b406974fee8390c86af9","amp;dn":"DIVISADERO+-+Michael+Ondaatje.+Read+by+Hope+Davis+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b26b081e3b2ba7c443b406974fee8390c86af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,178,107,8,30,59,43,167,196,67,180,6,151,79,238,131,144,200,106,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
