Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba84c93c288615e701e2e7631164212265afe3b9","amp;dn":"Zombie+Land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba84c93c288615e701e2e7631164212265afe3b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,132,201,60,40,134,21,231,1,226,231,99,17,100,33,34,101,175,227,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
