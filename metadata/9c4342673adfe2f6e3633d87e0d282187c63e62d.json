This book reaches out to managers, developers, and customers who use industry-standard methodologies, but whose projects still struggle to succeed.\n\nAuthor George Stepanek analyzes the project management methodology itself, a critical factor that has thus far been overlooked. He explains why it creates problems for software development projects and begins by describing 12 ways in which software projects are different from other kinds of projects. He also analyzes the project management body of knowledge to discover 10 hidden assumptions that are invalid in the context of software projects.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: Why Software Projects Fail\nChapter 1.
