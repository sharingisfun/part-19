It provides scientific answers to questions that arise when looking at the world around us. It starts with the basics of weatherâ€”temperature, pressure, humidity, and windâ€”before moving on to cover highs, lows, fronts, and storms, and finally ending with a look at weather forecasts, cloud watching, weather tools, and much more. The Handbook of Meteorology provides a condensed but all-inclusive broad sweep of meteorology, employing several illustrations to translate detailed technical information into terms that everyone can follow and readily refer to. It is a comprehensive reference for any budding meteorologist or environmental professional in the field, laboratory, or classroom","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ba147dfdf4af1137ad5486df0922b4d25e2369","amp;dn":"The+Handbook+of+Meteorology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ba147dfdf4af1137ad5486df0922b4d25e2369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,186,20,125,253,244,175,17,55,173,84,134,223,9,34,180,210,94,35,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
