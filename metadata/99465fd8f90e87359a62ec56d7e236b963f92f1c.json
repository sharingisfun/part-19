An episode of peace which, by the way, only lasted ten years in the end. According to Creosote, this time he is Ã¢â‚¬Å“backed by a posse of superhot minstrels that spans a BBC songbird, a northern star and a bygone Iron Maiden moonlighter.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nThe songs were written in the Scottish region of East Neuk in the spring of 2010, except Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which is a new version of the track by Gummi Bako.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99465fd8f90e87359a62ec56d7e236b963f92f1c","amp;dn":"King+Creosote...I+Learned+From+The+King%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99465fd8f90e87359a62ec56d7e236b963f92f1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,70,95,216,249,14,135,53,154,98,236,86,215,226,54,185,99,249,47,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
