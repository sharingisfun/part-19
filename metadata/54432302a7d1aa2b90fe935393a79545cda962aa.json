This one broke an unparalleled string of 10 #1 albums in a row, dating from the release of Let It Bleed in 1969. Dirty Work only made it to #3 in the UK and #4 in the US, making it the lowest charting for a studio album since the US release of The Rolling Stones, Now! only went to #5 in 1965.\nThe album includes the single hits Harlem Shuffle and One Hit (To The Body). Most people know the music, so in my reviews I try to give you data on the sessions and interesting facts connected with the songs and the album. Here we go:\n\nInteresting notes include:\n.....the working title for the album was 19 Stitches\n.....the final cut (Sleep Tonight) is followed by a boogie-woogie piano fadeout memorial to Ian Steward, the real 6th Rolling Stone, who died Dec 12, 1985, just before the album was released and dedicated to him\n.....Mick brought essentially nothing to the sessions because he had used all his latest ideas for his first solo album She's The Boss (Keith had threatened to &quot;slit his......throat&quot; if he toured with another band), so Keith took over the sessions and ran the band when Mick left to promote his album. When Mick returned, he used a different studio and worked at times when he would not be in the building with Keith.....If you watch the videos for One Hit and Fight you can actually see the (real) anger between them....they made up when the Stones played a memorial gig for Ian Steward Feb 28, 1986 at the 100 Club in Oxford St, London....They were billed as Rocket 86....(If you don't know rock history, that's the 1st rock and roll record, Ike Turner's Rocket 88, minus Brian and Ian).\n.....things were so bad with the band that when a reporter asked Charlie what he thought of the album he said he didn't know it was out and asked if it was any good\n\nThe Dirty Work sessions occurred in early 1985 in Paris. Final mixing was done in New York at RPM Studios (Jul 16 - Aug 17 &amp; Sep 10 - Oct 15, 1985) and at Right Track Studios (Nov 15 - Dec 5, 1985).\nJan 23 - Mar 2, 1985 at Pathe Marconi/EMI Studios in Paris\n.....One Hit (To The Body)\n.....Fight\n.....Harlem Shuffle\n.....Hold Back\n.....Too Rude\n.....Winning Ugly\n.....Back To Zero\n.....Dirty Work\n.....Had It With You\n.....Sleep Tonight\n\nThe Paris Dirty Work sessions produced a number of unreleased tracks, including What Am I Supposed To Do, Baby You're Too Much, Deep Love, Sending Out An Invitation, Some Of Us Are On Our Knees, For Your Precious Love, Strictly Memphis, What Are You Goin' To Do With My Love.\n\nThis information comes from &quot;It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones&quot; by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection, with some of the notes from Davis' &quot;Old Gods Almost Dead.&quot;\n\nby Richard R.
