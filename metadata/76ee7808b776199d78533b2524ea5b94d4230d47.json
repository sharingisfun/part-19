She had a distinctive voice, able to do heartbreaking and lighthearted equally as thrillingly. She had an unerring sense of melody and her phrasing is a thing of beauty. This collection covers her work in the mid-'50s for Decca both with small groups and larger orchestras. She shines on swinging tracks like &quot;Comes Love,&quot; &quot;Falling in Love With Love,&quot; and &quot;I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket&quot; and won't leave a dry eye in the house with her deeply emotional ballad singing. &quot;Do You Know Why,&quot; &quot;Midnight Sun,&quot; and the achingly beautiful &quot;I'm Glad There Is You&quot; are prime examples of McRae's way with a ballad. Each of the 16 tracks here is like a primer on how to be a vocalist, jazz or otherwise. McRae's entry in Verve's Diva Series is a fine introduction to her 1950s recordings.
