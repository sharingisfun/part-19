It's a World War II adventure featuring a young Steve Rogers, the Black Panther and Nick Fury and his Howling Commandos in combat with the nastiest Nazi villains in the Marvel Universe!&quot;\n\nThis great limited series is written by Reginald Hudlin with art by Denys Cowan. There are a few different copies of the individual issues out there; after checking them all out, these 2013 Bchry-DCP scans are the best IMHO. Thanks to that group for their usual excellent work; please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2204f5ec0e21439c78209995fd27ba95e3aa0399","amp;dn":"Captain+America%2FBlack+Panther+-+Flags+Of+Our+Fathers+%282010%7CDCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2204f5ec0e21439c78209995fd27ba95e3aa0399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,4,245,236,14,33,67,156,120,32,153,149,253,39,186,149,227,170,3,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
