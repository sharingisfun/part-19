The great thing about this is that it doesn't play as something just for the devoted -- it's quite enjoyable for anyone who's a fan of Skynyrd's classic work. This does have some historically significant material, namely the inclusion of the early, pre-Skynyrd &quot;Shade Tree Recordings,&quot; cut between 1968 and 1970, and the &quot;Quinvy Recordings&quot; from 1970. There are also outtakes from Second Helping and Street Survivors, and a full album's worth of live material recorded either at the Fox Theater in 1976 or on  WMC-FM in 1973. Nothing is particularly revelatory, even the early recording of &quot;Free Bird,&quot; but it's all of high quality and anything that adds to classic Skynyrd's body of work is welcome indeed. \n \n  Track Listing....: \n CD1 \n \n 01.Free bird [07:29] \n 02.Need all my friends [03:18] \n 03.Michelle [02:57] \n 04.If i'm wrong [05:30] \n 05.No one can take your place [05:25] \n 06.Hide your face [02:59] \n 07.Bad boy blues [07:48] \n 08.Memphis [03:21] \n 09.I ain't the one [04:00] \n (live on WMC-FM 1973) \n 10.Call me the breeze [05:51] \n (live on WMC-FM 1973) \n 11.Sweet home alabama [04:55] \n (live on WMC-FM 1973) \n 12.Woman of mine [06:33] \n (live on WMC-FM 1973) \n 13.Workin' for MCA [05:07] \n (live on WMC-FM 1973) \n 14.Free bird [10:36] \n (live on WMC-FM 1973) \n \n CD2 \n \n 01.Need all my friends [05:11] \n (complete version) \n 02.Michelle (complete version) [05:44] \n 03.Saturday night special [06:51] \n 04.Whiskey rock-A-roller [04:27] \n 05.Gimme three steps [04:43] \n 06.Call me the breeze [05:46] \n 07.I never dreamed [04:55] \n (alternate version) \n 08.You got that right [03:28] \n (alternate version) \n 09.T for texas [10:16] \n 10.Crossroads [04:00] \n 11.Jacksonville kid [04:07] \n 12.Free bird [14:58] \n (live at the fox theater 197 \n ____ \n \n 150:15 min \n 218,9 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b5c380cb8abe5d83ace391488d35258f48ae0fc","amp;dn":"Lynyrd_Skynyrd-Collectybles-2CD-%28Retail%29-2000-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b5c380cb8abe5d83ace391488d35258f48ae0fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,92,56,12,184,171,229,216,58,206,57,20,136,211,82,88,244,138,224,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
