He also discusses the large difference between public opinion on the Cold War, establishment American educated opinion and reality.\nThe book also contains criticism aimed at the Soviet Union and other communist states, but makes a major point to the fact that if the United States really supported &quot;freedom&quot; in the cold war, then why did it still support authoritarian regimes? The conclusion that Chomsky comes to is that the U.S did not really care about supporting freedom, but rather maintaining dominance over resources and geopolitical power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8524f9656d891b96622720d3e7b145eba44bbf5c","amp;dn":"Deterring+Democracy+by+Noam+Chomsky+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8524f9656d891b96622720d3e7b145eba44bbf5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,36,249,101,109,137,27,150,98,39,32,211,231,177,69,235,164,75,191,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
