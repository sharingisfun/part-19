Secondly, it was at this show where Rob had his famous motorcycle accident which knocked him out for the duration of opening number Hell Bent for Leather, making it so far the only time in history that this song was played as an instrumental.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n    Intro-Hell Bent for Leather\n    Heading Out to the Highway\n    The Hellion/Electric Eye\n    All Guns Blazing\n    Metal Gods\n    Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\n    The Ripper\n    Night Crawler\n    A Touch of Evil\n    Painkiller\n    The Green Manalishi\n    Breaking the Law\n    Living After Midnight\n    You've Got Another Thing Comin'\n\nVenue and date: CNE Grandstand, Toronto, Canada, 19th August 1991\nbit rate=320kbps\nmp3 format\nfile size=167mb\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4248ac1c31b4daa3d4b07ff01924c7c46b44bb1c","amp;dn":"Judas+Priest+End+of+an+Era-Live+bootleg-1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4248ac1c31b4daa3d4b07ff01924c7c46b44bb1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,72,172,28,49,180,218,163,212,176,127,240,25,36,199,196,107,68,187,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
