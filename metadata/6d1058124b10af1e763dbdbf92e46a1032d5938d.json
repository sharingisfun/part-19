He stated that he had been here for three months as part of a United States Army unit on a special operation to bring back an obsolete computer system, and that he would be happy to post pictures of his time machine and answer questions about it.\nSeveral people had already attempted a hoax of this kind unsuccessfully, so many immediately dismissed his claim as no more than that. But as people started to question him, they realised that this was somewhat different to &amp;#039;usual&amp;#039; hoaxes. Titor had a lot to say and with his answers becoming increasingly intriguing, people began wondering whether they hadn&amp;#039;t underestimated his claims.\nPictures of his time machine did indeed materialise of a ?C204 Gravity Distortion Time Displacement Unit&amp;#039; including several pages from it&amp;#039;s supposed operating manual. The continual peppering by hundreds of tough, well thought out questions on all kinds of subjects carried on about the details of his mission, life in 2036, the advanced physics behind his time machine and his opinions on us and our time. He continued to relentlessly, albeit calmly, answer them for over 6 months.\nJohn gradually painted a picture of his time in which life is very different and the world is slowly recovering from a massive but short World War III which claimed the lives of 3 billion people in 2015.\n\n\n==\n\nBest Viewed with !DAMN!
