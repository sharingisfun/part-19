I bought the eBook, opened it with Adobe Digital Editions, printed it as a Microsoft XPS Document Writer, opened the .xps file with Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional, saved it as .pdf, and got this file.\n\nIt is a compilation of images of the pages of the book and in spite of their quality is good, the text cannot be selectable nor copied.\n\nIf anyone knows a way to convert the eBook file (it is a .pdf) to a pdf with selectable text, just let me know.\n\nCheers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f2d6dec4636ccb16e84e4d729f6392179395473","amp;dn":"Ace+the+Technical+Pilot+Interview","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f2d6dec4636ccb16e84e4d729f6392179395473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,45,109,236,70,54,204,177,110,132,228,215,41,246,57,33,121,57,84,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
