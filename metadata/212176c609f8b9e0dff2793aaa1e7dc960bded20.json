Long-considered one of the world's greatest artists, he excelled in capturing the beauty of life on canvas. In private, he destroyed whomever he pleased: his wife, his son, his mistress, his dearest friends and family. Fittingly, Maitland has paid for his sins. But in a world where self-delusion is rewarded, where greed triumphs, and where murder is just another art, who else will pay the price?\nGenre: Mystery/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:212176c609f8b9e0dff2793aaa1e7dc960bded20","amp;dn":"Second+Deadly+Sin+-+Lawrence+Sanders.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"212176c609f8b9e0dff2793aaa1e7dc960bded20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,33,118,198,9,248,185,224,223,242,121,58,170,30,125,201,96,189,237,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
