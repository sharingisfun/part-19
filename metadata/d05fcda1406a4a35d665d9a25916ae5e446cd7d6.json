In the song, the singer finds drinking red wine is the only way to forget a lost love.\n\nVorsicht Musik (Caution, music!) was a music show, which ran from October 11, 1982 to January 4 1984 with a total of eleven episodes on ZDF.\n\nUB40 made their rendition for their cover versions album Labour of Love. According to the band, they were only familiar with Tony Tribe's version, and their version featured a lighter, reggae-style flavor compared to Diamond's somber, acoustic ballad. This version reached number one in the UK chart in August 1983, and number thirty-four in the U.S. in March 1984. This cover version adds a toasted verse by UB40 member Astro, opening: &quot;Red Red Wine, you make me feel so fine/You keep me rocking all of the time&quot;.\n\nUB40 are a British reggae band formed in 1978 in Birmingham. The band has placed more than 50 singles in the UK Singles Chart, and has also achieved considerable international success. One of the world's best-selling music artists, UB40 have sold over 70 million records.\n\nTheir No.1 hit singles include their first number 1 &quot;Food for Thought&quot; and two U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number ones with &quot;Red Red Wine&quot; and &quot;Can't Help Falling in Love&quot;, while &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; also topped the UK singles chart.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;kulter HD&quot; logo at the top left)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Red_Wine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Red_Wine&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mabgNaAEa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mabgNaAEa&lt;/a&gt; \n    \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Layer 2 Audio 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:35\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
