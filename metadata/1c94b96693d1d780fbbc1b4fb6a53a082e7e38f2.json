With over 8 billion pages online and more posted every day, the Web more than likely contains the information youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for Ã¢â‚¬â€ if only you could find it.\n\nIn Information Trapping: Real-Time Research on the Web, Internet-search-engine expert Tara Calishain makes researching more efficient and rewarding for anyone for whom the Web is an indispensable tool Ã¢â‚¬â€ academics, journalists, scientists, and professionals, as well as bloggers, genealogists, and hobbyists. She does so by teaching the latest techniques for building automated information-gathering systems. As an alternative to the typical one-time search for information, Tara demonstrates how readers can use RSS feeds, page monitoring tools, and other software to set up information streams of many different data types Ã¢â‚¬â€ from text to multimedia to conversations Ã¢â‚¬â€ for capture and review.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c94b96693d1d780fbbc1b4fb6a53a082e7e38f2","amp;dn":"Information+Trapping%3A+Real-Time+Research+on+the+Web+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c94b96693d1d780fbbc1b4fb6a53a082e7e38f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,148,185,102,147,209,215,128,251,188,27,79,182,165,58,8,46,126,56,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
