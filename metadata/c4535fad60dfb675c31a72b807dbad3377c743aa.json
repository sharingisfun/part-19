Synchronized global teams of thieves are pilfering immense volumes of high-value products, counterfeiting even more--and using the profits to support the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most vicious terrorists and criminal gangs.\nIn this eye-opening piece of investigative journalism, top business reporter Hitha Prabhakar connects the dots and follows the money deep into the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fastest-growing criminal industry. You'll learn how the Internet, social media, and disposable cell phones have opened the floodgates for a new generation of criminals--and how buying something as innocent as a counterfeit handbag or discounted cigarettes actually funds terrorist groups from Al-Qaeda to Central AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drug lords.\nBlack Market Billions draws on extensive first person interviews with law enforcement, industry, and the criminals themselves to reveal how retail crime rings impact the security in every country in which they operate. Prabhakar goes &quot;inside&quot; to reveal why the piracy economy has exploded...why preventive measures have failed...and what to expect next, as organized retail crime reaches a terrifying critical mass.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Business","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4535fad60dfb675c31a72b807dbad3377c743aa","amp;dn":"Black+Market+Billions_+How+Organized+Retail+Crime+Fuerrorists+%28G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4535fad60dfb675c31a72b807dbad3377c743aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,83,95,173,96,223,182,117,195,26,114,184,7,219,173,51,119,199,67,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
