Later on, the Milford Mute. The Golden Boy. The Young Ghost. The Kid. The Boxman. The Lock Artist. That was all me.\nBut you can call me Mike.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nMarked by tragedy, traumatized at the age of eight, Michael, now eighteen, is no ordinary young man. Besides not uttering a single word in ten years, he discovers the one thing he can somehow do better than anyone else. Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a locked door without a key, a padlock with no combination, or even an eight-hundred pound safe Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ he can open them all.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an unforgivable talent. A talent that will make young Michael a hot commodity with the wrong people and, whether he likes it or not, push him ever close to a life of crime. Until he finally sees his chance to escape, and with one desperate gamble risks everything to come back home to the only person he ever loved, and to unlock the secret that has kept him silent for so long.\nSteve Hamilton steps away from his Edgar Award-winning Alex McKnight series to introduce a unique new character, unlike anyone youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever seen in the world of crime fiction.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR \n\nSteve Hamilton is one of the most critically acclaimed writers in the world, and one of only two authors to win Edgars for both Best First Novel and Best Novel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceff802f9c7223cf28c9f589ac7748f08cc15f07","amp;dn":"The+Lock+Artist%7CEPUB%7C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceff802f9c7223cf28c9f589ac7748f08cc15f07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,255,128,47,156,114,35,207,40,201,245,137,172,119,72,240,140,193,95,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
