Separated from his wife, Martin (Charles Berling) is intrigued when he sees an elderly painter with plump teen Cecilia (Sophie Guillemin). When he later learns that the man has died, Martin meets Cecilia, and asks her intimate questions about her relationship with the painter. Martin begins a passionate affair with the detached Cecilia, who offers only monosyllabic responses to his detailed probing questions. When Martin learns Cecilia is seeing a man much younger than himself, his full-bloomed fixation pushes him over an emotional precipice. \n\n\n\n\nCast:\n\tCharles Berling\t\t... \tMartin\n\tSophie Guillemin\t... \tCÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cilia\n\tArielle Dombasle\t... \tSophie\n\tRobert Kramer\t\t... \tMeyers\n\tAlice Grey\t\t... \tCÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cilia's Mother\n\tMaurice Antoni\t\t... \tCÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cilia's Father\n\tTom Ouedraogo\t\t... \tMomo\n\n\n\n.....................................................\n\n\nFor some screenshots see:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=6&amp;thread=4471&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=6&amp;thread=4471&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n.....................................................\n\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
