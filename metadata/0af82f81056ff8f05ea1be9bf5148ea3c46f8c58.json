Parents wonder how to protect their children when almost every day the news reports another incident of someone in authority arrested on suspicion of child abuse from clergy and teachers to family members themselves. Even law enforcement has had trouble defining the problem and only recently has the Department of Justice begun recording statistics of sexual assault against children. Amid the confusion generated by sensational news reports and uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of child sexual abuse, what can parents do?\n\n In this straightforward, clearly written guidebook, veteran sex-crimes prosecutor and Los Angeles deputy district attorney Robin Sax answers one hundred questions that she has most often encountered in her fifteen years of experience. From the definition of abuse to the profiles of a predator to how to report an incident and to whom, Sax provides practical, reassuring, and appropriate information.\n\n For ease of use, the book is organized into six major sections:\n\n -Recognizing predators: molesters, pedophiles, and opportunists\n -Talking to kids about risks and identifying potential problems\n -Recognizing abuse\n -Reporting sexual abuse\n -Going to court\n -Healing and moving on\n\n Sax makes it clear that protecting children begins with every parent in the home. Parents must view protecting children from the potential of sexual assault as a priority. Teaching children preventive measures should be viewed as important as teaching kids how to dial 9-1-1.\n\n Sax concludes by emphasizing that the best defense against sexual offenders is information. Her book provides realistic answers to empower parents and educators, even in the face of one of life's scariest threats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0af82f81056ff8f05ea1be9bf5148ea3c46f8c58","amp;dn":"Predators+and+Child+Molesters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0af82f81056ff8f05ea1be9bf5148ea3c46f8c58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,248,47,129,5,111,248,240,94,161,190,155,245,20,142,163,196,111,140,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
