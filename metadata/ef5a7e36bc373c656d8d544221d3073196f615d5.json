Most Google products like Google Desktop, Google Chrome, Google Picasa, Google Earth and Google Toolbar collect data about the usage, generate a unique ID and transfer them back to Google. GoogleClean can prevent this and switches off those data transfers. It allows you to use all Google products without any headaches and without having to worry about the consequences. GoogleClean does not influence the functionality of Google products. It takes away the bad things and leaves you the good things.\r\n\r\nSwitch off Google spy functionality:\r\nMany Google Applications collect Information about their users and send data back home. Google exactly knows which websites you visit and what contents you are looking for in the internet. It is almost impossible to deactivate some of these spy features manually. With GoogleClean you can switch off those data transfers easily.\r\n\r\nSupported Google-Applications:\r\nGoogleClean supports Google Web Applications (Web Search, Mail, Maps, etc.), YouTube, Google Chrome, Google Analytics Tracking (included into many websites), Google Toolbar, Google Desktop Search, Google Earth, Google Updater and Google Picasa.\r\n\r\nCleans Tracking-Cookies:\r\nTracking-Cookies were invented to observe your surfing behavior.

You can change that now! With the new &quot;google remove proposal&quot;-feature you are able to request the removal of those entries. Get back your privacy.
