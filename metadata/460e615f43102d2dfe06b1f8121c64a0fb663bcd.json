SimCity was challenging and plausibly realistic and even had a surprising amount of humor, especially for a game with a seemingly mundane subject. About 15 years have passed since the original SimCity was first released, and while the classic SimCity series is still well known among PC gamers, it has only reached its fourth full installment. And SimCity 4 for the most part isn't a huge departure from its predecessors, either, not that it really needs to be. The game does have a number of new features and a few additional layers of depth on top of the preceding SimCity 3000, and its visuals have been impressively overhauled. However, due to the presence of some stability and performance issues, as well as a few noticeably lacking features, SimCity 4 doesn't seem as polished as it could have been. On the other hand, it's still a complex and detailed strategy game that can entertain you for hours on end and even teach you a thing or two.\n\nSimCity 4 is similar to its predecessors, but it offers a number of interesting new features.\n\nOne of the biggest changes to the gameplay of SimCity 4 is evident from the start. Immediately as you begin the game, you're presented with a view of SimNation, though it's not much of a nation at first. SimNation is divided up into numerous smaller square segments, yet each of these in fact can hold an entire city of your making. These cities can even interact to some extent, exchanging surplus energy, water, and such for cash. At any rate, getting started is as easy as clicking on any SimNation square, naming your city, and appointing yourself as mayor, and you're off. But before you begin, you may wish to take the step-by-step tutorials of the game's mayor modeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the heart of SimCity 4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the god mode, where you can terraform the land to your heart's content, making the terrain as flat, as hilly, as undulating, or as improbably strange as you like. It's easy to use the terrain-morphing tools found in this mode, and while it's perfectly viable to just pick one of the ready-made territories to start your city in, it's tempting and straightforward to custom-tailor your own. \n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\nOperating System: Windows XP/ME/2000/98 (Windows 95/NT not supported)\nCPU: 500 MHz Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon processor\nRAM: 128 MB\nCD/DVD-Rom Speed: 8X\nHard Drive Space: 1 gig plus space for saved games\nVideo: 16 MB video card, DirectX 7 compatible\nSound: DirectX 7.0 compatible\nInput: Keyboard, mouse ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:460e615f43102d2dfe06b1f8121c64a0fb663bcd","amp;dn":"SimCity+4+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"460e615f43102d2dfe06b1f8121c64a0fb663bcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,14,97,95,67,16,45,45,254,6,177,248,18,28,100,160,251,102,59,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
