Over 1,000 full-color photomicrographs depict abnormalities within each blood cell line, with multiple pictures of each morphologic abnormality and variations in their appearance. Written by pathology experts Amy Valenciano, Rick Cowell, Theresa Rizzi, and Ronald Tyler, this concise reference will enhance your skills as you interpret blood smears and recognize hematological cellular response to inflammation, infection, and toxicity.\n\nOver 1,000 photomicrographs facilitate microscopic analysis and interpretation of the cellular components of the blood.\nFull-color, high-resolution images facilitate identification of different blood cell types, numbers, anomalies and conditions.\nMultiple representations of morphologic abnormalities aid in recognition of conditions where variations in appearance commonly occur.\nPractical information includes an overview of laboratory methods, equipment and supplies, sample collection, staining and handling, and diagnostic interpretation of blood smears.\nCoverage of 125 topics ranges from the morphology of erythrocytes to chronic myeloid leukemia.\nSpiral binding allows the book to lay open next to the microscope, making it a quick and easy reference while on the job.\n\n\nContent\n\nIntroduction: Blood Smear Preparation and Examination\nSection 1: General Assessment\nSection 2: Red Blood Cells\nSection 3: White Blood Cells\nSection 4: Platelets\nSection 5: Hematopoietic Neoplasia\nSection 6: Extracellular Organisms\nAppendix: Reticulocyte Count\nAppendix: Saline Dilution/Dispersion Test \n\n\nPLEASE SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16bb62cd451c649fdc3f063edf40e0ae1b1ea954","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+Canine+and_Feline+Peripheral+Blood+Smears+%5BPDF%5D%5B2014%5D%28t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16bb62cd451c649fdc3f063edf40e0ae1b1ea954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,187,98,205,69,28,100,159,220,63,6,62,223,64,224,174,27,30,169,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
