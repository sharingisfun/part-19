Now based in New York and married to trumpeter Alex Sipiagin, Monday Michiru has also gained significant recognition among the Stateside hip-hop and acid-jazz crowds, but remains less well known among more mainstream jazz fans. Soulception, its title referring to insights gained from the soul rather than to some sort of Motown mash-up, may be an ideal entry point for a wider audience, its multi-shaded sensibility suggesting an East-meets-West vibe reflective of the vocalistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Japanese-American heritage. She is the daughter of two esteemed jazz artists: pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi and the late Boston-born saxophonist Charlie Mariano.\n\nFollowing a spoken-word introduction that sets up the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiritual impetus, Michiru dives into the chanting, metronomic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Adventures,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ its sharp edges ultimately smoothed by Sipiagin, bassist Boris Kozlov and guitarist Adam Rogers. Her outrÃƒÂ© leanings are equally evident across the staccato Ã¢â‚¬Å“What Is a Soul,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a sort of trans-universal search for enlightenment. Then, suddenly, Michiru settles into a mellow reading of Milton NascimentoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bridges,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring Ed Motta on companion vocals. Her wordless Ã¢â‚¬Å“Native TongueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ starts off as soft as spring rain, progressing to a fully funkified dance of joy. Quietude again invades with the gently reflective Ã¢â‚¬Å“Over and Over.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fresh flames are ignited beneath a magnificently rendered Ã¢â‚¬Å“BrasilianosÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a wonderful showcase for Sipiagin), then tempered for the dewy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Til Morning Comes AgainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the delicate, Rogers-propelled denouement Ã¢â‚¬Å“What Defines You.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:297b32eedd8c0f61e6ee14c108aa667d95cd1e20","amp;dn":"Monday+Michiru+-+Soulception+%5B2012%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"297b32eedd8c0f61e6ee14c108aa667d95cd1e20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,123,50,238,221,140,15,97,230,238,20,193,8,170,102,125,149,205,30,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
