Dating back to 1972, this Spanish TV \nproduction by Antonio Mercero demonstrates perfectly that an innocuous fixture \nin the public sphere can become a source of terror. And the only monsters making \nan appearance in the film are human.\n\nHorror writer Stephen King once likened reading a novel to having a long a \nsatisfying affair. He contrasted that with a short story being like a quick kiss \nin the dark from a stranger. This metaphor can be carried over to films. La \nCabina is a mere 35 minutes long, yet in that time it leaves a lasting \nimpression because of its short and surreal nature. Like any good short horror \nstory it provides no explanations for the situation that the hapless victim \nfinds himself in.\n\nThe story begins with four workmen in a phone company truck arriving at a plaza \nsurrounded by apartment buildings. They unload a red telephone box from the back \nof the truck and install it in the middle of the plaza - leaving its door ajar. \nA human Venus fly trap has been set.\n\nShortly afterwards a middle aged suited man sees his son off to school and then \ndecides to go into the telephone box to make a call. He soon finds that the \nphone is out of order, but while trying it the door has closed behind him. \nInitially puzzled that the door won't open he then starts to become agitated and \ntries to force it open to no avail. He doesn't have to wait long before two men \nwalking by on the way to work spot his predicament and fruitlessly try to pull \nthe door open.\n\nUnfortunately, they can't stick around and have to leave. More people have \nnoticed what's going on and a crowd starts to gather, obviously this is \nentertainment in a town where nothing much normally happens.\n\nThe mood of the film so far is fairly light-hearted, though it's easy to feel \nsympathy for the man whose discomfort and embarrassment has become palpable now \nhe's also become an object of curiosity and amusement. The next few minutes are \nplayed mainly for laughs as several people, including a couple of policemen, try \nto pull the phone box door open only to fail and fall over backward with the \ndoor handle in their hands.\n\nThe crowd itself becomes a source of curiosity, too--there's a tall man stealing \ncakes from a tray a boy holds on his head; an old woman is invited to sit on a \nchair a man was taking somewhere; a couple of workmen stand around with a big \nmirror; and children taunt the trapped man.\n\nSymbolism and homages begin to emerge. For instance, we notice that two of the \nonlookers are women sat chatting and knitting. This is presumably a reference to \nMadame Defarge who sits knitting while people go their deaths in Charles \nDickens' story A Tale Of Two Cities.\n\nEventually, a fire truck arrives and the firemen decide to break the glass of \nthe phone box. One of them gets on top of the box and is just about to smash the \ntop glass with a sledgehammer when the phone company truck comes back, its horn \nbeeping for attention.\n\nThe phone company workmen proceed to load the phone box onto their truck. It's \nat this point that the man inside realizes that something is definitely not \nright about the whole situation. Despite his obvious panic and gestures to the \nworkmen to get him out, the crowd wave him off with cries of &quot;Good luck&quot;. Having \nbeen so close to escape his fate is getting even more puzzling.\n\nLike some kind of peculiar mobile freak show, the truck drives through the town \nwith the trapped man eliciting jokes by passers by and lots of friendly waves. \nMuch to his disappointment people continually misunderstand his gestures for \nhelp. On the way out of town they come to a halt in traffic and by the side of \nthe road is a funeral party standing around a glass casket containing a corpse \non display. This is an unsubtle way of signaling the man's own fate.\n\nA little later, while stopped at traffic lights another phone company truck \npulls up alongside and on it is an identical phone box with a stuck man inside \nit. Looks of empathy and questioning pass between the two men before the other \ntruck pulls away. Our man then becomes even more panicked and desperately tries \nto get the workmen's attention to let him out. This is the first indication that \nsomething more than just an unlucky accident for one person is at work.\n\nBEWARE: SPOILERS AHEAD, STOP READING NOW!!!\nBEWARE: SPOILERS AHEAD, STOP READING NOW!!!\nBEWARE: SPOILERS AHEAD, STOP READING NOW!!!\n\nA neat touch is when we see a man briefly struggling to get out of a phone box \nby the side of the road, but in his case the door soon gives way and he walks \naway little knowing what may have befallen him otherwise.\n\nSo now we know there's a concerted effort going on to capture people. For what \npurpose we can only guess at but will never find out. Around this time the \nsoundtrack becomes portentous with low register rhythms. Driving out of the town \nthere's one final and meaningful encounter with other people. When the truck has \nto again stop some circus dwarves near the road look on, and they are the only \nones to simply look and not laugh or wave.\n\nIn return the man earnestly looks back at them. Maybe the dwarves who are used \nto being stared at because of their appearance identify with the man's situation \nin which he's an object of curiosity and fun. Then blatant symbolism enters when \nthe camera focuses on a ship in a bottle that one of the dwarves is holding.\n\nThe journey continues on winding mountain roads, first up and then down. For \nreasons that aren't obvious a helicopter joins in following the truck from the \nair.\n\nEventually, the final destination gets closer as a tunnel into the mountainside \nis reached. The helicopter lands just outside and the pilot gets out to wave at \nthe man as he enters the tunnel.\n\nAs the truck continues into an underground complex, the soundtrack changes to \nsinister chanting in LatinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦somewhat like that used in The Omen. While driving \nin, they pass men cleaning out phone boxes, and also a truck going the other way \nfull of empty phone boxes. By this time, the man is more anguished but despite \nfrantically banging on the glass he's continually ignored.\n\nAt this point I started to wonder--are the four workmen a metaphor for the Four \nHorsemen of the Apocalypse, or is it just coincidence because four are needed to \nload and unload the phone box?\n\nSoon after, the truck yields its unlikely cargo to an overhead crane that takes \nit away and passes it to a series of conveyor belts. The man's improbable fate \nis then made clear when he's taken past corpses in identical telephone boxes to \nhis own.\n\nComing to a halt the man's phone box is put down next to one containing the \nother victim he saw earlier. That man has strangled himself with the phone cord \nrather than endure a drawn-out death.\n\nIt's all over for the man; he now knows it but still makes a last effort of \nbanging on the glass hoping to be let out. Desperately aware that he's doomed \nthe final shot of him is slowly sliding down the glass of his coffin in despair \nand resignation.\n\nWhat started out as an ordinary day for an ordinary man has turned into the kind \nof thing that nightmares are made of.\n\nTurning full circle, the film ends back at the plaza, where a shiny new \ntelephone box is installed and its door left open. We are left wondering how \nlong it'll be until some other unlucky person attempts to make a call. The \nquestions about what the hell is going on are never answered.\n\nThe trapped man is brilliantly played by Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez, a Spanish \nactor with a substantial list of acting credits to his name.\n\nI first saw this film on TV late at night many years ago, and it's been stuck \nvividly in my memory ever since. It's truly terrifying, playing to archetypal \nfears like people ignoring your pleas for help and being buried alive.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom DVDRESURRECTIONS &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdresurrections.com/MovieReview_LaCabina.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdresurrections.com/MovieReview_LaCabina.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis amazing short film was directed by Antonio Mercero for Spanish television \nin 1972. It's a wonderful example of efficient, lean horror story\ntelling which squeezes in plenty of thrills and shocks in its 40 minute running \ntime.\n\nEssentially a European riff on a Twilight Zone style format, the film begins \nwith a team of workmen installing a new public phone box. Later a man\ndrops his boy off at the nearby bus stop and then pauses to make a call...\n\nBut the phone doesn't work and when he tries to exit he finds himself trapped. \nThe filmmaker makes a lot out of the claustrophobic setting in these\nopening scenes, the box is glass on all four sides leaving our victim exposed \nand embarrassed as a crowd gathers to witness the odd spectacle.\nSmall children taunt him, offering him peanuts and calling him a monkey. Several \npeople offer to help including the police, the local strongman and a\nhandyman with a bag of tools.\n\nSoon, the telephone crew appears to take the box with our hero inside, loading \nit onto a flatbed truck as the amused crowd laugh and wave\ngoodbye to the hapless prisoner.\n\nThe film up to this point is presented as a lightweight comedy, with plenty of \nphysical comedy and pratfalls as the crowd attempt, and fail, to break\nthe man out of the phone box. However, once the booth is fixed to the truck, the \ntone shifts subtly into one of increasing dread.\n\nFirst, the man witnesses another guy successfully leaving a similar booth, \ncausing a look of anguish to cross his face. The film is very clever in this\nregard, working almost in a silent movie style. The trapped man can only mouth \nwords and use exaggerated gestures to communicate.\n\nThe truck drives past a funeral in which a young woman can be seen in a glass \nsided coffin increasing our sense of unease. As the truck pulls up to\na junction alongside another lorry transporting another hapless man-in-a-box our \nguy can barely keep a grip as we finally have our suspicions\nconfirmed and realize that everything is wrong and something sinister is \nafoot...\n\nWho has kidnapped him? Where are they going? What terrible fate is about to \nbefall him?\n\nThe film is a triumph, telling a simple story with an excellent central \nperformance from the lead that has to deliver a huge range of emotions\nthrough body language without turning the whole film into an embarrassing \npantomime. The filmic photography sets this apart from the usual TV\nmovie fare and the varied score, which ranges from playful for the comedic \nopening to apocalyptic during the twisted finale, all help to create a thrill\nride with a shocking ending that will stay with you for a good while afterwards.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMEDIA INFO REPORT\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 681 MiB\nDuration                         : 34mn 23s\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 770 Kbps\nWriting application              : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\nWriting library                  : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fab2939d92bab6cfd4cb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nCodec ID                         : H264\nDuration                         : 34mn 23s\nBit rate                         : 2 312 Kbps\nWidth                            : 688 pixels\nHeight                           : 512 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.263\nStream size                      : 569 MiB (83%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 58 svn-736bm\nEncoding settings                : cabac=1 / ref=1 / deblock=1:-2:-1 / \nanalyse=0x3:0x113 / me=hex / subme=5 / brdo=0 / mixed_ref=0 / me_range=8 / \nchroma_me=1 / trellis=0 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / chroma_qp_offset=0 \n/ threads=2 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / mbaff=0 / bframes=16 / b_pyramid=1 / b_adapt=1 \n/ b_bias=0 / direct=3 / wpredb=1 / bime=0 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / \nscenecut=40(pre) / rc=2pass / bitrate=2312 / ratetol=1.0 / rceq='blurCplx^(1-\nqComp)' / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / \nqblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / pb_ratio=1.30\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 34mn 23s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 110 MiB (16%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6afdf3a04610ed21efb39a0ad228f08605e4129a","amp;dn":"La+Cabina+%28The+Telephone+Box%29+%28Antonio+Mercero%2C+1972%29+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6afdf3a04610ed21efb39a0ad228f08605e4129a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,253,243,160,70,16,237,33,239,179,154,10,210,40,240,134,5,228,18,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
