The funny thing is, it works both ways--as a young man's personal statement about learning to open up to others, and as the frantic theme for an exotic espionage chase comedy starring those lovable mop-tops (this time in color). Like A Hard Day's Night, only the first &quot;side&quot; of this album actually contains songs from the movie--the biggest hits being the\neponymous cry for assistance and &quot;Ticket to Ride.&quot; But part 2 has a few nice tunes as well, like &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; &quot;I've Just Seen a Face,&quot; and a little ditty called &quot;Yesterday.&quot; And I always love it when they do an all-out screamer like &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy,&quot; which sounds like John's raucous answer to Paul's &quot;Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey&quot; vocal on Beatles for Sale. Of course, it's essential--as are all the Beatles' soundtracks (all the Beatles' albums), with the possible exception of Yellow Submarine. --Jim Emerson\n\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
