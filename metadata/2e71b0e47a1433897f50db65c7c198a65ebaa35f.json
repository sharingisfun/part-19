Through discussion, demonstrations and workshops, Pappano explores every aspect of the art of great singing.\n\nThe tenor is opera's glamour boy, the king of the high Cs, the leading man. Whether the tragic hero or the young romantic lead, whether dramatic or lyric, the tenor usually gets the girl, even if they rarely live happily ever after. Antonio examines the techniques behind the bravura performances, featuring great tenors such as Enrico Caruso, Luciano Pavarotti, Franco Corelli, Fritz Wunderlich, Jon Vickers, Peter Pears and Mario Lanza.\n\nWith contributions from leading tenors of today - Jonas Kaufmann, Juan Diego Florez and Jose Carreras - and a voice lesson from Thomas Allen, Antonio seeks out the tricks of the trade. How does a tenor 'colour' his voice? Why do his high notes provoke an animal response in audiences? How does he sing from bottom to top of his two-octave range without seeming to change gear? Why did the tenor only come centre stage in the 1830s? Why is Enrico Caruso still regarded as the greatest and most influential tenor ever? And what does it do to your nerves to sing a high C?\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/9XFGYQEAMW.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/GRzkKdHurx.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e71b0e47a1433897f50db65c7c198a65ebaa35f","amp;dn":"Pappanos.Classical.Voices.s01e02.Tenor.ENG.SUBS.WEBRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e71b0e47a1433897f50db65c7c198a65ebaa35f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,113,176,228,122,20,51,137,127,80,219,101,199,193,152,166,94,186,163,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
