John Coleman&amp;#039;s explosive book The Rothschild Dynasty (2007) which tells the story behind the story on how Mayer Amschel, the founder of the &quot;Red Shield&quot; dynasty, acquired his first fortune which later became the famous Rothschild banking trust which is today worth several hundred trillion dollars. It is a far cry from the myths and legends that still surround the man who began as a rag and bone merchant and pawnbroker, working out of a small house on Judenstrasse, Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, where he lived with his wife and family. The events attributed to history are often caused by a &quot;hidden hand&quot; pulling the strings of kings, emperors, princes and potentates from behind the scenes. This phenomena is explained, and the legends that have grown up around the Rothschilds are demolished by this book that also reveals the RothschildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intriguing that brought down men like Napoleon and Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Legend has it that Mayer Amschel RothschildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;genius and financial skills&quot; were inherited by his sons, but the truth is quite a different story, as the author makes very clear in this well documented account that goes far beyond the best known legends cloaking the true character of the family. Exactly how Mayer Amschel Rothschild &quot;struck it lucky&quot; and the steps he took that brought the family from obscurity to &quot;virtual rulers of all Europe&quot;, makes fascinating reading. The Rothschild Dynasty is not only about the past, it is also about the present and the future. It will help to explain many of the events that perplex the ordinary people like the war in Iraq and the war threats against Iran. Find out the true story behind the biggest war profiteers in history and the hidden hand that controls them to this very day. 200 pages, some pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:132075289e8c75aade7eda514ff1b1fcb01921f8","amp;dn":"Coleman+-+The+Rothschild+Dynasty+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"132075289e8c75aade7eda514ff1b1fcb01921f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,32,117,40,158,140,117,170,222,126,218,81,79,241,177,252,176,25,33,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
