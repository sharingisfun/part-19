WHY DO I KEEP GETTING THE FEELING THAT YOU ARE PLAYING A JOKE ON EVERYONE AND, IF YOU ARE, HOW WOULD I KNOW?\r\n\r\nANSWER:* That is the funniest part of it. A joke can never be explained. Either you get it or you don't get it.\r\n\r\nQ:* COULD YOU GIVE ME SOME HELP?\r\n\r\nA:* That's the beauty of a joke.\r\n\r\nQ:* DOES THAT MEAN THAT IT IS A JOKE?\r\n\r\nA:* Everything is a joke, because to me life is not a serious affair. It is playfulness. It is fun. It is overflowing energy of existence -- for no reason, for no purpose. For no goal, for no end. Just for the sheer joy of it. This whole universe is just a big joke. That's why it cannot be explained....\r\nand more about children, weapon, swimming pool..\r\nText file is attached in folder\r\nPlease seed for some time, help to share free","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:385c220d4b7e949ef1ddc9dffd0acfd4992ead81","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Last+Testament_vol-3+%2327_everything+is+a+joke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"385c220d4b7e949ef1ddc9dffd0acfd4992ead81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,92,34,13,75,126,148,158,241,221,201,223,253,10,207,212,153,46,173,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
