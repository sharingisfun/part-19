Still had issues like glares, rgb problems missing footage and what not.\nThe DarkInnocence video was of a lower quailty both res and bitrate but did have the intro so we used this for that only.\nThe audio was some sweet line form our good friends TA :P\nWork done ...well first needed to cut the intro, almost 2mins off the darl inn cam and then needed to crop and resize it to match our main encode.\nOnce done it was onto the russian video this needed some TLC and we tried to balance the rgb colours out but in certian parts the colouring looks a little off but that due to the source changing colours slightly throughout.\nWe also lowered the glare as much as possible without it looking grey and washed out.Also messed with the brightness and contrast and used a smoother as well and a touch of sharpness.\nOh and also the first 14mins of the russian cam had some camera movements so there was black borders top and bottom, so we had to crop and resized that as well so AR might be slight off for that part.\nOnce both videos were done we muxed them together and then went onto syncing the line audio we had ....\n\nNow we have full line audio inc audio from before the film starts and until the very end and all that was missing is 26secs at the very begining...which at this point isn't on any other video so .....not alot we can do about that. Otherwise this is complete :)\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999 &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:082957018a262f026b2adee539adc8e302c20ec7","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Saga+Eclipse+TS+XViD+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"082957018a262f026b2adee539adc8e302c20ec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,41,87,1,138,38,47,2,107,42,222,229,57,173,200,227,2,194,14,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
