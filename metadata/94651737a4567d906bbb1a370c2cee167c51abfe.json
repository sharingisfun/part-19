Created by Masahiko Takajo and Saruwatari Tetsuya, the story is about a young man who has learned the art of Qigong from one of Chiang Kai Shek's bodyguards and has become so strong that he can literally punch a hole through people and solid objects. It was serialized in Business Jump from 1988 to 1990 and later published in 12 volumes.\n\nOutside Japan, it was translated and published only in Hong Kong by Comicsworld in nine volumes. The only difference between the two editions, besides the different number of pages in each volume, is the absence of the short story &quot;N.Y. Dust&quot;, which is unrelated to Riki-Oh, in the Hong Kong edition.\n\nThe manga, anime, and live-action film all contain gruesome, anatomically-correct graphic violence.\n\n\n1991\n\n01:28:30 Time\n\n720 x 480 Frame\n\nXvid Video Codec\nMP3 Lame Audio Codec\nAVI Container (695 MB)\n\nENGLISH DUB \n\n\n\nOMG SEED!
