Big Band - 1976 - Hello Rev\n\nAlthough a bit overlooked at the time (especially on the East Coast), Bill Berry's L.A. Big Band was one of the finest jazz orchestras of the mid- to late '70s. The all-star unit unfortunately recorded much too little, just one album for cornetist Berry's Beez label and this lone Concord set. The power and joyful swing of the all-star unit can certainly be heard on the latter, which was recorded at the 1976 Concord Jazz Festival. Solo space is allocated to Berry; trumpeters Jack Sheldon (who also sings &quot;Tulip or Turnip&quot;), Blue Mitchell, and Cat Anderson; trombonists Tricky Lofton, Jimmy Cleveland, and Britt Woodman; tenor saxophonists Richie Kamuca and Don Menza; and pianist Dave Frishberg, among others, and one should not overlook the lead alto work by Marshall Royal. This was certainly a remarkable unit. Berry modeled the band after Duke Ellington's and his rendition of &quot;Cotton Tail&quot; (with high note blasts in the &quot;background&quot; by Cat Anderson) is a classic. Highly recommended.
