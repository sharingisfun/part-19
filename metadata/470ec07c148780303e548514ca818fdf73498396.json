Generation Away (4:04)\n\nWhen Lady Antebellum was recording its fourth album, Golden, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to imagine someone saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Loosen up, will ya?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe group itself has admitted it was ready for a musical attitude adjustment after the string-heavy drama of 2011Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Own the Night. And for the most part, Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood succeeded in rolling up their sleeves and rolling down the car windows on Golden. \n\nStill, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tale of two albums. Despite the presence of utterly infectious single Ã¢â‚¬Å“DowntownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the jangly Ã¢â‚¬Å“Better Off Now That YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Gone,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the first half of Golden is a little too polished, as if the trio couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t escape the pull of Own the NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gravitas.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Get to MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lacks the oomph of an album opener, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Goodbye TownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reaches a wonderful whoa-oh-oh crescendo but, at nearly five minutes, takes too long to get there.\n\nEverything changes with the title track, however, a song that Stevie Nicks, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partner on CMT Crossroads, refers to as Lady AÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Landslide.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It could be; CharlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vulnerable vocal and its spare arrangement render it gorgeous.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Long Teenage Goodbye,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ meanwhile, is all summery innocence, a welcome breezy love song. And Ã¢â‚¬Å“All for Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ clichÃƒÂ© title aside, is a Hillary and Charles duet that soars.\n\nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one-two punch of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Better ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Generation AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that suggests Lady Antebellum is close to finding the secret for mixing easygoing music with evocative, mature lyrics. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical alchemy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470ec07c148780303e548514ca818fdf73498396","amp;dn":"Lady+Antebellum+-+Golden+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470ec07c148780303e548514ca818fdf73498396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,14,192,124,20,135,128,48,62,84,133,20,202,129,143,223,115,73,131,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
