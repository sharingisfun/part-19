For that purpose high schools, called Magic High Schools, \nwere nationally established. At First High School, the first of its kind, located in Hachiouji, Kanto, Tokyo, \nan elite school where the most excellent magicians are fostered; two hundred students are divided into\ntwo courses. With the students of Course 1 (called Bloom) excelling in magic, \nwhereas the Course 2 (called Weed) students are only seen as replacement for the former.\n\nIn the spring of the year 2095 two magicians enrol in First High School: Shiba Tatsuya, \nan honor student without magic capability, was barely accepted into Course 2, along with his sister, \nShiba Miyuki, who happens to be the top student among the freshmen in Course 1. \nIn this environment where students are divided into elites and plebs right at the enrollment, \ndiscrimination is running rampant. But what will happen to the irregular at Magic High School? \n\n\nSource: AniDB\n\n\n\nVideo: 848x480 MPEG-4 XviD (~966 kBit/s)\nAudio: Japanese 2.0 Stereo AAC (~1200 kBit/s)\nSubtitles: English Styled Soft-subs (ASS)\n\nOfficial Title: Ã©Â­â€Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã§Â§â€˜Ã©Â«ËœÃ¦Â Â¡Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¥Å Â£Ã§Â­â€°Ã§â€Å¸ The irregular at magic high school (Japanese)\n| The Irregular at Magic High School (Engllish) \nOriginal Work: Satou Tsutomu\nDirector: Ono Manabu \nProduction: Madhouse \n\nCategories: Action, Comedy, Magic, Romance, Science Fiction, Martial Arts, \nFantasy, Gainax Bounce, Novel, Seinen, School Life, High School \n\n\nMahÃ…ï¿½ka KÃ…ï¿½kÃ…ï¿½ no RettÃ…ï¿½sei | Mahouka [848x480 H264 AAC]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc2099f2ffb1db6c0940d15801faeed0f8c66ab","amp;dn":"Mah%C5%8Dka+K%C5%8Dk%C5%8D+no+Rett%C5%8Dsei+%7C+Mahouka+%5B848x480+H264+AAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc2099f2ffb1db6c0940d15801faeed0f8c66ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,194,9,159,47,251,29,182,192,148,13,21,128,31,174,237,15,140,102,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
