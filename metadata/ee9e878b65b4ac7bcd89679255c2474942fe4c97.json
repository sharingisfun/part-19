Looking back half a century into a very different world, Rumpole recalls a man accused of murdering his father and his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend with a pistol taken from a dead German pilot. It was this trial and its outcome that put Rumpole on the map and shaped him into the cantankerous defender of justice that readers know and love. This is a must-read for every Rumpole fan and a compelling invitation to new readers.\n\nSeries: Mystery Masters\nAudio CD: 1 pages\nPublisher: AudioGO; Unabridged edition (September 7, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1572704748\nISBN-13: 978-1572704749\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
