Nye Jr., \n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nYear: 1988\n\nWill the end of the Cold War bring peace and harmony or war and chaos?\n\nIs America going to play a dominant role in international affairs or is the U.S. in decline?\n\nIs military power still the key to world leadership or has economic power become more important?\n\nShould the U.S. attempt to play the role of global police force or should we withdraw from our overseas military commitments?\n\nProfessor Joseph S. Nye, Jr., the Dean of The Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, addresses these issues in this study of international politics.\n\nThis course examines the origins of the great conflicts of our century and asks if history is doomed to repeat them.\n\nTwice in the first half of this century, nearly all the great powers engaged in wars that killed nearly 70 million people. During the past 50 years, the Cold War has dominated our lives and international politics.\n\nThe aftermath of each war shook the international political system, changed the maps of the world, and set the scene for the next great conflict.\n\nThe series examines how concepts like the balance of power and the international system interweave with history. It asks what actually happened in these great conflicts, so we can better evaluate if we are destined to repeat them. \n\n8 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture\n\n1    Continuity and Change in World Politics \n2    What Is an International System? \n3    The Balance of Power and Its Problems \n4    The Origins of the First World War \n5    The Problems and Promise of Collective Security \n6    The Origins of the Second World War \n7    The Origins of the Cold War \n8    Alternatives to the Present International System ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbed5190e9df148f0ea463b02f7732d62cbf0673","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Must+History+Repeat+the+Great+Conflict+of+this+Century+%5B19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbed5190e9df148f0ea463b02f7732d62cbf0673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,237,81,144,233,223,20,143,14,164,99,176,47,119,50,214,44,191,6,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
