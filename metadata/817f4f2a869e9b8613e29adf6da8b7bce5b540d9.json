The album's domestic release was delayed partly due to the September 11 attacks, which occurred just two weeks before the intended release date. Milian decided not to release the album domestically; however, it was ultimately released three years later.\n\nMilian made her first professional musical appearance on Ja Rule's single &quot;Between Me And You&quot;, which led to a record deal with Def Jam and the release of her debut album. Production took place in Sweden, where Milian worked with several producers. It was during the production of the album that Milian first started to write songs, and received writing credit for nine tracks on the album. Milian was displeased by Def Jam's portrayal of her image, which she felt was constantly changing and confusing the audience.\n\nThe critical response to Christina Milian was mixed; critics who gave a positive review enjoyed the catchy tracks and lead single &quot;AM to PM&quot;, while others found that it needed original ideas. The album peaked at number 23 in the UK, selling a total of 101,986 copies and achieving Silver certification. The album spawned two singles, which charted worldwide. The track, &quot;Get Away&quot;, was supposed to the third single, but was not officially released.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Get Away\t\t\t- Featuring Ja Rule\n[02] AM To PM\n[03] When You Look At Me\n[04] Spending Time \t\t- Featuring Charli Baltimore\n[05] It Hurts When...\n[06] You Make Me Laugh\n[07] A Girl Like Me\t\t- Featuring Jermaine Dupri\n[08] Twitch\n[09] Until I Get Over You\n[10] Satisfaction Guaranteed\n[11] Got To Have You\n[12] Thank You\n[13] Your Last Call\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:51m:23s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 131mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi 200dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- R&amp;B Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 09 October 2001 [Europe]\n\nRecord Company\t\t- The Island Def Jam Music Group\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.christinamilian.org \n\t\t\t- \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/christinamilian\n\t\t\t- http://www.miliantalk.com/\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For The Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:817f4f2a869e9b8613e29adf6da8b7bce5b540d9","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Christina+Milian+-+Christina+Milian+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"817f4f2a869e9b8613e29adf6da8b7bce5b540d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,127,79,42,134,158,155,134,19,226,154,223,109,168,183,188,229,181,64,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
