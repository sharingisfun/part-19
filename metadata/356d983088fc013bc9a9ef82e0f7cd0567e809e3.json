This book is a collection of nearly 200 problems in geophysics, which are solved in detail showing each step of their solution, the equations used and the assumptions made. Simple figures are also included to help students understand how to reduce a problem to its key elements. The book introduces the equations most commonly used in solving geophysical problems, and presents a series of exercises for the main, classical areas of geophysics - gravity, geomagnetism, seismology, and heat flow and geochronology. Problems range from simple exercises for the most elementary courses to more complex problems suitable for graduate-level students. This handy book is the ideal adjunct to core course textbooks on geophysical theory. It is a convenient source of additional homework and exam questions for instructors, and provides students with a practice or revision aid.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 365 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (May 21, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1107602718\nISBN-13: 978-1107602717\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:356d983088fc013bc9a9ef82e0f7cd0567e809e3","amp;dn":"Solved+Problems+in+Geophysics+%282012%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"356d983088fc013bc9a9ef82e0f7cd0567e809e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,109,152,48,136,252,1,59,201,169,239,130,224,247,205,5,103,232,9,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
