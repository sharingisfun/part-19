In the meantime, the band went through some high-profile arguing as \nDavid Gahan turned into a long-haired, leather-clad rocker and pushed for a more \nguitar-oriented sound. Yet the odd thing about Songs of Faith and Devotion is \nthat it sounds pretty much like a Depeche Mode album, only with some new sonic \ntricks courtesy of Alan Wilder and co-producer Flood. Perhaps even odder is the \nfact that it works incredibly well all the same. &quot;I Feel You,&quot; opening with a \nscreech of feedback, works its live drums well, but when the heavy synth bass \nkicks in with the wailing backing vocals, even most rockers might find it hard \nto compete. Martin Gore's lyrical bent, as per the title, ponders relationships \nthrough distinctly religious imagery; while the gambit is hardly new, on songs \nlike the centerpiece &quot;In Your Room,&quot; the combination of personal and spiritual \nlove blends perfectly. Outside musicians appear for the first time, including \nfemale backing singers on a couple of tracks, most notably the gospel-flavored \n&quot;Condemnation&quot; and the uilleann pipes on &quot;Judas,&quot; providing a lovely intro to \nthe underrated song (later covered by Tricky). &quot;Rush&quot; is the biggest misstep, a \ntoo obvious sign that Nine Inch Nails was a recording-session favorite to unwind \nto. But with other numbers such as &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; and &quot;The Mercy in You&quot; \nto recommend it, Songs of Faith and Devotion continues the Depeche Mode winning \nstreak. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSongs of Faith and Devotion is the eighth studio album by Depeche Mode, first \nreleased in March 1993. The album incorporated more guitar textures than \nprevious releases. Upon its release, Songs of Faith and Devotion reached #1 in \nboth the UK and US album charts. The album was also the last one the band \nrecorded with Alan Wilder. To support the album, Depeche Mode embarked on the \neighteen-month Devotional Tour. As of April 2006, Songs of Faith and Devotion \nhas sold 920,000 units in the United States.\n\nAll art for the album was directed by Anton Corbijn, which included photography \nand the front cover. The front cover is the only Depeche Mode studio album cover \nto feature the band.\n\nIn 2006, Songs of Faith and Devotion was re-released with a bonus DVD. It was \nreleased as a part of the second wave of re-issues. (Along with A Broken Frame \nand Some Great Reward) The first CD was remastered and (except in the USA) was \nreleased on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes the B-Side &quot;My Joy&quot; along \nwith the Jazz Mix of &quot;Death's Door&quot; (similar to the original version) and \nseveral other remixes.\n\nAlso included was a 36 minute documentary on Songs of Faith and Devotion called \nDepeche Mode 91-94 (We Were Going To Live Together, Record Together And It Was \nGoing To Be Wonderful) named after a quote from Alan Wilder on the potential of \nliving in their Madrid-area recording studio. It features interviews with \nDepeche Mode (including Alan, who would leave the band shortly thereafter) and \nother important DM figures like Daniel Miller, Anton Corbijn and Daryl Bamonte. \nThere is also footage from the movie Devotional and the music videos. The \ndocumentary mainly focuses on the extreme difficulty of recording the album, and \nthe even more frustrating 14-month tour that followed.\n\nIt was released October 2, 2006 in the UK and October 3, 2006 in the US.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI FEEL YOU     by Tim DiGravina\n\nDepeche Mode settle into a storming, squalid rock swagger to open Songs of Faith \nand Devotion. &quot;I Feel You&quot; feels quite a bit like a sequel, at least musically \nand in tone, to Violator's &quot;Personal Jesus.&quot; The fuzzy, extreme guitar twang \nmight bring memories of that earlier song, but the vibe is more confessional and \nspiritual, at least on the surface. David Gahan almost screams Martin Gore's \nlyrics, venting as emotionally as if he's confessing his love to God in a \nchurch. Gahan's punchy inflection sits perfectly against the thunderous, fuzzy \nbuzz of electronics and guitar samples. The driving, throbbing beat invokes \nimagery of repetitive industrial manual labor, perhaps of workers pounding away \nin the blistering sun to build a railroad. If one was to take the album's title \nliterally, &quot;I Feel You&quot; would be a song of devotion, but it's delivered as if \nit's a song of faith. When he sings, &quot;This is the morning of our love, it's just \nthe dawning of our love,&quot; it's quite easy to mishear the vocals as &quot;this is the \nmorning of Allah, it's just the dawning of Allah.&quot; Depeche Mode always tie love \nand lust together with other feelings, whether religion, violence, or sorrow. \nThat &quot;I Feel You&quot; feels simultaneously like a religious song and a dark love \nsong is merely a testament to how powerful Gore is as a songwriter and how tight \nthe band was musically at this point, even as it collapsed internally. \n\n\nWALKING IN MY SHOES     by Tim DiGravina\n\nWith rampant depression, drug abuse, world tours with ridiculous schedules, and \ninterpersonal conflicts ravaging the members of Depeche Mode, walking in their \nshoes was the last thing anybody would hope for at this point in the band's \ncareer. But this darkly melodic and starkly revealing song from the great Songs \nof Faith and Devotion proves that even through obscene adversity, Martin Gore \nand company could achieve musical catharsis. Like &quot;I Feel You,&quot; &quot;Walking in My \nShoes&quot; feels like a throwback to Violator's lush electronic sweep. Even though \nit's musically quite ornate and smooth, Dave Gahan threatens to turn Gore's \nlyrics into a battle cry. Melodically, the song is similar to Ultra's &quot;Barrel of \na Gun,&quot; but where producer Tim Simenon would lead Depeche Mode down an \naggressive, bombastic path, Flood embellishes the band's sound with mournful, \nweeping synths. Of all the tracks on Songs of Faith and Devotion, &quot;Walking in My \nShoes&quot; shares perhaps the most in common musically with Depeche Mode's previous \nalbums. With so much of the album leaning toward spiritual revelation and \nhinting of gospel and blues, &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; strays the least from the \nband's formula of keyboards and depressed subject matter. That it feels like the \nband is recycling trademark sounds doesn't detract one bit from the song's power \nand swarthy charm. &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; is a sure highlight of Songs of Faith \nand Devotion even if it doesn't seek new ground thematically or musically. \n\n\n\nCONDEMNATION     by Tim DiGravina\n\nWith its handclap samples, heavenly background chorus, spiritual piano, and, of \ncourse, Dave Gahan's gut-wrenching vocals, &quot;Condemnation&quot; is the heart and soul \nof Songs of Faith and Devotion. Since the album's release, Depeche Mode has \ninexplicably expressed some disgust with the album as a final product and \nrevealed that &quot;Condemnation&quot; most matches the album's original thematic \nblueprint. The song certainly follows the album's title to a tee. Gahan \nabsolutely pours emotion from his larynx, his somewhat slurring vocals at once \nexpressing the rejuvenation of Martin Gore's lyrics and his own concurrent \nemotional and physical downfall. Gahan's constant plea of &quot;please open your \neyes&quot; as Gore moans ecstatically in the background captures a religious sense of \nrapture. Perhaps the most genre-bending Depeche Mode song in the band's first 20 \nyears, &quot;Condemnation&quot; is an honest, vibrant musical revelation. As great as the \nrest of the album is, one can only guess how fascinating Songs of Faith and \nDevotion would have been had Depeche Mode been able to come together as a unit \nto forge the masterpiece it had planned. As the band fell apart as a whole and \nas individuals, the result is still a fascinating and joyous journey, with \n&quot;Condemnation&quot; the hint and tip of the iceberg of what could have been. \n\n\n\nIN YOUR ROOM     by Tim DiGravina\n\n&quot;In Your Room&quot; is all about atmosphere. Dave Gahan sounds angry in his almost \nsinister vocal delivery, offering the album's least religious-oriented lyrics. \nNoirish keyboards, ominous industrial textures, a pounding mid-tempo beat, and a \nbizarre cut-and-paste moan sample provide a cinematic backdrop. Despite Gahan's \nserious tone, Gore's lyrics depict a masochistic demeanor. &quot;Will you leaving me \nlying here in your favorite darkness?&quot; Gahan wonders. He knows he's his lover's \n&quot;favorite passion, game, mirror, and slave.&quot; It's safe to say that &quot;In Your \nRoom&quot; is a kind of love song, but it's the morbid, diseased kind of love that \nperpetually fascinates Gore. Musically, the somewhat bland keyboards and string \narrangements don't conjure Depeche Mode's trademark mystery and power. \nUltimately, &quot;In Your Room&quot; feels like a moody experiment where the music can't \nquite match Gahan's fine vocals. That it's still a fine song and a favorite from \nthe album for some fans signals that even when Depeche Mode isn't firing on all \ncylinders, Gore's songwriting and Gahan's passion can still work considerable \nmagic. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT WIKIPEDIA\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI FEEL YOU\n\n&quot;I Feel You&quot; is Depeche Mode's twenty-seventh UK single, released on February \n15, 1993, and the first single for the then upcoming album Songs of Faith and \nDevotion. The song peaked at #8 on the UK singles chart and also made #1 and #3 \non the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart \nrespectively. It is the band's highest charting single worldwide.\n\n&quot;I Feel You&quot; brings Depeche Mode's rockier side to the table, using more non-\nelectronic instruments than ever before. For example, Alan Wilder plays drums, \nand Martin Gore plays the guitar, but there's still plenty of electronics, like \nthe synth screeching intro. Unlike most other pop and rock songs &quot;I Feel You&quot; \nsuperimposes a 6/8 beat (played by the guitar riff) into the 4/4 time, creating \nhemiola. The 7&quot; version of &quot;I Feel You&quot; is the same as the album version. The \n&quot;Throb Mix&quot; is a 12&quot; version, but with incomplete lyrics. A part of the mixes \nfrom the Limited Edition is used as an interlude on the Songs of Faith and \nDevotion album between &quot;Get Right With Me&quot; and &quot;Rush&quot;, and that same part is \nalso used for the intro in the Live versions as you can hear for example on the \nSongs of Faith and Devotion Live album.\n\nOn the cover of &quot;I Feel You&quot;, there are four symbols, each representing a \nmember. To tell which member it is, there's a number on the right-corner of each \nsymbol, which is that band member's birthdate OR you can match the symbols up \nwith the symbols on the Songs of Faith and Devotion cover, which overlap a \npicture of that band member. Using the latter, the top left corner is Alan \nWilder, the top right corner is David Gahan, the bottom left corner is Martin \nGore, and the bottom right corner is Andrew Fletcher.\n\nThe B-side is &quot;One Caress&quot;, which is a Martin vocal track from Songs of Faith \nand Devotion. In the USA, Sire / Reprise released &quot;One Caress&quot; as a promo-only \nsingle. One promo copy has the original version. The other has the version from \nSongs of Faith and Devotion Live. There is no remix for the song.\n\nThe music video for &quot;I Feel You&quot; is directed by Anton Corbijn. The girl in the \nvideo is English actress Lysette Anthony. There is also a music video for &quot;One \nCaress&quot;, it was directed by Kevin Kerslake and was filmed during one of the off\n-days of the Devotional Tour in the US. It was a promo-only video that was later \nreleased onThe Videos 86&gt;98. Prior to its inclusion on The Videos 86&gt;98, the \nmusic video for &quot;One Caress&quot; was frequently broadcast on MTV's Alternative Rock \nvideo block 120 Minutes.\n\nThe song is also used in a scene in Fatih Akin's Turkish-German film Gegen die \nWand.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWALKING IN MY SHOES\n\n&quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; is Depeche Mode's twenty-eighth UK single, released on \nApril 26, 1993, and the second single for the album Songs of Faith and Devotion. \nThe song reached #14 on the UK singles chart and matched the success of previous \nsingle &quot;I Feel You&quot; on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it hit #1.\n\nThe 7&quot; version of &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; is not the same as the one in the Songs \nof Faith and Devotion album. The sound has been made more noisy and dirty, \nespecially the drums in the verse, and the intro has been shortened.\n\nThe B-side is &quot;My Joy&quot;, the only exclusive B-Side from the Songs of Faith and \nDevotion album, and is a rock track in the vein of &quot;I Feel You&quot;.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; was directed by Anton Corbijn and is \nbased on Dante's Divine Comedy. At the beginning of the second verse, there's a \nshot of Martin Gore, Andrew Fletcher, and Alan Wilder with naked women on their \nlaps. This was removed in the MTV version in the US and replaced with footage \nthe three members standing still, alone, from earlier in the video. The uncut \nversion is on The Videos 86-98, the Devotional and The Best Of, Volume 1 DVDs. \nThe song was covered by Canadian Grunge Band, Finger Eleven and was placed on \ntheir 2000 album The Greyest of Blue Skies.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCONDEMNATION\n\n&quot;Condemnation&quot; is a song by Depeche Mode, released as the group's twenty-ninth \nUnited Kingdom single on September 13, 1993 (September 14 in the USA), and the \nthird single from their album Songs of Faith and Devotion. The song reached #9 \non the UK Singles Chart[1].\n\n&quot;Condemnation&quot; is a gospel-esque song with a rock twist. One of David Gahan's \nfavourite Depeche Mode songs, he always enjoys playing it live. He even did an \nacoustic version during some Exciter Tour concerts, because the song was not \nmeant to be played, but later on he really wanted to sing it. The 7&quot; version of \n&quot;Condemnation&quot; is the &quot;Paris Mix&quot;, because it's basically a re-recording of \n&quot;Condemnation&quot; done in Paris, with female backing vocals added and an emerging \ndrum beat scheme. Dave voted for &quot;Condemnation&quot; to be the first single for Songs \nof Faith and Devotion, but obviously lost.\n\nThe B-sides are remixes of &quot;Death's Door&quot; and &quot;Rush&quot;, and some live tracks from \nthe Devotional Tour. &quot;Death's Door&quot; was a song from the 1991 Until the End of \nthe World soundtrack. The original version is still exclusive to that CD, \nrecorded only by Martin Gore and Alan Wilder after the World Violation Tour was \nover.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Condemnation&quot; was directed by Anton Corbijn. For unknown \nreasons, it did not appear on The Videos 86-98 in 1998, replaced by the live \nversion from Devotional. The original video eventually resurfaced on The Videos \n86-98's 2002 re-release (The Videos 86-98+). Both videos appear on the \nDevotional DVD re-release in 2004. (Although the &quot;Condemnation Live&quot; video was \nedited so that it wasn't identical to the one in the main Devotional movie)\n\nThe video was shot in Hungary.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIN YOUR ROOM\n\n&quot;In Your Room&quot; is Depeche Mode's fourth and final single for the album Songs of \nFaith and Devotion, released on January 10, 1994 and January 18 in the USA. It \nreached #8 on the UK Singles Chart[1].\n\nThe common single version of &quot;In Your Room&quot;, the &quot;Zephyr Mix&quot;, is radically \ndifferent from the original version on the album. The music is completely redone \nby Butch Vig of Nirvana fame, with only Dave Gahan's vocals remaining unchanged. \nOther official single remixes include the &quot;Apex Mix&quot;, produced by Brian Eno, \nwhich sounds closer to the album version and Johnny Dollar's &quot;The Jeep Rock \nMix&quot;, which appears on Remixes 81 - 04.\n\nDuring concerts in 1993 and early 1994, the album version was played live. From \nthe 1998 Singles Tour onwards, the &quot;Zephyr Mix&quot; of the song has been played live \ninstead. However, in Tour of the Universe a mixture of both versions is played \nlive.\n\nThe single was released in a special foldout digipak with room to hold three \ndifferent versions of the &quot;In Your Room&quot; single: the original release \n(CDBong24), a live disc (LCDBong24) and a remix disc (XLCDBong24). The b-sides \nconsist of a remix of album track &quot;Higher Love&quot;, along with some live songs from \nthe Devotional Tour.\n\nIn 2003, Fallon Bowman's band, Amphibious Assault, covered the song for their \ndebut LP District Six.\n\nThe music video for &quot;In Your Room&quot; was directed by Anton Corbijn and features \nreferences to the &quot;Strangelove&quot; (a model posing in her underwear), &quot;I Feel You&quot; \n(a woman dressed as Dave Gahan, wearing a pinstripe suit, sunglasses, and a \nwig), &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; (the bird costume), &quot;Halo&quot; (the people wearing clown \nmakeup), &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; (Dave Gahan dressed as a king, holding the folding \nchair while walking in the road), &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; (the bandmembers wearing \ncowboy hats), and &quot;Condemnation&quot; (the white dress with ribbons on it that one of \nthe women wears) videos. Corbijn described the video as a retrospective at the \nwork he had done with Depeche Mode. He said he made it that way because he was \nsure frontman Dave Gahan was going to die before Depeche Mode could release more \nsongs.\n\nThe video features Alexandra Kummer, who sometimes is partially clothed. Because \nof the partial nudity and scenes of bondage the video only aired after prime \ntime on MTV in the US. Since the video had only limited screen play the single \nwas not a hit in the USA.\n\nThis is the last Depeche Mode single with Alan Wilder as a band member, and thus \nthe last music video he appears in.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.
