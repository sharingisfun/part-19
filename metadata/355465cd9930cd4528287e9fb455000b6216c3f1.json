Gable stars as Gay Langland, an aging hand traveling the byways and working at rodeos with his two comrades, Guido (Eli Wallach) and young Perce Howland (Montgomery Clift). The three men come up with a plan to corral some misfit mustangs and sell them for dog food, but Gay's new girlfriend Roslyn Taber (Marilyn Monroe), a high-minded ex-stripper who has just divorced her husband Ray (Kevin McCarthy) in Reno, is appalled by the plan. Although both Guido and Perce are also in love with Roslyn, she stands by Gay, sure that in the end he will do the right thing, even as he and his pals begin their planned roundup.\n\nFile Name .........................................: The Misfits.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,816,580,096 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:05:02\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 632x384 (AR: 1.646)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1735 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.298 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055184/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055184/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese (srt)\n\nMy rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:355465cd9930cd4528287e9fb455000b6216c3f1","amp;dn":"John+Huston+-+The+Misfits+%281961%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"355465cd9930cd4528287e9fb455000b6216c3f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,84,101,205,153,48,205,69,40,40,126,159,180,85,0,11,98,22,195,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
