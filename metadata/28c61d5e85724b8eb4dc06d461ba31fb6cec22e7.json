Do we have a soul? Is it possible to make contact with a spiritual realm? How should we respond to the divine? Will life continue beyond death?\nWhether you are a deeply religious person, a spiritual seeker, or one who has come to doubt or disbelieve in a spiritual power, you have probably pondered these questions and at least begun to answer them for yourself. In fact, archaeological and historical records show that even the earliest humans were aware of a spiritual realm and developed religious practices as a result.\n\nOne of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most awesome forces, the spread and practice of religion has exerted a profoundly outsized effect on individuals and entire civilizations, altering the course of history. The religious impulse is so powerfully pervasive that neuroscience has posed a provocative question: Are our brains wired to worship?\n\nIn The Spiritual Brain: Science and Religious Experience, award-winning scholar and practicing neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Newberg, Director of Research at the Myrna Brind Center of Integrative Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, offers you 24 riveting lectures that explore the new and exciting field of neurotheology, a discipline aimed at understanding the connections between our brains and different kinds of religious phenomena. Using an academic, experimental approach into what he calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“objective measures of spirituality,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dr. Newberg attempts to explain what others have previously only guessed at: the neuroscientific basis for why religion and spirituality have played such a prominent role in human life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c61d5e85724b8eb4dc06d461ba31fb6cec22e7","amp;dn":"TTC+-+The+Spiritual+Brain+-+Science+and+Religious+Experience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c61d5e85724b8eb4dc06d461ba31fb6cec22e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,198,29,94,133,114,75,142,180,220,6,212,97,186,49,251,108,236,34,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
