Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nA short version of Wink's &quot;Powers&quot; trilogy. It's difficult to summarize Wink's approach in this book, but it involves reconceiving traditional biblical language in ways that simultaneously remove it from the realms of superstition and Western rationalist theology, while taking into account sources as diverse as Carl Jung and the politics of radical nonviolence. A must-read.\n\nBack cover:\n\nIn The Powers That Be, renowned theologian and biblical scholar Walter Wink helps us reformulate our ancient religious concepts - such as God and Satan, angels and demons, principalities and powers - in light of what we now know. Wink's theology is shaped as much by his study of the Bible as by his involvement in the civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid in South Africa.\n\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Perhaps we are not accustomed to thinking of the Pentagon, or the Chrysler Corporation, or the Mafia as having a spirituality, but they do,&quot; writes Walter Wink. In The Powers That Be: Theology for a New Millennium, Wink returns to the ancient view of a world filled with angels and demons, powers and principalities, and reinterprets these notions for contemporary people. Wink's book is a challenge for Christians to wake up and become dangerously different, by objecting to the Darwinian games of domination that prevail in many of our governments, corporations, and churches. The book also offers stunningly gracious comfort, by showing that we are all caught up in this game, that the game is even a part of our gift, and that as long as we live in the world, not a single one of us can be pure, but we're called, all of us, to be holy.\n\n\n\nThe Powers That Be reclaims the divine realm as central to human existence by offering new ways of understanding our world in theological terms. Walter Wink reformulates ancient concepts, such as God and the devil, heaven and hell, angels and demons, principalities and powers, in light of our modern experience. He helps us see heaven and hell, sin and salvation, and the powers that shape our lives as tangible parts of our day-to-day experience, rather than as mysterious phantoms. Based on his reading of the Bible and analysis of the world around him, Wink creates a whole new language for talking about and to God. Equipped with this fresh world view, we can embark on a new relationship with God and our world into the next millennium.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:902ec7bfe78c721496cc05d2e6ebddae19441d87","amp;dn":"Walter+Wink+-+The+Powers+That+Be%2C+Theology+for+the+New+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"902ec7bfe78c721496cc05d2e6ebddae19441d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,46,199,191,231,140,114,20,150,204,5,210,230,235,221,174,25,68,29,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
