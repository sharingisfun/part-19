Since 20-bit and 24-bit remastering have become the norm, however, the only challenge for Sanctuary Records (or the Sequel and Castle Records imprints) seems to be how inexpensive they can make the group's U.K. CDs, and also how many different reissues and compilations they can get out on the group's Pye Records library of around 100 songs -- after all, this three-CD set is at least the second triple-decker career survey of the group put out by the label since the 1980s. And the Liverpool-based band is threatening to pass the Who in terms of the sheer number of reissues and compilations of their work, which is amazing when you consider that the Searchers last charted a single about 38 years previously -- to be sure, they've been adding many good and some great songs to their catalog in the decades since, but no hits as such. This set is nicely comprehensive at 75 songs, limited as it is to finished masters and official releases -- there are no vault finds here such as the Iron Door Sessions tracks or live radio recordings, just singles, B-sides, EP tracks, and LP tracks covering four years in their history, all sounding excellent and in stereo wherever they were mastered that way.\n\nIn effect, this is a more expansive companion (or alternative) to the 2003-released 40th Anniversary double-CD set, with more attention paid to the overview than to the placement of individual songs -- ...\n\nThe entire review at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:knfrxqealdte~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:knfrxqealdte~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
