You can really here the compressor sucking it down. This is not for dynamic range audiophiles. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then it's likely that this version will sound 'better' to you.\n\nAlso, the original was 128kbps and I have encoded here at 192kbps CBR. 160 would have sufficed. I wasn't thinking of distribution at the time, and I don't feel like doing it again.\n\nThanks once again to the Frames for the music!!, and to npr for recording the show.\n\n\nThe Orginal Audio can be downloaded here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9796328&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9796328&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor indeed here by torrent, (it's the original audio):\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4174702\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1989933ede850b7894151fb533295cf340f4b027","amp;dn":"The+Frames%2C+NPR+All+Songs+Considered+26-04-07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1989933ede850b7894151fb533295cf340f4b027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,137,147,62,222,133,11,120,148,21,31,181,51,41,92,243,64,244,176,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
