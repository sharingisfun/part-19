Night Shyamalan,&quot; but we feel itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s safe to say that this one came straight from his colon. What is there to say about The Last Airbender that isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t already said by its Rotten Tomatoes rating of 6%? A whole lot, as it turns out. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s becoming apparent that the true genius of M. Night is finding a way to make the wrong creative decision at any given moment. Dialogue, casting, music cues, every choice in the film suggests that the once-acclaimed director has given up Alfred Hitchcock as his inspiration, and replaced him with a certain T. Wiseau. And, frankly, we couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be happier. But, Mr. Shyamalan: we worked with Tommy Wiseau, we know Tommy Wiseau, and you, sir, are no Tommy Wiseau.\n\nJoin Mike, Kevin, and Bill for The Last Airbender, the most disappointing adaptation of a beloved franchise since Mario Brothers 3: Luigi Buys Some Eggs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09df65fd60163481360ba36f90d8071bc1fca2c6","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+The+Last+Airbender+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09df65fd60163481360ba36f90d8071bc1fca2c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,223,101,253,96,22,52,129,54,11,163,111,144,216,7,27,193,252,162,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
