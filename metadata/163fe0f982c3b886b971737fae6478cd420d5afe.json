With Sonny Bono enlisted as producer, Cher lit up the pop charts with the smash &quot;All I Really Want to Do,&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;I Go to Sleep.&quot; Although the next three years saw only inconsistent chart entries, her recordings were interesting and frequently as good as the leading lights of folk-pop, the Mamas &amp; the Papas. And she covered most of the best folk songwriters of the time -- Dylan, Tim Hardin, John Sebastian, Paul Simon, and Jackie DeShannon. Add points for a few interesting crossovers of pop songs like &quot;Sunny&quot; or &quot;Alfie&quot; (the latter a Top 40 hit), but subtract some for a few misguided covers (&quot;It's Not Unusual&quot; prime among them), and The Best of the Imperial Recordings 1965-1968 is revealed as a near-necessity for '60s folk-rock fans. It includes all of her album debut, All I Really Want to Do, as well as the vast majority of her four subsequent LPs for the label (The Sonny Side of Cher, Cher, With Love, Cher, Backstage).
