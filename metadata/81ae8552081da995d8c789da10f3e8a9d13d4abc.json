It ran for six issues, beginning in 1950.  Its artists included Murphy Anderson, Bernard Krigstein, and Don Perlin, and at least one issue (#2) featured a cover painting by Alex Schomburg.\n\n\nMarvel Comics: 1961 series\nMarvel's first series of this title premiered June 1961, and featured primarily science fiction and drive-in movie-style monster stories, virtually all drawn by the legendary comics artists Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko. Notably, its first issue introduced the supernatural monster-hunter Doctor Droom, Marvel's first Silver Age of Comic Books superhero.  He resurfaced in the 1970s as Doctor Druid, having been renamed to avoid confusion with Doctor Doom. \nAmazing Adventures #3 (cover-dated Aug. 1961, published May 9, 1961 per the Library of Congress) was the first comic book labeled Marvel Comics, with a small &quot;MC&quot; box added to the cover.\nThe series was retitled and reformatted as Amazing Adult Fantasy with #7.  With issue #15 (Aug. 1962) Amazing Adult Fantasy was renamed Amazing Fantasy, which featured the first appearance of Spider-Man.\n\n\nMarvel Comics: 1970s series\nMarvel's next Amazing Adventures was a split title featuring the Inhumans  (initially both written and drawn by Jack Kirby) and The Black Widow (initially by writer  Gary Friedrich and penciler John Buscema). The Widow was dropped after vol.. 2, #8, and full-length Inhumans stories ran for two issues before that feature, too, was dropped.\nVol. 2, #11 (March 1972) introduced solo stories of erstwhile X-Men member the Beast, in which he was mutated into his modern-day blue-furred (originally grey-furred) form. The initial story was by writer Gerry Conway, penciler Tom Sutton, and inker Syd Shores. The Beast's supporting cast included Patsy Walker and her ex-husband, &quot;Buzz&quot; Baxter, who much later became the supervillain  Mad-Dog. \nThe title introduced the series &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and its central character, Killraven, in vol. 2, #18 (May 1973). Created by co-plotters Roy Thomas and Neal Adams, scripter Conway, and pencilers Adams and Howard Chaykin, it was taken over by writer Don McGregor for an acclaimed run from vol. 2, #21 (Nov. 1973) to the final issue, vol. 2, #39 (Nov. 1976). Pencillers were Herb Trimpe, Rich Buckler, Gene Colan, and, most notably, P. Craig Russell from vol. 2, #27.\n\n\nMarvel Comics: 1979 series\nVolume 3 reprinted [Uncanny] X-Men #1-8, the first six issues of which were split into two-part stories. The backup feature was &quot;Origin of the X-Men&quot; from X-Men #38-48, except in Amazing Adventures vol. 3, #12, in which the incongruous backup was an 11-page, Jim Steranko &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; story, &quot;Today Earth Died&quot;, from Strange Tales #168 (May 1968).\nEight covers of this 1979 series were reprints of the Jack Kirby originals; artists for the rest included penciler John Byrne on vol. 2, #6 and #9.\n\n\nAmazing High Adventure\nAmazing High Adventure was a sporadically published anthology of historical, biblical and science-fiction adventure stories from 1984 to 1986. Like the 1950s Ziff-Davis Amazing Adventures, it, too, featured painted covers, with the artists including Joe Chiodo, Frank Cirocco, Dan Green, and John Bolton. A one-shot Amazing Adventures (July 1988) was similar.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ae8552081da995d8c789da10f3e8a9d13d4abc","amp;dn":"Amazing+Adventures+%28Ziff-Davis+and+Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ae8552081da995d8c789da10f3e8a9d13d4abc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,174,133,82,8,29,169,149,216,199,137,218,16,243,232,169,209,61,74,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
