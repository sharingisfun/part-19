A remarkably expressive and intimate record, it's a work of consummate craftsmanship. Always a superior pop composer, King reaches even greater heights as a performer; new songs like the hits &quot;It's Too Late&quot; and &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; rank solidly with past glories, while songs like &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; take on added resonance when delivered in her own warm, compelling voice. With its reliance on pianos and gentle drumming, Tapestry is a light and airy work on its surface, occasionally skirting the boundaries of jazz, but it's also an intensely emotional record, the songs confessional and direct; in its time it connected with listeners like few records before it, and it remains an illuminating experience decades later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08109b1f673ecaf3bcea950cbc71241ade1eef21","amp;dn":"Carole+King+-+Tapestry+%281971%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08109b1f673ecaf3bcea950cbc71241ade1eef21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,16,155,31,103,62,202,243,188,234,149,12,188,113,36,26,222,30,239,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
