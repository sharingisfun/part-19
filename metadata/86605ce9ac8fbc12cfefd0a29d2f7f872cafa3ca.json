Linda Ronstadt has recorded a number of her songs, notably three tracks on the 1976 album Hasten Down the Wind Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Someone To Lay Down Beside Me&quot;, &quot;Lose Again&quot; and &quot;If He's Ever Near&quot;, which introduced the then-unknown Bonoff to a mass audience.\nIn her early career, Bonoff sang background vocals for Ronstadt and Wendy Waldman before releasing her debut album in 1977, titled Karla Bonoff. Her other albums include Restless Nights (1979), Wild Heart of the Young (1982), New World (1988) and All My Life (a greatest hits collection) in 1999. Bonoff is best known as a songwriter, but she is also noted for her hit recording of &quot;Personally&quot;, which became a #19 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as #3 on the Adult Contemporary chart in the summer of 1982. She also recorded &quot;Somebody's Eyes&quot; for the Footloose (1984) soundtrack and &quot;Standing Right Next To Me&quot; on the 8 Seconds (1994) soundtrack.\nBonoff's first live album was released in September 2007. This double CD includes many of her best-known songs performed live in concert on October 24, 2004 in Santa Barbara, California (except for one song recorded July 30, 2005 in Japan). She is backed by her touring band, which includes the now deceased Kenny Edwards (guitar, bass, mandolin, cello, vocals) and Nina Gerber (guitar) plus long-time associate Scott Babcock (drums and vocals).\n\nShe is also a member of the currently inactive group Bryndle, which includes Wendy Waldman and the late Kenny Edwards (Edwards also produced Bonoff's first three albums). The band has also included Andrew Gold, who left the band in 1996. The group first formed in the late 1960s, but did not release any albums until twenty years later with two studio albums and a live album between 1995 and 2002.\nBonoff continues to tour throughout America and Japan.\n\nAlbums included:\nKarla Bonoff (1977) \nRestless Nights (1979)\nWild Heart of the Young (1982)\nNew World (1988)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86605ce9ac8fbc12cfefd0a29d2f7f872cafa3ca","amp;dn":"Karla+Bonoff+-+Studio+Discography+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86605ce9ac8fbc12cfefd0a29d2f7f872cafa3ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,96,92,233,172,143,188,18,207,239,208,162,157,47,127,135,44,175,163,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
