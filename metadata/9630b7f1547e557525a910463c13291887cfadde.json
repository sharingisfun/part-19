It includes English subtitles,\ncommentary tracks, and scans of the packaging, DVDs and booklet.  See the\nbooklet scans for further details on what Metrodome included in the collection.\nEach episode has an avi with the video and Japanese audio. The subs and\ncommentary are a separate srt and mp3.\n\nUse VideoLAN, Media Player Classic, or any other media player capable of merging\naudio tracks and subtitles during playback.  The files are released in this\nformat to give the viewer the greatest flexibility in choosing their preferred\nplayback experience.\n\n\nBackground:\nAlthough nominally occurring in the same continuity as the previous Transformers\nseries, there was a very obvious effort on head writer Masumi Kaneda's part to\nmake Masterforce a &quot;fresh start&quot;, introducing an entirely new cast of characters\nfrom scratch, rather than using any of the previous ones. To this end, although\nthe toys are mostly the same in both Japan and the West (barring some different\ncolor schemes), the characters which they represent are vastly different - most\nprominently, the toy known to Western audiences as Powermaster Optimus Prime is\nknown as Ginrai in Masterforce, a human trucker who combines with a Transtector\n(a non-sentient Transformer body, a concept lifted from Headmasters) to become\na Transformer himself. The other Powermaster toys (known in Japan as Godmasters)\nand the Headmaster figures released during that year were the same: human beings\nwho become robots.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9630b7f1547e557525a910463c13291887cfadde","amp;dn":"Transformers.Masterforce.1988.DVDRip.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9630b7f1547e557525a910463c13291887cfadde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,48,183,241,84,126,85,117,37,169,16,70,60,19,41,24,135,207,173,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
