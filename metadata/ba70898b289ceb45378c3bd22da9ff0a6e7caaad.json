But don't let that put you off. Despite the subject matter - the lives of five strippers who work in the eponymous club (played by Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly, Sheila Kelley, Charlotte Ayanna and Sandra Oh) - and the frequent nudity, Blue Iguana is not a T&amp;A movie. Rather, it's a compelling insight into the lives of the underclass of Los Angeles, or indeed, any one of the world's major cities.\n\nIf your cinematic tastes run to tightly plotted fare where all the loose ends are tied up with a big gift-wrap bow in the last five minutes, you'll probably it find frustrating. But if you can appreciate a film in which some issues are never quite resolved and some questions are never quite answered - just like real life - then you may be seduced by the Blue Iguana.\n\nThe film has been panned by so many critics that I must admit I started watching the DVD with some trepidation, expecting to be embarrassed for the actors. But I became so engrossed in the world of the Blue Iguana that I was actually disappointed when the film ended.\n\nMuch of the criticism of Blue Iguana is based on the fact that it was made without a script. The actors started with only two things: the title of the film and the fact that it was set in a strip club. Everything else, they worked out themselves - their characters, their storylines, and their dialogue - in an intense series of improvisational workshops. This approach may be unconventional, but it gives Blue Iguana a freshness and immediacy which is rarely found in mainstream films. As Michael Radford explains in the director's commentary, improv relies on nailing the scene in the first take; once it becomes too polished, it loses its sense of realism.\n\nThe female cast has been another target for critics - not because they're not superb actors, but because, in their late 30's to early 40s, Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly and Sheila Kelley would be too old to work as strippers in LA where beautiful young women exist in a buyer's market. But they bring a depth of sadness to their characters - you can't help wondering where they'll be a few years down the track.\n\nSandra Oh's performance as Jasmine is a standout. Jasmine leads a double life, stripping on the Blue Iguana stage and secretly writing poetry in the dressing room. After persuading her to read one of her painfully beautiful works at his poetry group Dennis (Chris Hogan) starts to fall in love with her mind. But Jasmine realises the fledgling romance is doomed. In the film's most heartbreaking scene, when Dennis seeks her out at the club, she performs her routine to Moby's &quot;Porcelain&quot; with its haunting refrain &quot;So This is Goodbye&quot;. The camera focuses on her face. It's an impassive mask, but her eyes betray incredible sadness. She's wordlessly saying to him, &quot;This is the real me. Do you still want me now?&quot;\n\nPutting aside its improv-based development, Blue Iguana succeeds on its own merits. If you want to see a T&amp;A film, rent a copy of Showgirls. If you want to see a haunting, thought-provoking slice of life, get hold of the DVD of Dancing at the Blue Iguana. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img353.imageshack.us/img353/3456/grab15226bb1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img353.imageshack.us/img353/3456/grab15226bb1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img83.imageshack.us/img83/7810/grab40197yk7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img83.imageshack.us/img83/7810/grab40197yk7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img212.imageshack.us/img212/9086/grab59966yu6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img212.imageshack.us/img212/9086/grab59966yu6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img83.imageshack.us/img83/560/grab69192yu4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img83.imageshack.us/img83/560/grab69192yu4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----not my rip------\n\n~~~~~~ Dancing at the Blue Iguana.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,461,698,560                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD Dev ver. 25-Mar-03              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:03:35                \nFrame Count:....................................177774             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................576                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................304                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.895                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1183                 \n......MPEG-4..............................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.282&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................384                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................6           \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba70898b289ceb45378c3bd22da9ff0a6e7caaad","amp;dn":"Michael+Radford+-+Dancing+at+the+Blue+Iguana+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba70898b289ceb45378c3bd22da9ff0a6e7caaad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,112,137,139,40,156,235,69,55,140,59,210,45,169,255,10,110,124,170,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
