Now Goodkind returns with a new novel of Richard and Kahlan, the beginning of a sequence of three novels that will bring their epic story to its culmination.\n\nAfter being gravely injured in battle, Richard awakes to discover Kahlan missing. To his disbelief, no one remembers the woman he is frantically trying to find. Worse, no one believes that she really exists, or that he was ever married. Alone as never before, he must find the woman he loves more than life itself....if she is even still alive. If she was ever even real.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f457e95c4acba58eb0dd0083168e62cc0abde41","amp;dn":"Chainfire+%28Sword+of+Truth%2C+%239%29+-+Terry+Goodkind.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f457e95c4acba58eb0dd0083168e62cc0abde41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,69,126,149,196,172,186,88,235,13,208,8,49,104,230,44,192,171,222,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
