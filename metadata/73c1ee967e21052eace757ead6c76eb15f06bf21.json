In combination with .NET, F# achieves unrivaled levels of programmer productivity and program clarity.\n\nExpert F# 3.0 is:\n- A comprehensive guide to F# by the inventor of F#\n- A treasury of F# techniques for practical problem-solving\n- An in-depth case book of how F# applications and of F# 3.0 concepts, syntax, and features\n\nF# isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just another functional programming language. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a general-purpose language ideal for solving real-world development problems. F# seamlessly integrates functional, imperative, object-oriented and query programming styles so you can flexibly and elegantly solve any programming problem. F# 3.0 combines this with the seamless data-integration capabilities of F# Information-Rich Programming. Whatever your background, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find that F# is easy to learn, fun to use, and extraordinarily powerful. F# will change the way you think aboutÃ¢â‚¬â€and go aboutÃ¢â‚¬â€programming.\n\nWritten by F#Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s inventor and two major F# community members, Expert F# 3.0 is a comprehensive and in-depth guide to the language and its use. Designed to help others become experts, the book quickly yet carefully describes the paradigms supported by F# language, and then shows how to use F# elegantly for a practical web, data, parallel and analytical programming tasks.\n\nThe worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experts in F# show you how to program in F# the way they do!\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- Explore F# and its features quickly and thoroughly in the introductory chapters\n- Use F# with matching technologies including SQL, LINQ, ASP.NET and REST\n- Build reactive, asynchronous, and distributed web applications with F#\n- Interoperate with F# from other languages, especially C#\n- Integrate data sources and services using F# 3.0 Information-Rich Programming\n- Test, profile, and performance tune F# applications\n- Create mobile applications, both web and native\n\nWho this book is for\nExpert F# 3.0 is for anyone interested in state-of-the-art programming for solving real-world problems. Programmers of all backgrounds will find it engrossing. For C#, Java and VB programmers, F# provides invaluable insights into the future of these languages. For lovers of Python, Ruby and other dynamic languages, F# shows how you can get most of the benefits of these languages while keeping strong types and good performance. For educators, F# is the answer to a decades-long prayer: a language based on strong computer science concepts that also excites and empowers, not just in the classroom, but also in the real world.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
