And though the 12-step program by itself can often bring initial success, many addicts find themselves relapsing back into old ways and old patterns, or replacing one addiction with another. Author Darren Littlejohn has been there and back, and presents a complimentary guide for recovery to the traditional twelve-step program, out of his own struggles and successes through the study of Zen and Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nAuthor: Darren Littlejohn \n\nPublisher: Atria Books/Beyond Words\n\nYear released: 10 Mar 2009\n\nGenre: Non fiction/Buddhism\n\nFormat: azw3 &amp; epub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97768d256e1b08d8603d006f43c25d10f5c84e26","amp;dn":"The+12-Step+Buddhist+-+Darren+Littlejohn+ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97768d256e1b08d8603d006f43c25d10f5c84e26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,118,141,37,110,27,8,216,96,61,0,111,67,194,93,16,245,200,78,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
