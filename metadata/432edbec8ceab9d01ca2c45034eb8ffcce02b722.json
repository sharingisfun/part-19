During the British blues boom of 1968-1969, they decided to form a &quot;straight blues&quot; group, recruiting prospective members from the classified pages of Melody Maker. Joining them were piano player Lou Martin, bassist Stuart MacDonald, and drummer Bazz Smith. Taking their name from Howlin' Wolf's &quot;Killing Floor&quot; (Wolf's cover was itself a version of Robert Johnson's &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;), the band played just one gig before ex-Radio Caroline DJ and ardent blues fanatic John Edward offered to manage them. Edward's connection with the Southern Music publishing company led to them signing with Southern's Spark Records imprint. The band was booked into Pye Recording Studios and with Edward aboard as &quot;producer,&quot; they recorded their self-titled debut in 12 days' time. Most of the material was re-configured Chicago blues classics, except for a cover of Willie Dixon's &quot;You Need Love.&quot; Killing Floor was released in the U.S. on new London subsidary Sire. Meanwhile, Edward booked the band gigs at Dunstable's California Ballroom, where they supported Ten Years After, Jethro Tull, Chicken Shack, and the Herd, to name a few. He also helped them get gigs at the Marquee, where they supported Yes and the Nice, and in 1969, they also toured with Texas bluesman Freddy King on two U.K. tours, which helped further their growing reputation. The band also appeared on all the contemporary British radio rock shows and toured solidly around the U.K. Lou Martin left after the release of Killing Floor and a handful of BBC Radio sessions and the group continued as a four-piece band. There were additional lineup changes in 1970-1971, at which point the group included ex-Juicy Lucy vocalist Ray Owen, drummer Rod D'Ath, and bassist Mick Hawksworth (ex-Fuzzy Duck/Andromeda/Ten Years Later). A second Killing Floor album, Out of Uranus, was released in 1971 on Penny Farthing Records, this time with executive producer/label honcho and the Troggs' manager Larry Page overseeing the sessions. By mid-1972, Killing Floor had disbanded. The various members became Toe Fat and began backing Cliff Bennett. Thorndycraft retired from music and Bazz Smith continued to play in jazz trios. McDonald formed a band called Peace (with ex-Free vocalist Paul Rodgers) before returning to his native Wales and playing in local bands. Former piano player Martin joined Rory Gallagher's band, toured with Chuck Berry, and later played with Blues 'N' Trouble. In 1974, guitarist Mick Clarke formed legendary pub rockers S.A.L.T. with &quot;Little&quot; Stevie Smith. In 1983, he had his own group, the Mick Clarke Band, who have released numerous LPs. Both Killing Floor albums have been reissued by Repertoire Records and See for Miles (the first album was retitled Rock the Blues).\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bryan Thomas , All Music Guide \n\n\nThis reissued debut LP by Killing Floor (Originally released on the Sire label with a blood covered jail cell on the cover) is laden with imposing blues-rock by the 60's British blues band. They took blues legends' influences and changed it to reflect our times much in the same way Hendrix and so many other bands did. By electrifying the blues, the music reached a young audience that was changing dramatically. The new sounds featured hard rocking long guitar solos that appealed to a young audience hungry for something different.\n\nBy supporting groups like Ten Years After and Jethro Tull on tour, this band received some attention and notoriety, nothing like the bands that they opened for, but they did make a name for themselves. This self-titled debut burns with the red-hot coals of emotion only found in righteous blues music. All but one of these tracks is an original, which proves that they were talented enough to hold their own. Singer and harp player Bill Thorndycraft had a gruff deep down-from-the-belly vocal style, similar to Alvin Lee, and he could blow the harp to give the music that earthy blues feeling that could be found in all the Mississippi Delta acoustic blues. Michael Clark was an exceptional six-string slinger that had a fire burning in his belly; you could hear it in his playing, and the rhythm section of Bas Smith (drums) and Stuart MacDonald (bass) was steadfast and true in support of his fire branded flourishes. Lou Martin added the additional elements of keyboards to give their music more texture and a modern updated sound.\n\nThis is an excellent album for a debut, and they clearly broke some ground like their counterparts the Groundhogs did during the same timeframe. This LP has an unfailing flow and liveliness that never lets up; its all mighty blues-rock played with heart and soul.\n\nKeith &quot;MuzikMan&quot; Hannaleck\n\n\n\n        1.\tWoman You Need Love\n\t2.\tNobody By My Side\n\t3.\tCome Home Baby\n\t4.\tBedtime Blues\n\t5.\tSunday Morning\n\t6.\tTry To Understand\n\t7.\tMy Mind Can Ride Easy\n\t8.\tWet\n\t9.\tKeep On Walking\n\t10.\tForget It!\n\t11.\tLou's Blues\n\t12.\tPeople Change Your Mind\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:432edbec8ceab9d01ca2c45034eb8ffcce02b722","amp;dn":"Killing+Floor-Killing+Floor%281969%29%282007+Repertoire+Rem.%29%5BEAC-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"432edbec8ceab9d01ca2c45034eb8ffcce02b722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,46,219,236,140,234,185,208,28,162,196,80,52,235,143,252,206,2,183,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
