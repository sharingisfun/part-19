It ended in March/April 2014.\n\nIn this course, students learn to recognize and to apply the basic concepts that govern integrated body function (as an intact organism) in the body's nine organ systems.\n\nThe goal of this course is to provide an introduction to human physiology. The students learn to recognize and explain the basic concepts that govern each organ and organ system and their integration to maintain homeostasis, as well as some clinical aspects of failure of these systems. The organ systems covered include:  nervous, muscle, cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, male and female reproductive, gastrointestinal, and urinary.\n\nThis human physiology course is targeted to undergraduate and graduate students with an elementary background in biology. In a typical undergraduate setting, this course would fulfill requirements for students applying to professional health science programs such as medical school, nursing, physician assistant, pathologistsÃ‚â€™ assistant, physical therapy, and doctorate of physical therapy. In addition it is an ideal course in preparation for the MCAT exam.\n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/humanphysio\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4627c453e96fdd1d1a2430e067dedbfa413350eb","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Introductory+Human+Physiology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4627c453e96fdd1d1a2430e067dedbfa413350eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,39,196,83,233,111,221,29,26,36,48,224,103,222,219,250,65,51,80,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
