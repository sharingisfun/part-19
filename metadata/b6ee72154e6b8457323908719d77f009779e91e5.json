This time, you don\\&amp;#039;t play as Sir Graham, but as Connor, who must find pieces of the Mask Of Eternity, which have been scattered throughout the land, to make his homeland of Daventry alive again. Along the way, he encounters danger in many different environments. This is the first installment in the series to be in 3D, and is more of a platformer than the prior installments of the series. It is fueled by point-and-click puzzles and action, none of which are too complicated.\n\nEnjoy this great action-adventure game, ISO made by me, no crack or serial required!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6ee72154e6b8457323908719d77f009779e91e5","amp;dn":"Kings+Quest+VIII%3A+The+Mask+of+Eternity+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6ee72154e6b8457323908719d77f009779e91e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,238,114,21,78,107,132,87,50,57,8,113,157,119,240,9,119,158,145,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
