Tampa Red was another influential musical model. During his heyday in the '20s and '30s, he was billed as &quot;The Guitar Wizard,&quot; and his stunning slide work on electric or National steel guitar shows why he earned the title. His 30-year recording career produced hundreds of sides: hokum, pop, and jive, but mostly blues \n\nBig Maceo\n\nBorn Major Merriweather (or Merewether) in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, he was a self-taught pianist. In the 1920s he moved to Detroit, Michigan and began playing parties and clubs. In 1941, a desire to record led him to Chicago where he met and befriended Tampa Red. Red introduced him to Lester Melrose of Bluebird Records, who signed him to a recording contract. \nHis style had an impact on practically every post World War II blues pianist of note. His most famous song, &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot; is a staple of the blues repertoire, with artists such as Eric Clapton featuring it regularly in concert. \n\nTracklist:\n\n  1.
