The trees keep guard over her threadbare existence, with the one bright spot being CareyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s younger sister, Jenessa, who depends on Carey for her very survival. All they have is each other, as their mentally ill mother comes and goes with greater frequency. Until that one fateful day their mother disappears for good, and two strangers arrive. Suddenly, the girls are taken from the woods and thrust into a bright and perplexing new world of high school, clothes and boys.\n\nNow, Carey must face the truth of why her mother abducted her ten years ago, while haunted by a past that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let her goÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ a dark past that hides many a secret, including the reason Jenessa hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spoken a word in over a year. Carey knows she must keep her sister close, and her secrets even closer, or risk watching her new life come crashing down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f216b0d79638dc07a0e515696025162ab347e1c5","amp;dn":"Emily+Murdoch+-+If+You+Find+Me+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f216b0d79638dc07a0e515696025162ab347e1c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,22,176,215,150,56,220,7,160,229,21,105,96,37,22,42,179,71,225,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
