Syncopated rhythms, inspiring guitar tones and epic drum sounds have been his production calling card since he burst onto the metal scene in 2005. Thats right, were talking about Misha &quot;Bulb&quot; Mansoor, the prolific musician and producer behind metal projects like Periphery, Haunted Shores and Of Man Not Of Machine, just to name a few.\n\nFor years now, &quot;Bulb&quot; has been using Superior DrummerÃ‚Â® 2.0 to help design and implement his creative, often wildly complex drum tracks. For the first time ever, &quot;Bulb&quot; is making some of those signature drum sounds available to you! Welcome to the latest addition to the S2.0 Producer Presets family: S2.0 Presets - Bulb.\n\nDesigned to work with the Avatar library that comes standard in Superior DrummerÃ‚Â® 2.0, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BulbÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has created five (5) unique presets to help your next round of drum tracks cut through and stand out in a sea of distorted guitars, swift time changes and guttural vocals. If you make any sort of modern metal, rock or hard rock music with Superior DrummerÃ‚Â® 2.0, these presets are a must have.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afd031ff8f964d0488774d0104a4928f17ecb2a6","amp;dn":"Bulb+S2.0+Presets+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afd031ff8f964d0488774d0104a4928f17ecb2a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,208,49,255,143,150,77,4,136,119,77,1,4,164,146,143,23,236,178,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
