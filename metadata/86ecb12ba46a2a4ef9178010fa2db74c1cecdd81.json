Now, I downloaded this off of TPB myself so I'm not entirely sure that the tracks are all that accurate and true to the original. The track entitled Hully Gully seems to cut off just over halfway into the song, but I'm not sure if that's because the original recording cut off or if it was some sort of mistake on the part of the original uploader. Either way, this is a really great Beatles album to have and I hope you all enjoy it. Share these recordings with someone younger than you. Keep The Beatles alive.
