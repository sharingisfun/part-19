Do not look for it with the mouse, FullControl allows you to access the contents of folders on your Mac and launch files with the program of your choice! \n\nYou will see that the mouse and keyboard don\\'t need anymore, but if you need it, there are also those, plus the number keypad and the ability to shutdown, restart the computer or put it to sleep.\n\nHow can I control all the applications?!\nSimple: with FullControl you can create a specific keyboard shortcut and send it to a running program in order to control it!\nThis is the difference from the others remote applications.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Control all your applications with keyboard shortcuts;\n- Ability to add custom commands with icon, title and a shortcut;\n- You can share your shortcuts and download others new;\n- Ability to launch applications in the folder \\&quot;Applications\\&quot; and in the Dock;\n- Remote keyboard also in landscape mode;\n- Multi-touch trackpad;\n- Changing the volume of your Mac via a cursor in remote;\n- Ability to shutdown, restart, and putting to sleep the Mac;\n- Numeric pad;\n- File browser and file launcher;\n- Get a screenshot of your Mac.\n\nFullControl just installed, you have already provided the commands to control your music on iTunes, the videos play on VLC, manage live TV on EyeTV!\n\nFullControl to work properly requires FullControlHelper (2.2 or higher) installed on your Mac - Intel (OS X 10.5 or higher) and firmware 3.1.3 (or higher) installed on your iPhone or iPod Touch.\nFullControlHelper is available free from http://fullcontrol.cescobaz.com/download/\n----------------------\nIf you want to try the app, there is a lite version for free!\nWhat\\'s new in Version 2.3\n- password access support\n- command creation bug fixes again\n- reordering commands is now ok\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af3f35c8ae687a37b9fe41bc1031eaa519421f9","amp;dn":"FullControl+-+remote+control+ipod.iphone.ipad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af3f35c8ae687a37b9fe41bc1031eaa519421f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,243,243,92,138,230,135,163,123,159,228,27,193,3,30,170,81,148,33,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
