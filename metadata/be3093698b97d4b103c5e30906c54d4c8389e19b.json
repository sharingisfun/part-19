Younger, &quot;The Bomb: A New History&quot;\r\nISBN: 0061537195 | 2009 | EPUB | 256 pages | 2 MB\r\n\r\nFrom his years at Los Alamos and the Nevada Test Site to his meetings with nuclear arms experts in Moscow, former weapons designer Stephen M. Younger has witnessed firsthand the making of nuclear policy. With a deep understanding of both the technology and the politics behind nuclear weapons, he guides us from the Manhattan Project to the Cold War and into the present day, illuminating how nuclear weapons fit into our globalized, war-plagued world. Does the United States genuinely need a massive stockpile in an era of precision bombs and missile defense? Under what circumstances might we need nuclear weapons in the future? How does the proliferation of weapons in the hands of other nations affect our own nuclear policy?\r\n\r\nWith startling clarity, Younger reveals how weapons work, the myths and realities of what happens after a nuclear explosion, and how our nuclear policy evolved to what it is today. The Bomb is a compelling call to debate, and to action, that no one can afford to ignore","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3093698b97d4b103c5e30906c54d4c8389e19b","amp;dn":"Stephen+M.+Younger%2C+%26quot%3BThe+Bomb%3A+A+New+History%26quot%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be3093698b97d4b103c5e30906c54d4c8389e19b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,48,147,105,139,151,212,177,3,197,227,9,6,197,77,76,131,137,225,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
