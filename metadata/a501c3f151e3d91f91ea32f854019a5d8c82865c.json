However, many have found the process daunting. Written by an expert with over 30 years of experience, this book introduces innovative approaches to simplify the RCM process such as: single vs. multiple failure analysis, hidden failures analysis, potentially critical components analysis, run-to-failure and the difference between redundant, standby, and backup functions. Included are real life examples of flawed preventive maintenance programs and how they led to disasters that could have easily been avoided. Also illustrated in detail, with real-life examples, is the step-by-step process for developing, implementing, and maintaining a premier classical RCM program. Senior management, middle management, supervisors, and craftsmen/technicians responsible for plant safety and reliability will find this book to be invaluable as a means for establishing a first class preventive maintenance program","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a501c3f151e3d91f91ea32f854019a5d8c82865c","amp;dn":"Reliability+Centered+Maintenance+%28RCM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a501c3f151e3d91f91ea32f854019a5d8c82865c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,1,195,241,81,227,217,31,145,234,50,248,84,1,154,93,140,130,134,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
