Though this is too much material for casual fans, any serious fan of Simon &amp; Garfunkel or folk-rock will need to acquire the set, simply because it presents the albums in their best-ever sound. The duo did record a handful of tracks that didn't make the set -- and if Columbia were assembling a true &quot;collected works&quot; compilation, they would have to be included -- but the genuinely essential material is present, making it a good buy for the budget conscious.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tracklist\nCD1\n1.
