Among the new ideas presented are hypotheses on the role of dopamine and glutamate in aggression, the glutamate system in anxiety disorders, glutamate and neurodegeneration, and on the origin and progression of Parkinson's disease. Additional chapters offer novel insights into a variety of psychiatric diseases, including ADHD, stress, aggression, addiction, schizophrenia, depression, social phobias, dementias, bulimia, and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Each chapter summarizes the prevalence and symptoms of the disease and explains the involvement of dopamine and/or glutamate systems using the newer molecular approaches such as transgenic knockout or knockin mice and recent brain imaging techniques.\n\n\nPaperback: 600 pages\nPublisher: Humana Press; 2005 edition (December 25, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1617374954\nISBN-13: 978-1617374951","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e92bb4bfa3d66a7dc2ff7be9e246fc42f623b8f4","amp;dn":"Dopamine+and+Glutamate+in+Psychiatric+Disorders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e92bb4bfa3d66a7dc2ff7be9e246fc42f623b8f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,43,180,191,163,214,106,125,194,255,123,233,226,70,252,66,246,35,184,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
