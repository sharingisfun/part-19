Our clients range from kids who use Gamestudio for their first steps into computer programming, to multinational corporations who use the software for creating all sorts of simulations and advertising games. \n\nGamestudio is for everyone. It offers three levels of access in one single package: \nBeginner: Click together games or prototypes from pre-assembled game templates. A simple action game can be built in a few hours this way. \nAdvanced: Use our tutorial workshops to learn programming, and create commercial quality applications with the easy and effective lite-C programming language. Use the included level and model editors to create the artwork for your game. \nProfessional: Include Gamestudio&amp;#039;s A7 engine into your software using the Source Development Kit and your own preferred language like C++ or Delphi. Use Gamestudio&amp;#039;s straightforward art pipeline based on the FBX format for creating your levels and models with high-end editors such as MAX?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½? or MAYA?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½?. \n\nA rock-solid development system \n&quot;We&amp;#039;ve now sold close to a thousand of our &amp;#039;3D Kitten&amp;#039; game... Out of those thousand orders there has not been one bug report. Not one. That&amp;#039;s definitely a first, and this is the first product we&amp;#039;ve made with Gamestudio. That tells me something about stability.&quot; \n\nGamestudio is not a game engine, not a game editor, and not a game programming language. It&amp;#039;s all of them together. The development system contains all the needed tools for creating a commercial-quality 3D or 2D game or any other graphics application right out of the box! It comes with a state-of-the-art 3D and 2D game engine, a level editor, a model and terrain editor, the lite-C script language with compiler, editor, and debugger, as well as thousands of ready-to-use elements, such as models, level prefabs or textures. No need to purchase your tool kit and artwork by bits and parts!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice : 899 $\n\n\n\nif you want , you can buy Orginal License from :\n\n\n\n\nGame Studio\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090db3246917635fcb6c1fe5167bb8a47842039b","amp;dn":"3D+Gamestudio+Pro+A7+7.05+with+crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090db3246917635fcb6c1fe5167bb8a47842039b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,13,179,36,105,23,99,95,203,108,31,229,22,123,184,164,120,66,3,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
