Because of this, we use 2D images, like normal maps, to simulate the high resolution detail in a way that we can more easily use. \n\nWe'll begin by building the base geometry for our weapon in Softimage. Once the base geometry is modeled, we will detail and paint the improvised weapon in ZBrush using a variety of techniques. To finish up, we will generate maps for the color and sculpted detail before view our game weapon in Marmoset Toolbag. \n\nWhen you are done, you will have a better understanding of the workflow involved in building and sculpting high resolution props and set pieces with Softimage and ZBrush and creating usable assets from them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12219113346542e381df7e8c9c59aed4b85fc2b1","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Creating+Game+Weapons+in+Softimage+and+ZBrush","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12219113346542e381df7e8c9c59aed4b85fc2b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,33,145,19,52,101,66,227,129,223,126,140,156,89,174,212,184,95,194,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
