There have been a ton of lineup changes over the years, but the one constant has been guitarist extraordinaire Jeff Waters. This 2 disc collection covers the band's first ten years.\n\n\n\nThe first disc has seven of the band's music videos, along with footage of TV appearances, some behind the scenes stuff and some live performances captured on home video.\n\n\n\nThe second disc is an extensive interview with Jeff Waters. He discusses in detail the history and early days of the band, and also mentions some of their more recent output. If you're a fan of Annihilator, this DVD is a great addition to your collection. It has a little bit of everything, and there is a ton of material. The two discs combined have a running time of almost 4 hours.\n\n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9de8246b2ce187c9762fbf0a900e163696bd03b0","amp;dn":"Annihilator+-+Ten+Years+in+Hell+%282006%29+%5B2xDVD9%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9de8246b2ce187c9762fbf0a900e163696bd03b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,232,36,107,44,225,135,201,118,47,191,10,144,14,22,54,150,189,3,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
