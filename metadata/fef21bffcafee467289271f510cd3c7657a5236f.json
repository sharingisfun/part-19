Privileging a Eurocentric approach, this traditional paradigm obscures the significance of the indigenous rich in non-Western regions and fails to recognize the contributions of the Orient. In this book, Peter Gran seeks to reframe current historical debates, presenting a model of analysis based on the rise of the rich. Gran outlines the structure of this new paradigm, building upon metanarrative concepts from Marxism to liberalism.\n\nRather than a history of clashing civilizations, he identifies a history of resolving conflicts through negotiations among the wealthy classes of various regions. Fundamental to his theory is evidence demonstrating the existence of non-European ruling classes with power in interregional affairs. Far-reaching in its historical scope, Gran's work lays the foundation for a critical rethinking of world history and offers a vital contribution to the field.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 269 pages\n# Publisher: Syracuse Univ Pr (Sd); First Edition edition (February 28, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0815631715\n# ISBN-13: 978-0815631712","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef21bffcafee467289271f510cd3c7657a5236f","amp;dn":"The+Rise+of+the+Rich%3AA+New+View+of+Modern+World+History%7BBBS%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef21bffcafee467289271f510cd3c7657a5236f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,242,27,255,202,254,228,103,40,146,113,245,16,205,60,118,87,165,35,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
