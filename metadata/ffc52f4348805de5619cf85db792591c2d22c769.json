Perry\n2012 \nEnglish\nISBN: 1449399894\n336 Pages \nPDF  \n60.9 MB\n\n\nThis inquisitive and highly useful book shows the hacker and maker communities how to bring science and software into their nutrition and fitness routines.\n\nThe digital age has made a big splash with new web-connected gear in the sports/fitness world. Fitness for Geeks covers many of these new self-tracking tools and apps, including Endomondo, FitBit, Garmin Connect, Alpine Replay, Zeo, and more. The book shows you how the gear and apps work, relate to human physiology, and can be hacked and integrated into your lifestyle and fitness routine. \n\nFitness For Geeks is designed to appeal to a broad audience of techies and other engineers, athletes, gym rats, adventurers, in short anyone with a scuffed-up muddy pair of running or cycling shoes (or bare feet) who wants to take a cerebral approach to health. The &quot;measure mantra&quot; is a useful concept for people seeking fitness (&quot;what gets measured gets managed and fixed&quot;), and now you have the software, gear, and companion book to do it. \n\nThe book includes an eclectic mix of interviews with a wide range of experts, including two NFL pro football players, a mountaineering guide, a national expert on vitamin C, a runner who won a hot Boston Marathon, a scientist who tests the effects of fasting on mice and tumors, an MIT scientist who studies our mTOR growth pathway, an expert sports masseuse, and a former Israeli soldier who studied the diet of the Spartans, Greeks, and Macedonians. \n\nFitness For Geeks has detailed chapters on nutrition as well as outdoor and indoor fitness and sports, with explanations of various protocols (for resistance training and sprinting), the physiological aspects of exercise (such as metabolic equivalent of task and calculating your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and total energy expenditure), and of course a number of apps and tools that can accompany your workouts.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/f85d/1c90d4ccf.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc52f4348805de5619cf85db792591c2d22c769","amp;dn":"Fitness+for+Geeks%3A+Real+Science%2C+Great+Nutrition%2C+and+Good+Healt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc52f4348805de5619cf85db792591c2d22c769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,197,47,67,72,128,93,229,97,156,248,93,183,146,89,28,45,34,199,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
