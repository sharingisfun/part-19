Upon spectacular and historical aerial images of Arizona's canyons, Turrell recalls his formal research on natural light and his friendship with the Hopi Indians. The film gives Turrell the opportunity to present his masterpiece, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roden CraterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a true celestrial light &quot;observatory&quot;.\n\nThis was produced for the Centre Pompidou in 2006. It documents the infamously reclusive Earthworks artist James Turrell, and his majestic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roden CraterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ project that he's been working on for about 25 years now. Since Turrell's work is not open to the public, and you're likely to get shot trespassing out in New Mexico where this sits, this is your only chance to see it. Highly recommended for those interested in late modern and contemporary art!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Turrell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Turrell&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n---\n\nDVD-Rip (FairUse Wizard 3D)\nFormat: MKV\nVideo codec: H264 @ 1458 Kbps / 688x408 / 25 fps\nAudio codec: MP3 @ 320 Kbps / 48 KHz\nDuration: 27:25\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: none\nFile size: 349 Mb\n\n---\n\nSHARE CULTURE, SHARE KNOWLEDGE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:133b7bf4df62192d0b9d1d3a31b597b9eb58eec6","amp;dn":"James+Turrell+Passageways+%5BCarine+Asscher%2C+1995%5D+H264-MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"133b7bf4df62192d0b9d1d3a31b597b9eb58eec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,59,123,244,223,98,25,45,11,157,29,58,49,181,151,185,235,88,238,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
