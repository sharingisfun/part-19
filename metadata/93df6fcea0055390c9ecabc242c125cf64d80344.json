As its title suggests,\n  it is a concept album based on author J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel.\n\n  Today the album is considered by many critics to be a classic of the progressive\n  rock genre as well as Hansson's best work. In addition, it can be seen as an early\n  example of multi-instrumentalist rock, predating similar 1970s albums by artists\n  such as Mike Oldfield, Rick Wakeman, and Brian Eno.\n\n  Bo Hansson passed away on April 23, 2010, at the age of 67.\n\n\nTracks (2002 Digital Remaster)\n  01 - Leaving Shire / FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rsta Vandringen\n  02 - The Old Forest (Tom Bombadil) / Den Gamla Skogen\n  03 - Fog On The Barrow Downs / I Skuggornas Rike\n  04 - The Black Riders (Flight To The Ford) / De Svarta Ryttarna (Flykten FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n VadstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤llet)\n  05 - At The House Of Elrond (The Ring Goes South) / I Elronds Hus (Ringen Vandrar SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶derut)\n  06 - A Journey In The Dark / En Vandring I MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rker\n  07 - LothlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â²rien\n  08 - Shadowfax / Skuggfaxe\n  09 - The Horns Of Rohan (The Battle Of The Pelennor Fields) / Rohans Horn (Slaget Vid Pelennors SlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤tter)\n  10 - Dreams In The House Of Healing / DrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶mmar I LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤kandets Hus\n  11 - Homeward Bound (The Scouring Of The Shire) / HemfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rden (Fylke Rensas)\n  12 - The Grey Havens / De GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ Hamnarna\n  13 - Early Sketches From Middle Earth / Tidiga Skisser FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n MidgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd\n\n\n source....: dussin FLAC rel.\n app.......: foobar2000 v1.1.9\n encoder...: lame 3.98r\n codec.....: mp3 vbr v0\n\n embedded front cover album art, 500x500.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93df6fcea0055390c9ecabc242c125cf64d80344","amp;dn":"Bo+Hansson+-+Lord+of+the+rings+%28Remastered%29+%282002%29+%5BMP3+V0%5D+duss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93df6fcea0055390c9ecabc242c125cf64d80344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,223,111,206,160,5,83,144,201,236,171,194,66,193,37,207,100,216,3,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
