Craig (Ice Cube) manages to get fired on his day off (though he claims it's through no fault of his own) and spends the day hanging out with his buddy Smokey (Chris Tucker) and trying to avoid his father (John Witherspoon), who wants him to find another job immediately. Smokey (whose name might have something to do with his tremendous fondness for marijuana) has even more serious problems; he was given $200 worth of weed to sell by Big Worm (Faizon Love), but he ended up smoking it instead, and if he can't come up with the money by the end of the day, he'll be in a world of hurt (and will put Craig in the same place just for being his friend). And Deebo (Tom &quot;Tiny&quot; Lister, Jr.), a gargantuan bully who roams the neighborhood on his bicycle, has it in for Craig, while Craig tries his best just to stay out of his way. As one would expect, Friday features a strong hip-hop soundtrack, featuring tracks by such artists as Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, Mack 10, and Funkdoobiest, as well as old-school R&amp;B selections from The Isley Brothers, Roger, and Rose Royce. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 31 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:963ada72eccdc9a69ac6b493d02c18306a1c57f0","amp;dn":"Friday%281995%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"963ada72eccdc9a69ac6b493d02c18306a1c57f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,58,218,114,236,205,201,166,154,198,180,147,208,44,24,48,106,28,87,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
