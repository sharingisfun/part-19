It features the band's hit single, &quot;Do You Call My Name&quot;, which had a music video and was followed by their second single, &quot;Rectifier&quot;. From One reached #154 on the Billboard 200. Universal Records originally hosted a listening party so that people could listen to the entire album before it was released.\r\n\r\nThe first track &quot;Do You Call My Name&quot; was featured during the introduction and before commercial breaks during the 2006 NFL Draft on ESPN, as well as video games MX Unleashed and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003. It also was used as an entrance theme for a wrestler Shawn Daivari during his Ring of Honor days, in addition to Ophidian as a singles theme on the independent circuit, most notably in Chikara Pro. The second track &quot;Rectifier&quot; was featured on the game Project Gotham Racing 2. Ra was featured as Artist of the Month on antimusic.com. Keavin Wiggins named From One the top album of the decade.\r\n\r\nTrack List\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Do You Call My Name&quot; (Ticotin, Skoota Warner) \t\r\n2. \t&quot;Rectifier&quot;   \t\r\n3. \t&quot;Fallen Rock Zone&quot;   \t\r\n4. \t&quot;Only&quot;   \t\r\n5. \t&quot;On My Side&quot;   \t\r\n6. \t&quot;Violator&quot;   \t\r\n7. \t&quot;I Believe&quot;   \t\r\n8. \t&quot;Parole&quot;   \t\r\n9. \t&quot;High Sensitivity&quot;   \t\r\n10. \t&quot;Skorn&quot;   \t\r\n11. \t&quot;Walking and Thinking&quot;   \r\n12. \t&quot;Sky&quot; (Ticotin, Alain Johanness)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52e1cc8b3709e0188949a15f37572a907f8feaa8","amp;dn":"Ra+-+From+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52e1cc8b3709e0188949a15f37572a907f8feaa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,225,204,139,55,9,224,24,137,73,161,95,55,87,42,144,127,143,234,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
