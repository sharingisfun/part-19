Callum is a Nought -- a Ã¢â‚¬Å“colourlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ member of the underclass who were once slaves to the Crosses. The two have been friends since early childhood, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as far as it can go. In their world, Noughts and Crosses simply donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mix. Against a background of prejudice and distrust, intensely highlighted by violent terrorist activity, a romance builds between Sephy and Callum -- a romance that is to lead both of them into terrible danger. Can they possibly find a way to be together?\n\nIn this gripping, stimulating and totally absorbing novel, black and white are right and wrong.\n\nThis edition also includes 'An Eye for an Eye' which is a short novella written for 2003 World Book Day.\n\n================\n\nFor more quality uploads, please visit my profile and my thread :\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&lt;/a&gt;\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nDovah\t\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79bf75a5999b90e036b2a8ac46227e5162790ab7","amp;dn":"Malorie+Blackman%2C+Noughts+and+Crosses+Series+epub+mobi+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79bf75a5999b90e036b2a8ac46227e5162790ab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,191,117,165,153,155,144,224,54,178,168,172,70,34,126,81,98,121,10,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
