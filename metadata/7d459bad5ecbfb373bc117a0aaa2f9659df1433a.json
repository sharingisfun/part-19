These recordings, the great majority of which \nare released for the first time, give the listener the opportunity to hear songs develop in the studio. Some appear without later overdubs and orchestral backings that were included on the recordings first time round. A major highlight is the discovery of previously unheard versions of 'Poetry In Motion' recorded in New York with King Curtis on sax. This version was recorded a short time before the 'hit' version, cut in Nashville with Boots Randolph. Alternative takes of the Randolph version are also included. Another major find is an unissued song in 'Please Help Me I'm Falling', recorded four months after the Hank \nLocklin hit recording. Bear Family. 2011.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d459bad5ecbfb373bc117a0aaa2f9659df1433a","amp;dn":"Johnny+Tillotson...The+Outtakes%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d459bad5ecbfb373bc117a0aaa2f9659df1433a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,69,155,173,94,203,251,55,59,193,23,160,170,162,249,101,157,241,67,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
