I have to thank the original ripper DIVADANIELA and recommend you to watch this and I'll give you a few reasons though I could keep going on:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Georges Delerue noir like score\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fantastic USA sceneries\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Charles Vanel brilliant and emphatic performance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Malvina Silverberg (oh yes, the gorgeous half naked red head Lina)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Michele Mercier \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ a very young Stefania Sandrelli\n\noh, and if you want to chat about obscure or mainstream films in a relaxed atmosphere with open minded people, check our freakyflicks message board link at the bottom of this description.\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056845/combined\n\nPlot: A down on his luck French ex-paratrooper turned amateur boxer takes a job as a private secretary and bodyguard for a corrupt French banker who is on the run from French authorities. \n\n\nReview: Surprisingly good, 24 July 2003 \n\nAuthor: StevieGB from London, England \n\n\nI saw this at London's National Film Theatre a couple of nights ago. The print, the best they could lay their hands on, was scratched and the colour had faded to the extent that much of it was a pinky sepia. Also, I could find very few reviews to read beforehand (zero on the IMDB). So I wasn't expecting much.\n\nAnd I was therefore very pleasantly surprised. The tale of an old crooked banker who absconds to the US with a young male golddigger really works. Charles Vanel (who was so brilliant in The Wages of Fear) and Jean-Paul Belmondo are a wonderful team, as a very spiky and spiteful Father/Son relationship grows between them.\n\nAs a travelogue of a journey from New York to the Deep South it's fascinating, and reminded me, of all things, of Easy Rider, which I very much suspect it may have influenced.\n\nThere's a few problems with it, mainly due to the fact the Jean-Pierre Melville never really got the timing right when it came to editing emotional scenes (especially at the end).\n\nBut if you're a fan of the early Melville movies, Le Doulos in particular, then check it out.\n\n\nTECHNICAL INFO:\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 920 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 41mn\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 271 Kbps\nWriting application                      : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nWriting library                          : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 2\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (MPEG)\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 41mn\nBit rate                                 : 1 174 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.222\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.255\nStream size                              : 850 MiB (92%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 1h 41mn\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 84.0 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                         : 32.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 1 channel\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 60.8 MiB (7%)\nAlignment                                : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 253 ms\nWriting library                          : LAME3.97b\nEncoding settings                        : -m m -V 4 -q 3 -lowpass 17.5 --vbr-new -b 32\n\n \n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n \nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\n sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
