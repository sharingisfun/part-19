Watch out for the latest chapter 104 which would be coming out 10 Feb 2010. Fans, keep your eyes peeled on http://www.onemanga.com ^_^  Due to licensing restrictions FMA isn't downloadable on these manga sites, you can only read them online. Thats really frustrating if you want to take it on a PC offline and read it peacefully (and without that IM window popping up of course). So I made this. \n\nI only collected the images, grouped them, zipped them and renamed their extensions. All thanks go to the original 'scanlet'ors :)\n\n87 chapters are in lossless png format, the rest in normal jpeg format. You can use any comic book reader supporting cbz format. I use coview. This page on wikipedia describes what is a comic book reader and also links to some of them http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Book_Archive_file\n\nIf you don't want any extra software then you can just open these files in your Compression utility like WinZip, WinRAR, 7Z etc.\n\nKeep seeding and enjoy!\n\n[I'd seed only between 2:00-8:00 IST which is GMT+5:30. Pls put up with it]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df36003c085b194efe9f032f1f697bd8d60c99ff","amp;dn":"Full+Metal+Alchemist+manga+Chapter+1-103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df36003c085b194efe9f032f1f697bd8d60c99ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,54,0,60,8,91,25,78,254,159,3,47,31,105,123,216,214,12,153,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
