The cover art was designed by Gabriel Serbanescu, who also designed art for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2013 debut album, Dead Or Alive.\nFor this, their sophomore album, A Breach Of Silence brought back legendary Swedish producers Fredrik Nordstrom and Henrik Udd (Bring Me the Horizon, Arch Enemy, In Flames) flying them Ã¢â‚¬Å“down underÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to record at Acolyte Studios in Brisbane, Australia. The masters were later mixed at the infamous Studio Fredman in Sweden. A Breach Of Silence are known for their unique mix of modern metalcore and power-metal vocal breakdowns which many of their fans refer to as Ã¢â‚¬ËœpowercoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Clocking in at over 56 minutes, The Darkest Road delivers fourteen tracks of technical, impressive songwriting that will forever be remembered as the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defining moment in music history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Breach Of Silence was thrown into the spotlight when they won AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prestigious Q Music Award (2012) in the Best Heavy Song category.

In March of 2014, the band released their controversial Night Rider Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfirst-person shooterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ music video which was inspired by their obsession with FPS video games and 1960Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classic westerns such as Hang Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem High and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nDead Or Alive       2013\n\n\n\nLine-Up:\nMat Cosgrove     Guitar\nBlair Layt     bass/vocals\nRhys Flannery     lead vocals\nAndrew Cotterell     drums\nKerrod Dabelstein     guitar\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist:  A Breach of Silence\nAlbum: The Darkest Road\nGenre: Melodic Metalcore\nSubGenre: Melodic Death Metal\nCountry Of Origin: Australia\nRelease Date: 7th October 2014\nYear: 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nPlaying Time: 00:42:20\nSize: 130.50 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
