A natural storyteller, Grosz writes about the remarkable characters he met - on both sides of the law - as he matched wits with elk poachers, salmon snaggers, commercial-market duck hunters, and a host of other law-breakers. Best of all, though, these stories are so remarkably entertaining you won't want to put them down. Wildlife Wars is the winner of the 2000 National Outdoor Book Award, Nature and the Environment.\n\nWritten by Terry Grosz\nRead by Pete Simonelli\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 96 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\n-------------------------\nVisit Us:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29ea3ac247368bd48851eaea52d78791e49270d9","amp;dn":"Wildlife+Wars+-+Terry+Grosz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29ea3ac247368bd48851eaea52d78791e49270d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,234,58,194,71,54,139,212,136,81,234,234,82,215,135,145,228,146,112,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
