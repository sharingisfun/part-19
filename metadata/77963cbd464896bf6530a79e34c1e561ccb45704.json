'Information Visualization' explores the use of computer-supported interactive graphical representations to explain data and amplify cognition. It provides a means to communicate ideas or facts about the data, to validate hypotheses, and facilitates the discovery of new facts via exploration. This book introduces the concepts and methods of Information Visualization in an easy-to-understand way, illustrating how to pictorially represent structured and unstructured data, making it easier to comprehend and interpret. Riccardo Mazza focuses on the human aspects of the process of visualization rather than the algorithmic or graphic design aspects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77963cbd464896bf6530a79e34c1e561ccb45704","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Information+Visualization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77963cbd464896bf6530a79e34c1e561ccb45704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,150,60,189,70,72,150,191,101,48,167,158,52,193,229,97,204,180,87,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
