It was directed by Hemen Gupta, who had remained private secretary to Subhash Chandra Bose, and went on to direct many films including, Taksaal (1956), also starring Balraj Sahni, and his tribute Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose (1966).\n\nAbdur Rehman Khan (Balraj Sahni), a middle-aged dry fruit seller from Afghanistan, comes to Calcutta to hawk his merchandise and befriends a small Bengali girl called Mini (Sonu) who reminds him of his own daughter Amina back in Afghanistan. He puts up at a boarding house along with his countrymen. Since he is short of money he decides to sell his goods on credit for increasing his business. Later, when he goes to collect his money, one of his customers abuses him and in the fight that ensues Rehman warns that he will not tolerate abuse and stabs the man when he does not stop the abuse. In the court Rehman's lawyer tries to obfuscate the facts but in his characteristic and simple fashion Rehman states the truth in a matter of fact way. The judge, pleased with Rehman's honesty, gives him 10 years' rigorous imprisonment instead of the death sentence. On the day of his release, he goes to meet Mini but discovers that she has grown up into a woman and is about to get married. Mini does not recognize Rehman, who realises that his own daughter must have forgotten him too. Mini's father gives Rehman the money for travelling back to Afghanistan out of Mini's wedding budget to which Mini agrees; she also sends a gift for Rehman's daughter. The film ends with Rehman travelling back to his homeland.\n\nThis movie has the melodious superhit song, &quot;Ae Mere Pyaare Watan&quot;, sung by Manna Dey.\n\nimdb link :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055039/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055039/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast:\nBalraj Sahni\nUsha Kiran\nSajjan\nSonu.\n\nMedia Info :\nLanguage - Hindi (Indian)\nVideo Size -  808 MB\nVideo Codec - H.264/AVC\nVideo Res - 640 x 416\nVideo Frame Rate - 25 fps @ 875 Kbps\nAudio Codec - MP3\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 2 Hour 9 mins\n\nPosters: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Rjwrh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Rjwrh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fDzIB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fDzIB.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/De8kB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/De8kB.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SD4xN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SD4xN.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DHART.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DHART.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xrMY9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xrMY9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/e5G8Q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/e5G8Q.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0gdRH.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0gdRH.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/c5f14.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/c5f14.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/a6doA.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/a6doA.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
