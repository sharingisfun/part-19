In the presence of three crowned heads of state - Napoleon III of France, Emperor Franz-Joseph of Austria and Victor Emmanuel II of Piedmont-Sardinia (later the King of all Italy) - the armies clashed in a bitterly fought contest that would leave more than 40,000 dead and give the battle a reputation for savagery that would inspire not only the formation of the Red Cross, but also the first Geneva Convention. As a crucial climax to the Second Italian War of Independence, this title covers the build-up to the battle, including actions at Montebello, Palestro and Magenta that led to the decisive moment of the campaign. Full-color battlescene artwork and detailed maps illustrate this comprehensive account of the commanders, armies, plans and aftermath of one of the bloodiest battles of the period","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f4aa269902c83e976df0e403df6d3771bb454e0","amp;dn":"Solferino+1859%3A+The+Battle+for+Italy%27s+Freedom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f4aa269902c83e976df0e403df6d3771bb454e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,74,162,105,144,44,131,233,118,223,14,64,61,246,211,119,27,180,84,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
