Somewhere in Mexico, cocaine is being packaged in barrels and concealed in a sewage truck. The truck is driven across the border and stored at a sewage treatment plant. The Counselor goes to Amsterdam on what he claims is a business trip, but is actually a meeting with a diamond dealer in order to purchase an engagement ring for Laura. Back in the United States, the Counselor proposes to Laura, and she accepts. Later, he attends a party at the penthouse owned by Reiner (Bardem) and his girlfriend Malkina (Diaz). The Counselor and Reiner have a lengthy discussion, during which Reiner claims that the Counselor is not capitalizing on his position of power as much as he could be.\n\nThe Counselor meets with Westray (Pitt), a business associate, to express interest in a drug deal with a four thousand percent return rate. Westray warns the Counselor about becoming involved in such a deal, saying that Mexican cartels are merciless, particularly to lawyers. Later, the Counselor visits one of his clients, a prison inmate named Ruth (Rosie Perez) whose son, a biker known as &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (Richard Cabral) has recently been arrested for speeding. The Counselor agrees to bail him out of jail.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36216f04419c373535cc43382368c294ca0a05d1","amp;dn":"The+Counselor+%282013%29+TSCamRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36216f04419c373535cc43382368c294ca0a05d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,33,111,4,65,156,55,53,53,204,67,56,35,104,194,148,202,10,5,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
