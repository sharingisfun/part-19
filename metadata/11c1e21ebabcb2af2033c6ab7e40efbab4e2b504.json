The editor, Ms. Donnelly, was involved in developing a comprehensive education curriculum for those new to cheese making, which focused on the science of cheese, principally to promote cheese quality and safety. Many of the chapters in this book focus on aspects of that requisite knowledge.\n\nExplains the process of transformation of milk to cheese and how sensory attributes of cheese are evaluated.\nProvides an overview of cheese safety and regulations governing cheese making, both in the US and abroad, to ensure safety.\nExplores how the tools of molecular biology provide new insights into the complexity of the microbial biodiversity of cheeses.\nExamines the biodiversity of traditional cheeses as a result of traditional practices, and overviews research on the stability of the microbial consortium of select traditional cheese varieties.\nKey text for cheese makers, scientists, students, and cheese enthusiasts who wish to expand their knowledge of cheeses and traditional foods","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c1e21ebabcb2af2033c6ab7e40efbab4e2b504","amp;dn":"Cheese+and+Microbes%5BMyeBookShelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c1e21ebabcb2af2033c6ab7e40efbab4e2b504","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,193,226,30,186,188,178,175,32,51,198,171,126,64,239,186,180,226,181,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
