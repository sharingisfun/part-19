Robinson\nCambridge University Press | May 2005 | PDF | ISBN10: 0521812034 | 480 pages | 11.9 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Urban-Insects-Arachnids-Handbook-Entomology/dp/0521812534&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Urban-Insects-Arachnids-Handbook-Entomology/dp/0521812534&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe rise of biological control techniques and integrated pest management (IPM), and their successful application in agricultural systems, has attracted many entomologists to attempt the crossover of these methods into household and industrial environments. Covering all the major groups of insects and other arthropods considered urban pests, this reference provides the reader with an up-to-date and comprehensive review of basic biology, behavior, distribution and, most importantly, control methodology.\n\n&quot;Handbook of Urban Insects and Arachnids is an excellent reference text for urban entomologists. It is the first international census of the pests affecting households, structures, public health, and landscapes. With internationalization and the &quot;shrinking globe,&quot; pest distributions are expanding. In addition, lines between structures, public health, and landscapes, as well as lines between regional and international research and cooperation on urban pests, are becoming less static. Thus, this resource is a timely addition to our libraries, and it will fill an important niche.&quot; \n\nCONTENTS\nPreface page vii\nPart I Urban entomology\n1 Introduction 3\n2 Theurban ecosystem 6\n3 Peststatus and pest control 15\nPart II Insects in the urban environment\n4 Blattaria 35\n5 Coleoptera 65\n6 Collembola, Dermaptera 139\n7 Diptera, Ephemeroptera 147\n8 Hemiptera, Homoptera 202\n9 Hymenoptera 224\n10 Isoptera 291\n11 Lepidoptera 328\n12 Mantodea, Neuroptera 346\n13 Orthoptera, Phasmatodea 350\n14 Phthiraptera 359\n15 Plecoptera, Psocoptera 365\n16 Siphonaptera 374\n17 Thysanoptera, Thysanura, Trichoptera 382\nPart III Other arthropods in the urban environment\n18 Arthropoda 389\nFamily, genus, species index 441\nIndex 456\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ac51a412bc4d8e78463a37c1545b55fb16002d4","amp;dn":"Urban+Insects+and+Arachnids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ac51a412bc4d8e78463a37c1545b55fb16002d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,197,26,65,43,196,216,231,132,99,163,124,21,69,181,95,177,96,2,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
