Aside from a few individual works by other composers (Grieg, Rachmaninov, Shostakovich, Barber, and Britten), that about sums up the entire repertoire for this particular combination. \n\nIt's a difficult medium, because the low notes of the cello tend to get covered by the bass of the piano, and balance between the two instruments is always precarious. Of course, when you have artists of the calibre of Rostropovich and Richter, there's nothing to worry about. This classic set has been the reference edition since the day it was issued, and deservedly so!!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c42ea951f0d302dbccbaa8d1bf9273530612ee7","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+The+Complete+Music+for+Cello+and+Piano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c42ea951f0d302dbccbaa8d1bf9273530612ee7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,66,234,149,31,13,48,45,188,203,170,141,27,249,39,53,48,97,46,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
