Influenced by minimalism and the likes of Gorecki and Part, Einhorn's music is tonal and accessible. The texts--in Latin and antique French--are from the Bible, and from writings by (mostly) medieval women, including Joan of Arc herself. Joan is represented by the reliably intelligent and well-tuned Anonymous 4 (Ruth Cunningham, Marsha Genensky, Susan Hellauer and Johanna Rose); soprano Susan Narucki sings her often high-flying lines with beauty and clarity.\n\nMP3 files (192Kbps)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:412e035565390398c3134ed72d9c8963fdd29f13","amp;dn":"Voices+of+Light+%28Soundtrack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"412e035565390398c3134ed72d9c8963fdd29f13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,46,3,85,101,57,3,152,195,19,78,215,45,156,137,99,253,210,159,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
