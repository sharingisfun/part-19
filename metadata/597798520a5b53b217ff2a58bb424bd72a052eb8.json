This would incentivise assassination of individuals because the assassin, knowing when the action would take place, could profit by making an accurate bet on the time of the subject's death. Because the payoff is for knowing the date rather than performing the action of the assassin, it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability for the assassination.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:597798520a5b53b217ff2a58bb424bd72a052eb8","amp;dn":"Assassination+Politics+PDF+-+Jim+Bell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"597798520a5b53b217ff2a58bb424bd72a052eb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,119,152,82,10,91,83,178,23,255,42,88,187,66,75,215,42,5,46,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
