This research area focuses on applying optimization techniques to supply chain management problems. The research papers that make up the volume provide a snapshot of state-of-the-art optimization methods within the field. This book presents rigorous modelling approaches for supply chain operations problems with a goal of improving supply chain performance (or the performance of some segment thereof). It contains high-quality works from leading researchers in the field whose expertise fits within this scope. The book provides a diverse blend of research topics and novel modelling and solution approaches for difficult classes of supply chain operations, planning, and design problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bcfee1f11834eaf2b0859292419e9b122d5e80a","amp;dn":"Applied+Optimization+Vol.+98+-+Supply+Chain+Optimization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bcfee1f11834eaf2b0859292419e9b122d5e80a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,207,238,31,17,131,78,175,43,8,89,41,36,25,233,177,34,213,232,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
