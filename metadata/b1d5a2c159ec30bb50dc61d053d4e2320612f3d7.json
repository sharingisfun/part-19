They are convinced that the earth and the entire universe are the result of a supernatural creation event which occurred just thousands of years ago, not billions of years.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-Why do conventional methods for dating rocks differ so radically?\n-What does carbon-14 found in diamonds tell us?\n-Was there accelerated nuclear decay in earthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history?\n-Are the creation and Flood accounts genuine historic events?\n\nThese and many other questions are addressed in ThousandsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Not Billions. This book summarizes eight years of research by the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) and a team of scientists, whose goal was to explore the age of the earth from a biblical perspective. The project title was Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth, or RATE.\nThe age of the earth is one of the most divisive topics today, much debated by scholars and laypersons alike. What one believes about the age of the earth goes a long way in determining world views. The Bible is explicit that the earth is young, but many people feel that science has proved our planet is more than four billion year old. ThousandsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Not Billions provides a compelling challenge to Darwinian evolution.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Donald DeYoung is a graduate of Michigan Tech University (B.S., M.S., physics), Iowa State University (Ph.D, physics), and Grace Seminary (M.Div.)
