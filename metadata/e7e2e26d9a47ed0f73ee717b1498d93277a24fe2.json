The local ban list is for bans that originate \non the server (via kickbans, etc). The global ban list is for bans \nthat are initiated by a trusted ban list authority. The ban lists \nstore the date of ban, the name of the admin who initiated the ban, \nthe reason for the ban, and a URL field for any relevant ban evidence \n(demos etc).\n \nNew Feature ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ DEMO URL\n\n- A DemoURL can now be specified in the server playlist, this is used \nto indicate the location of stored demo files to userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in-game (see the     multiplayer options screen). A good practice for server admins would \nbe to share the demo folder via FTP, this would allow users to grab demos \nof games they starred in, and also (very importantly!) allow users and \nanti-cheat authorities to download evidence for cheat reporting. \nIncidentally, it is now possible to dump all users unique steamID's from \nboth in-game, and in-demos to the console or text file (this will make \nreporting abusive players and enforcing bans incredibly easy).\n \nGAME BALANCE\n\n- RPG's now deal additional damage to HMMWV's.\n- Lowered m200 and m110 sniper rifle damages. The only 1 shot possible \n  is now  headshots.\n- Flak jacket now has a lower BP cost, and a slight effectiveness buff.\n- Diablo damage adjusted.\n- Weapon is taken out of ADS and accuracy decreases when jumping.\n \nOPTIMIZATIONS &amp; FIXES\n\n- The Rhino drones weapon attachment was not being properly moved with \n  the Rhino drone on dedicated servers, causing the rockets to fire \n  incorrectly. This is now fixed.\n- We have added some animation optimizations for large player games.\n- Several UI related improvements were added for large player games.\n- Fixed scaling text zooming on Battle Commander when opening up the \n  battle chat or squad UI.\n- Switched the buttons around on the load out rename confirmation dialog \n  to better abide by conventions.\n- Improved SLI/CrossFireX support.\n- A few reported issues with WinXP 64 bit edition have been addressed.\n- Improved menu navigation with analogue controls.\n \nGENERAL IMPROVEMENTS\n\n- User feedback for kicks and bans has been improved.\n- The intermission lobby now displays clan tags.\n- Text chat is now possible in the kill cam, spawn selection, and \n  intermission lobby screens.\n \nNEW SETTINGS &amp; CONTROL OPTIONS\n\n- EnableD3D10/11 is now accessible via the system settings menu.\n- Mouse acceleration is now accessible via the controls menu.\n- Mouse smoothing is now accessible via the controls menu.\n\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1.
