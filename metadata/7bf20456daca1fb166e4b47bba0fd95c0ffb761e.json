Tom Bearden&amp;#039;s fascinating books and other corresponding documents which gathers together an amazing 30+ years of research into the unknown and often controversial areas of natural sciences. The scope of his work is unparalleled and can only be grasped after you&amp;#039;ve read all of his major books which deal with such important topics as extracting energy from active vacuum, new electromagnetics as Tesla had envisioned it and new application based upon it, especially in areas of medicine and modern warfare. Serving as Lt. Col. in US Army where he acted as senior scientist in developement of major defense systems, tactics and operational technical intelligence. His specialty was nuclear weapons employment, computerized wargames, missile countermeasures and intelligence analysis of Soviet scalar superweapons of which he is world famous. What distinguishes him from the rest is that he actually dared to write some books covering this upmost covert warfare which has been under development for the past 50+ years in special black military projects all around the world. By trying to understand the physics of those terrifying weapons he realized that a major shift of paradigm in science is required in order to properly understand how they actually worked. The results of this research and startling new applications are layed out in his fascinating books, articles, slide presentations etc., where he tries to explain the hardcore science in layman&amp;#039;s terms which makes his work especially appealing to everyday people. A major collection not to be missed!\n\nOf special importance in this collection are all his major books:\n- AIDS - Biological warfare (1988): explains how diseases can be caused and cured purely on an electromagnetic basis\n- Excalibur briefing - Explaining paranormal phenomena (1988): an attempt to scientifically explain all paranormal things such as UFOs (any kind), psychics, remove viewing, psi phenomena and many other unexplained and puzzling phenomena\n- Gravitobiology - A new biophysics (1991): applying extended electromagnetic to living systems this unique book gives an insight in a new and exciting branch of biophysics called electrogravitobiology or short gravitobiology\n- Final secret of free energy (1993): short booklet explaining the basic principle of asymmetric regauging inside any electric circuit for purposes of extracting free energy\n- Energy from vacuum-concepts and principles (2002): considered a bible of free energy physics and systems, his best book ever written\n- Fer de lance (2002): breakthrough book on advanced Tesla weapons systems clandestinely developed by major superpowers, how they work and history of their usage\n- Oblivion - America at the Brink (2005): his newest blockbuster and major tour-de-force of advanced Tesla weapons and their use in weather engineering and other strategic uses all around the world, intended as a briefing for highest government officials\n\nList of all 211 files in the archive:\nAdams Active Thermo Electric High Voltage Pulsed DC Permanent Magnet Switched Reluctance Electric Motor.mht\nAdams Motor Theory.pdf\nAquino -
