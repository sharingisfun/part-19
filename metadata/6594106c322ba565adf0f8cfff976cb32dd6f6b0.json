Although it was not intended as such, it is now considered a side project of Shagrath's, and the current lineup consists of him on rhythm guitar, along with Athera from Susperia as the vocalist, Ricky Black on lead guitar, BjÃƒÂ¶rn Luna on bass guitar and Tony White on drums. The band plays in the style of bands such as MotÃƒÂ¶rhead, and draws heavily upon imagery from the motorcycling subculture.\n\nTo date, Chrome Division has released three albums, Doomsday Rock 'n Roll in 2006, Booze, Broads and Beelzebub in 2008, &quot;3rd Round Knock Out&quot; in 2011 and Infernal Rock Eternal in 2014. Chrome Division also released a music video for the song &quot;Serial Killer&quot; in an attempt to publicise the album, directed by noted Swedish director Patric Ullaeus.                                        1. \tGood Morning Riot (Instrumental) \t01:28 \t  instrumental\n2. \tEndless Nights \t04:44 \t  Show lyrics\n3. \t(She's) Hot Tonight \t03:46 \t  Show lyrics\n4. \tThe Absinthe Voyage \t05:05 \t  Show lyrics\n5. \tLady of Perpetual Sorrow \t05:33 \t  Show lyrics\n6. \tThe Moonshine Years \t05:59 \t  Show lyrics\n7. \tNo Bet for Free \t04:37 \t  Show lyrics\n8. \tOn the Run Again \t04:42 \t  Show lyrics\n9. \tMistress in Madness \t05:07 \t  Show lyrics\n10. \tReaper on the Hunt \t04:07 \t  Show lyrics\n11. \tYou're Dead Now \t05:17 \t  Show lyrics\n12. \tÃƒËœL \t03:24 \t  Show lyrics\n  \t53:49 \t ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6594106c322ba565adf0f8cfff976cb32dd6f6b0","amp;dn":"Chrome+Division-Infernal+Rock+Eternal%28Limited+Edition%29+mp3+320k+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6594106c322ba565adf0f8cfff976cb32dd6f6b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,148,16,108,50,43,165,101,173,240,248,207,255,151,108,179,45,214,246,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
