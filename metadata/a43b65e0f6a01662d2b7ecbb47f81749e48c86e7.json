RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can. WinRAR&amp;#039;s main features include strong general and multimedia compression, the ability to process non-RAR archive formats, ZIP compression and decompression, support for long filenames, programmable self-extracting archives (SFX), repair of damaged archives, authenticity verification, embedded file comments, and encryption. Unicode is supported in archive filenames, allowing non-English filenames to be handled painlessly. You can manipulate the parameters of many archives at once and view a volume sequence as a single archive. WinRAR can convert other archive formats to RAR and search for specified text and files in archives.\n\nVersion 3.7 ncludes numerous Windows Vista compatibility changes. New CHM help format. Support of UDF file format frequently used in DVD ISO images. Unicode support for CD ISO images. More space for file names in progress windows. New command line options for self-extracting modules.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a43b65e0f6a01662d2b7ecbb47f81749e48c86e7","amp;dn":"WinRAR+3.70+Professional","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a43b65e0f6a01662d2b7ecbb47f81749e48c86e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,59,101,224,246,160,22,98,210,183,236,187,71,248,23,73,228,140,134,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
