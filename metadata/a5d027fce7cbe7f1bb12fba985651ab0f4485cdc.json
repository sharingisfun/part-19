It should be noted that the group of characters have not been called the Young Liars as of yet, but as the title suggests, all of them have disturbing secrets about themselves that they keep from the others, and even the readers are left to decide what is true and what are lies.\n\nThis torrent contains:\n\nYoung Liars 01-05 (2008) (Minutemen-LockeZone)\nYoung Liars 06-10 (2008) (Minutemen-DTs)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d027fce7cbe7f1bb12fba985651ab0f4485cdc","amp;dn":"Young+Liars+%231-10+%5BOngoing%5D+%28Minutemen%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d027fce7cbe7f1bb12fba985651ab0f4485cdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,208,39,252,231,203,231,241,187,18,251,169,133,101,26,176,244,72,92,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
