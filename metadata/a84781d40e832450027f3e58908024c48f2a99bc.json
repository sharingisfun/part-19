But what?s the point of having the Young Musician of the Year competition within hands reach, if those around you don?t even notice? Jal?s problem is her dad - he may be Bristol?s answer to P Diddy, but when it comes to his daughter he?s lost the plot. Sid has got a big problem of his own - a problem who goes by the name of Mad Twatter. Mad T won?t rest until he?s got his hands on his drugs, his money or Sid and, as usual, Tony has left his best mate to take it on the chin - literally.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.e4.com/skins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.e4.com/skins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.MySpace.com/e4skins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.MySpace.com/e4skins&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a84781d40e832450027f3e58908024c48f2a99bc","amp;dn":"Skins.S01E03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a84781d40e832450027f3e58908024c48f2a99bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,71,129,212,14,131,36,80,2,127,62,88,144,128,36,196,143,42,153,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
