Drummer Jimmy Cobb, tenor saxophonist George Coleman, bassist Ron Carter, and guitarist Mike Stern concentrate almost exclusively on the 1950s repertoire of Davis, excepting Ron Carter's somewhat abstract, R&amp;B-flavored &quot;81,&quot; which is from the mid-'60s. Stern's sparse accompaniment for Coleman in &quot;All Blues&quot; works surprising well in place of a piano, while the percolating take of &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot; will get a listener's feet patting. Coleman's soulful playing is the centerpiece of a lush treatment of &quot;Blue in Green.&quot; Carter and Cobb provide a superb foundation for the soloists throughout this live recording. The creativity and musicianship throughout this excellent tribute make it stand head and shoulders above most such efforts.
