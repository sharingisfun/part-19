Their musical style encompassed rock and roll and swamp rock genres. Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins, they positioned themselves as Southern rock stylists, singing often about bayous, the Mississippi River, catfish, and other popular elements of Southern iconography.\n\nCCR's music is still a staple of American and worldwide radio airplay[1] and often figures in various media. The band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone.[2] CCR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Concert 2009\n\n\nThe Concert is a live album by American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, released by Fantasy Records in October 1980.[1] The album was recorded at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California on the January 31, 1970.[2]\n\nOriginally the album was mistakenly titled The Royal Albert Hall Concert. Only later was it discovered that it was not recorded at the Royal Albert Hall, it was duly renamed for later reissues.[4]\n\nThe album reached #62 on the Billboard 200 in 1981.[5] The album achieved gold status (500,000 units sold) by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 27, 1986 and made platinum status (1,000,000 units sold) on September 30, 1996.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Born on the Bayou&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14\n2.\t&quot;Green River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n3.\t&quot;Tombstone Shadow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n4.\t&quot;Don't Look Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n5.\t&quot;Travelin' Band&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n6.\t&quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31\n7.\t&quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; 2:16\n8.\t&quot;Proud Mary&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n9.\t&quot;Fortunate Son&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:22\n10.\t&quot;Commotion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36\n11.\t&quot;The Midnight Special&quot; (Traditional, arr.
