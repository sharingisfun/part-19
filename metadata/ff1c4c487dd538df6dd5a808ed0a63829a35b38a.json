In a nutshell. A life that is brimming with longing for a sanctuary, for a place to wait for a love that sure will come some day. \n\nBut there is a new vibe going on, too, something we are not used from the shy young man with the long beard. Something is different on his third album. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾I came to terms with myselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ, explains Scott Matthew. He gained confidence and he understood that he has the right to lead a life away from the conservative norm. And that it is about time to tell the world by singing his songs. \n\nA song like No Place Called Hell is a good example for his progress ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as it is MatthewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ very own protest song against bigotry and intolerance, propelled by a mouth trumpet solo. Songs like Felicity, Devils`s Only Child and The Wonder Of Falling In Love carry a positive lightness new to the Australian expatriate. All in all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Gallantry's Favorite SonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ is more playful, more diverse and experimental than itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s predecessors. Yet the lyrics still revolve around his favourite topics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ love, the pain of seperation, loneliness ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ things Scott witnessed over and over again.\n\nAnd again there are plenty of goosebump moments. Sinking for example, ScottÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most personal song ever. Or when in Buried Alive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a song about a love that died and refuses to be buried - ghostly voices come into the foreground to create a creepy atmosphere. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾It's taken this song to expel the dirtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ, he whispers in True Sting, mourning about a lost love and creating a new place for his agony ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the song.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Gallantry's Favorite SonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ, whose old-fashioned title was chosen deliberately to emphasize ScottÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s organic and romantic approach to music, is the almagamation of his experiences since he released his debut album in 2008. His music is like a diary whose secrets he shares with an intimate circle of friends. A circle that is constantly growing. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾When friendship becomes family, it helps me with the mysteryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ, sings Matthew in his song Felicity and does not only mean his long time companions like producer Mike Skinner and muscians like Eugene Lemcio and Clara Kennedy, but also his fans and followers. Together it is easier to endure the daily crazyness, together it is easier to sustain hope.\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff1c4c487dd538df6dd5a808ed0a63829a35b38a","amp;dn":"Scott+Matthew...Gallantry%27s+Favorite+Son%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff1c4c487dd538df6dd5a808ed0a63829a35b38a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,28,76,72,125,213,56,223,109,213,168,8,237,10,99,130,154,53,179,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
