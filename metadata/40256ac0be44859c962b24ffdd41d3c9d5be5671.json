Indeed, Lennon would have flourished in the unplugged era, when the nakedness of his best lyrics and the cutting directness of his astonishing voice would have been in the fore. Since John never got around to doing an acoustic collection, the task has fallen to Yoko Ono, who's pulled together 16 skeletal Lennon tracks, including seven previously unreleased selections. Of particular note are riveting newly surfaced Plastic Ono Band demos of &quot;Well Well Well,&quot; &quot;God,&quot; and &quot;My Mummy's Dead,&quot; and a harsher-than-the-electric version of &quot;Cold Turkey.&quot; Three early '70s live recordings and a smattering of later demos flesh out the collection.
