After Freddy Fender, Flaco JimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nez, Kevin West,Cesar Chavez, Augie Meyers, Jorge &quot;Pac-MAN&quot; Diaz, and Doug Sahm performed in front of a San Francisco audience, they all knew the genuine bond they felt in their music could probably be taken to another level. After they initially performed as the Tex-Mex Revue, they took the title Texas Tornados, after Sahm's song and album of that name.\n\nAnother account of the group's birth says they formed when record company executives looking to cash in on regional music sales approached Sahm and Meyers around 1990, and they brought in longtime friends and collaborators Fender and JimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nez. Sahm had released albums under the name Texas Tornados as early as the 1970s, some featuring Fender or Meyers. JimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nez and Meyers played on Sahm's Atlantic Records debut in 1971. As Fender once said &quot;You've heard of New Kids on the Block?, we're the Old Guys in the Street&quot;.\n\nIndividually, this quartet has had major success. San Benito-native Freddy Fender was a cross-over success story around the world with hits like &quot;Before the Next Teardrop Falls&quot; and &quot;Wasted Days and Wasted Nights&quot;.\n\nFlaco JimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nez has played with acts ranging from the Rolling Stones to Dwight Yoakam. He also is known as the &quot;Father of Conjunto Music&quot; (Flaco plays the Conjunto accordion).\n\nAugie Meyers has shared the stage with the likes of The Allman Brothers Band and Bob Dylan. He's also a member of the Texas Music Hall of Fame. Doug Sahm and Augie Meyers were both members of the 1960s pop-rock band the Sir Douglas Quintet, with hits such as &quot;She's About a Mover&quot; and &quot;Mendocino&quot; to their credit. Sahm, Meyers and JimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nez are from the San Antonio area.\n\nThe band's 1990 debut was recorded in both English and Spanish versions. The Texas Tornados were asked to perform all over the world at places like the Presidential Inauguration of Bill Clinton, the Montreaux Jazz Festival, as well as regular appearances at Farm Aid and the Houston Livestock and Rodeo Show. They won a Grammy Award in 1990 for &quot;Best Mexican/American Performance.&quot;\n\nAmong their other albums is Live From The Limo, this was the last album to be recorded that featured the complete lineup, as Sahm died in 1999, the year of its release. Fender, who had health problems in later years, died in 2006. Their 2005 Live from Austin album was a recording of a 1990 performance on the TV series Austin City Limits.\n\nPeople sometimes refer to their lyrics as Spanglish because of the mixture of English and Spanish in the same song, in addition to pronouncing the Spanish lyrics in an American accent, which is evident in their hit, &quot;(Hey Baby) Que Paso&quot;. An example is the lyric: &quot;Don't you know I love you / and my corazÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n is real?&quot;, where the word corazÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n (Spanish for &quot;heart&quot;) is improperly pronounced /Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€™kÃƒâ€°Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½rÃƒâ€°Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã‹â€ soÃƒÅ Ã…Â n/, with an obvious American accent, instead of [koÃƒâ€°Ã‚Â¾aÃƒâ€¹Ã‹â€ son]. The band's self-titled debut album was offered in Spanish and English-language versions.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nAugie Meyers\nFlaco Jimenez\nShawn Sahm\nLouie Ortega\nErnie Durawa\nSpeedy Sparks\nMichael Guerra \nFreddy Fender \nDoug Sahm \n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n  1.
