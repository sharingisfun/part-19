I recorded it from TV to my VCR years ago, and then copied it to MP4 in July.\n\nI took awhile to clean up (Audio and Video quality was shit), but It looks and sounds good.\n\nHappy Anniversary to The Pirate Bay!\nDon't run out of duct tape.\n\n--SteRipper\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b02e76171718b5d893d6b05138d444fd4d940233","amp;dn":"Detective+School+Dropouts+%28TV%2FVCRrip%29+%28SteRipper%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b02e76171718b5d893d6b05138d444fd4d940233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,46,118,23,23,24,181,216,147,214,176,81,56,212,68,253,77,148,2,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
