That's what Lisa Caponigri believes, and she created Whatever Happened to Sunday Dinner? to give real families recipes they can easily cook and enjoy together. Caponigri has devised 52 delicious Italian menus--one for each Sunday of the year--that feature all the favorites, including classics like crostini, lasagne, polenta, stuffed peppers, veal piccata, risotto alla Milanese, and ricotta pie. There are also many surprises like Woodman's pasta and Italian french fries--and traditional, treasured dishes from her own family's kitchen, such as Nana's Strufoli and Grandma Caponigri's Ragu Sauce.\r\nBeautifully photographed by Guy Ambrosino, Whatever Happened to Sunday Dinner? showcases food styling by former Gourmet magazine editor Kate Winslow. \r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nWhen she was a young girl, Lisa Caponigri regularly traveled on extended research trips to Italy with her father, an internationally known professor of Italian philosophy. Then, on school vacations Caponigri's Sicilian grandmother invited her to spend time at her home, and under her grandmother's watchful eye Lisa mastered Italian home cooking. Later in life, Lisa moved to Italy to raise her family and continued to study Italian cuisine. Lisa now resides in South Bend, Indiana and dedicates herself to spreading the gospel of Italian cooking in America. \r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/hrm000odh/Whatever_Happened_to_Sunday_Dinner.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ebfec186152ebe6030ceca7b7233a64e133be6","amp;dn":"Whatever+Happened+to+Sunday+Dinner%3F+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ebfec186152ebe6030ceca7b7233a64e133be6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,235,254,193,134,21,46,190,96,48,206,202,123,114,51,166,78,19,59,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
