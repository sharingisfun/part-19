It is characterised by a long classically-inspired guitar solo and organ solo.Organist Jon Lord claimed that the organ and guitar solos were based on Bach-like chord sequences\n   This song was born on a tour bus going to Portsmouth in 1971 when a reporter asked the band how they wrote songs. To demonstrate, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore grabbed an acoustic guitar and began playing a riff consisting of a single &quot;G&quot; repeated over and over, while vocalist Ian Gillan improvised lyrics over the top. The song was refined and was performed that same night. The song first appears on the 1972 LP Machine Head. The track remains one of the band's staples in live concerts, and was the set opener even before it was released on any album. \n  The very first live version released, recorded live for German TV program Beat-Club in September 1971. The most famous live version is featured on the 1972 live album &quot;Made in Japan&quot;.The guitar solo would gain recognition when readers of Guitar World voted it #19 in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos \n  It's also the opening track on the live albums &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; (1988) and &quot;Come Hell or High Water (1994).
