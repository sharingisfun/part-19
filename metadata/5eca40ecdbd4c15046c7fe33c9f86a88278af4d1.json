Shaara\nPublished by Ballantine in 2013\nTags: fiction, history, american civil war, american history\nEPUB, 562 pages, English (0345527402)\n\nContinuing the trilogy that began with A Blaze of Glory, New York Times bestselling author Jeff Shaara returns to chronicle another decisive chapter in America's long and bloody Civil War. In A Chain of Thunder, the action shifts to the fortress city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. There, in the vaunted &quot;Gibraltar of the Confederacy,&quot; a siege for the ages will cement the reputation of one Union general--and all but seal the fate of the rebel cause.\n\nIn May 1863, after months of hard and bitter combat, Union troops under the command of Major General Ulysses S. Grant at long last successfully cross the Mississippi River. They force the remnants of Confederate Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton's army to retreat to Vicksburg, burning the bridges over the Big Black River in its path. But after sustaining heavy casualties in two failed assaults against the rebels, Union soldiers are losing confidence and morale is low.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eca40ecdbd4c15046c7fe33c9f86a88278af4d1","amp;dn":"A+Chain+of+Thunder+by+Jeff+Shaara.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eca40ecdbd4c15046c7fe33c9f86a88278af4d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,202,64,236,219,212,193,80,70,199,254,51,201,248,106,136,39,138,244,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
