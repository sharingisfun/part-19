The parts of the parents were ideal for veteran stage and screen icons Diane LeBlanc(now a respectable director) and the ever popular Chris Wiggins. The child actor Ricky O'Neill played Franz starred in the TV film &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; with Wiggins three years earlier. The other two child actors are virtual unknowns but will stay forever young(albeit forever marooned)thanks to syndication. The plots were certainly hackneyed with danger every episode but the charm of this series is undeniable and is a throwback to the days when TV series were actually made for children.\n\n\nNOTE: After Pack 1 Of 2 Is Well Seeded Pack 2 Of 2 Will Be Uploaded.\n\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1c346156ac7a92ca895a483b55b0b610fc282e6","amp;dn":"Swiss+Family+Robinson+%281976%29+%28PACK+1+OF+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1c346156ac7a92ca895a483b55b0b610fc282e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,195,70,21,106,199,169,44,168,149,164,131,181,91,11,97,15,194,130,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
