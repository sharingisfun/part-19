It was released on January 22, 2008 in the United States. Recorded during and after the acoustic Dirt Underneath Tour, the album features a more stripped down, and country based sound not seen since their sophomore release Pizza Deliverance. The album's title is taken from a line in a Mike Cooley song entitled &quot;Checkout Time in Vegas&quot;. Wes Freed once again provided the album artwork. According to guitarist Patterson Hood, the band's decision on the name of the album was greatly influenced by the Freed's artwork. Hood also said that the album was recorded with much ease and did not require compromises. The album was released as both a compact disc as well as a double vinyl.\n\n&quot;Two Daughters and a Beautiful Wife&quot; is about Bryan Harvey, singer-guitarist for a number of indie bands, most notably House of Freaks. On New Years Day 2006, Bryan and his family were found brutally murdered in the basement of their home. \n\nIn Sweden it charted at #37 on the official albums chart. The album also peaked at #37 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States.\n\nThe band embarked on a world-wide tour entitled &quot;The Home Front Tour&quot; throughout the entirety of 2008 in support of Brighter Than Creation's Dark.\n\n[320k MP3]  \n\n  01. &quot;Two Daughters and a Beautiful Wife&quot; (Hood)\n  02. &quot;3 Dimes Down&quot; (Cooley)\n  03. &quot;The Righteous Path&quot; (Hood)\n  04. &quot;I'm Sorry Huston&quot; (Tucker)\n  05. &quot;Perfect Timing&quot; (Cooley)\n  06. &quot;Daddy Needs a Drink&quot; (Hood)\n  07. &quot;Self Destructive Zones&quot; (Cooley)\n  08. &quot;Bob&quot; (Cooley)\n  09. &quot;Home Field Advantage&quot; (Tucker)\n  10. &quot;Opening Act&quot; (Hood)\n  11. &quot;Lisa's Birthday&quot; (Cooley)\n  12. &quot;The Man I Shot&quot; (Hood)\n  13. &quot;Purgatory Line&quot; (Tucker)\n  14. &quot;The Home Front&quot; (Hood)\n  15. &quot;Checkout Time in Vegas&quot; (Cooley)\n  16. &quot;You and Your Crystal Meth&quot; (Hood)\n  17. &quot;Goode's Field Road&quot; (Hood)\n  18. &quot;A Ghost to Most&quot; (Cooley)\n  19. &quot;Monument Valley&quot; (Hood)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3262dfc850ca69cb6e9bb6e4e5e11c8626ab6b72","amp;dn":"Drive+By+Truckers+-+%5C%27Brighter+Than+Creation%5C%27s+Dark%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3262dfc850ca69cb6e9bb6e4e5e11c8626ab6b72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,98,223,200,80,202,105,203,110,155,182,228,229,225,28,134,38,171,107,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
