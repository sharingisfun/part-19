But the forces of the &quot;New Morality&quot;, the coalition of censorious do-gooders who run 21st-century America, have other plans for him. To his distress, Grant is torn from his young bride and sent to a research station in orbit around Jupiter, charged with the task of spying on the scientists who work there. What they don't know is that his loyalty to science may be greater than his loyalty to &quot;The New Morality&quot;. But that loyalty will be tested in a mission as dangerous as any ever undertaken. \n\n\n\nRead by Christian Noble, David Warner\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nLength: 12 hrs and 55 mins\nSeries: Grand Tour (Bova), Book 10\nRelease Date:05-06-05\nPublisher: Macmillan Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b99514662a50c27b90bf5cd5edc5bfb47d265843","amp;dn":"Ben+Bova+-+Jupiter+%28The+Grand+Tour+%2310%29+%5BAUDIBLE+RIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b99514662a50c27b90bf5cd5edc5bfb47d265843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,149,20,102,42,80,194,123,144,191,92,213,237,197,191,180,125,38,88,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
