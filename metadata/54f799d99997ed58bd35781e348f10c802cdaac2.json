Pop singer/pianist Norah Jones was a member before her break-out album Come Away with Me. Other former members include N&amp;#039;dea Davenport and Saul Williams. Jones can still be heard singing with them on two tracks of their 2004 release, NuBlu Sessions. Current members are Thor Madsen (guitar and beats), Jesse Murphy (bass), Jochen Rueckert (drums), and Marla Turner (vocals).\n\nThe newest CD, Copenhagen, was just released November 7, 2006 and the sound has been compared by Amazon.com to Garbage. Part of a three part series, this CD is followed up with &quot;Istanbul&quot; and &quot;Brasil&quot;.\n\n\nThe New York trip-hop outfit Wax Poetic came together in 1997 under the reign of Turkish-born music guru Ilhan Ersahin who is still a current member (tenor and keys). The group originated at the popular and now-defunct club Save the Robots, and consisted of a volatile group of musicians jamming together to create a heavy groove of drum &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; bass blended with quick dance elements. Ersahin and company signed to Atlantic in the latter &amp;#039;90s and released their debut self-titled album in June 2000.\n\nIlhan, Thor, and Jochen combined with Erik Truffaz and Matt Penman to create the band Our Theory.\n\n\n\nIstanbul Album Tracklist :\n\n1-) Cihangir\n2-) Hoppala\n3-) Morning Prayer\n4-) Istanbul Lighthouse\n5-) Keyif - The Relaxed Minute\n6-) Striptease In Istanbul\n7-) Their Mood\n8-) Istanbul Can Be Dub\n9-) Var Da\n10-) Saints\n11-) Dreamland\n12-) Calling Our Gods\n13-) Cihangir (Breanman Green Remix)\n\nYear:2006\nGenre : Jazz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f799d99997ed58bd35781e348f10c802cdaac2","amp;dn":"Wax+Poetic+-+Istanbul+%28Jazz+FLAC+Turkey%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f799d99997ed58bd35781e348f10c802cdaac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,247,153,217,153,151,237,88,189,53,120,30,52,143,16,200,2,205,170,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
