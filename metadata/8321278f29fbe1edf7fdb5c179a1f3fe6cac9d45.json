Every discipline of science is coming &quot;full circle&quot; back to what the Bible has said all along. This collection of studies includes:\n\nBeyond Time and Space The startling discovery of modern science is that our physical universe is actually finite.\n\nBeyond Coincidence  The slightest change in any one of many variables prevents life.\n\nBeyond Perception The implication of quantum mechanics is frightening to secular scientists.\n\nBeyond Newton The interaction of the heavenly bodies cannot be explained by gravity.\n\nInclude notes in PDF format and MP3 files.\n\n\nBeyond Newton:\n\nHow can a star, distant from us, gravitationally affect our Sun?\n\nWhere is the missing 95% of matter in the universe?\n\nDo dark matter and, even, black holes really exist?\n\nAstronomers explain their views relying on the 17th and 18th century tools of their forefathers, Kepler and Newton: gravity, fluid mechanics, and the magnetism of loadstone, rather than those of the 19th century - James Clerk Maxwell and electromagnetic field theory. Beyond Newton explores the challenges to current astronomy by scientists who have discovered that the entire volume of our galaxy is filled with diffuse clouds of magnetized plasma - electrically charged ionized particles.\n\nThis briefing pack contains 2 hours of teachings\n\n\nBeyond Perception:\n\nWhy do scientists now believe we live in a 10-dimensional universe?\n\nHas physics finally reached the very boundaries of reality?\n\nThere seems to be evidence to suggest that our world and everything in it are only ghostly images: projections from a level of reality so beyond our own that the real reality is literally beyond both space and time. The main architect of this astonishing idea is one of the world's most eminent thinkers- physicist David Bohm, a protege of Einstein's. Earlier, he noticed that, in plasmas, particles stopped behaving like individuals and started behaving as if they were part of a larger and inter connected whole. He continued his work in the behavior of oceans of these particles, noting their behaving as if they know what each on the untold trillions of individual particles were doing.\n\nThis briefing pack contains 2 hours of teachings\n\n\nBeyond Coincidence:\n\nIs our universe some kind of cosmic accident, or is it the result of careful and skillful design?\n\nWhat do scientists mean by &quot;The Anthropic Principle&quot;?\n\nWhen compiling the many physical and mathematical subtleties which make up our universe, scientist have discovered that a slight variation in any of them militates against the existence of life. Even at the atomic and sub-atomic level, the slightest variation in any of the primary constants of physics - some as sensitive as one part in over 1,000,000 - cause life to be impossible. Even secular science refers to these appearances of apparent design as the &quot;anthropic principle,&quot; since they yield the impression that the universe was designed specifically for man.\n\n\nThis briefing pack contains 2 hours of teachings\n\n\n\nBeyond Space and Time:\n\nAre there more than four dimensions to physical reality?\nIs it possible to traverse time as well as space?\nIs there a reality beyond our traditional concepts of time and space?\n\nThe startling discovery of modern science is that our physical universe is actually finite. Scientists now acknowledge that the universe had a beginning. They call the singularity from which it all began the &quot;Big Bang.&quot;\n\nWhile the detail among the many variants of these theories remain quite controversial, the fact that there was a definite beginning has gained widespread agreement. This is, of course, what the Bible has maintained throughout its 66 books.\n\nThis briefing pack contains 2 hours of teachings\n\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.  \n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;                                                       Free online Bible Study &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt;                                                            End Times Prophecy - Who is Babylon the Great\n                                                                                Listen to Alex Jones   Secular Truth &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                               Daily Bible Study in Your Email &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                         Chuck Missler - Africa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&lt;/a&gt;                                                       Chuck Missler - USA &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.efoodsdirect.com/winter/?ait=13&amp;adit=79&lt;/a&gt;                                       Dehydrated Survival Food -  Excellent Taste &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&lt;/a&gt;          Chuck Missler - New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Rim\n \n\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
