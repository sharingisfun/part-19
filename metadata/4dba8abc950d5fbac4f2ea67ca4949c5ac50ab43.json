This solo Riverside set (reissued by OJC on CD) as usual finds Lewis generally sticking to the blues (with &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; and &quot;Fate&quot; being exceptions), mostly performing originals. On a few of the songs Lewis switches effectively to celeste. It apparently only took Meade Lux Lewis two hours to record the full set and the results are quite spontaneous yet well organized, a fine all-around portrait of the veteran pianist in his later period. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Hammer Chatter\n02 - You Were Meant for Me\n03 - Celeste Bounce\n04 - Bear Trap Stomp\n05 - Frompy Stomp\n06 - Rough Seas\n07 - Madame Vod's Celeste Blues\n08 - C-Jam Blues\n09 - Fate\n10 - Breezing at the Celeste\n\nEnjoy and share!
