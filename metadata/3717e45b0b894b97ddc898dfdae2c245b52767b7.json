Michael Norman, a former New York Times reporter, and Elizabeth Norman (Women at War) pen a gripping narrative of the 1942 battle for the Bataan peninsula in the Philippines, the surrender of 76,000 Americans and Filipinos to the Japanese and the infamous death march that introduced the captives to the starvation, dehydration and murderous Japanese brutality that would become routine for the next three years. Focusing intermittently on American POW Ben Steele, whose sketches adorn the book, the narrative follows the prisoners through the hell of Japanese prison and labor camps. (The lowest circle is the suffocating prison ship where men went mad with thirst and battened on their comrades' blood.) The authors are unsparing but sympathetic in telling the Japanese side of the story; indeed, they are much harder on the complacent, arrogant American commander Douglas MacArthur than on his Japanese counterpart. There's sorrow but not much pity in this story; as all human aspiration shrivels to a primal obsession with food and water, flashes of compassion and artistic remembrance only occasionally light the gloom. 8 pages of b&amp;w illus., illus. throughout; maps.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3717e45b0b894b97ddc898dfdae2c245b52767b7","amp;dn":"Tears+In+The+Darkness+-+Michael+Norman++%28World+War+II+-+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3717e45b0b894b97ddc898dfdae2c245b52767b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,23,228,91,11,137,75,151,221,200,152,223,218,226,194,69,181,39,103,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
