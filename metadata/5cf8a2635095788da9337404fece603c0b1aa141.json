C. McKeown - A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities: Strange Tales and Surprising Facts from the World's Greatest Empire\nPublished: 2010-06-01 | ISBN: 0195393759 | PDF | 272 pages | 5 MB\n\nHere is a whimsical and captivating collection of odd facts, strange beliefs, outlandish opinions, and other highly amusing trivia of the ancient Romans. We tend to think of the Romans as a pragmatic people with a ruthlessly efficient army, an exemplary legal system, and a precise and elegant language. A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities shows that the Romans were equally capable of bizarre superstitions, logic-defying customs, and often hilariously derisive views of their fellow Romans and non-Romans.\nClassicist J. C. McKeown has organized the entries in this entertaining volume around major themes--The Army, Women, Religion and Superstition, Family Life, Medicine, Slaves, Spectacles--allowing for quick browsing or more deliberate consumption. Among the book's many gems are:\nÃ‚Â· Romans on urban living:\nThe satirist Juvenal lists &quot;fires, falling buildings, and poets reciting in August as hazards to life in Rome.&quot; \nÃ‚Â· On enhanced interrogation:\n&quot;If we are obliged to take evidence from an arena-fighter or some other such person, his testimony is not to be believed unless given under torture.&quot; (Justinian) \nÃ‚Â· On dreams:\nDreaming of eating books &quot;foretells advantage to teachers, lecturers, and anyone who earns his livelihood from books, but for everyone else it means sudden death&quot;\nÃ‚Â· On food:\n&quot;When people unwittingly eat human flesh, served by unscrupulous restaurant owners and other such people, the similarity to pork is often noted.&quot; (Galen)\nÃ‚Â· On marriage:\nIn ancient Rome a marriage could be arranged even when the parties were absent, so long as they knew of the arrangement, &quot;or agreed to it subsequently.&quot;\nÃ‚Â· On health care:\nPliny caustically described medical bills as a &quot;down payment on death,&quot; and Martial quipped that &quot;Diaulus used to be a doctor, now he's a mortician. He does as a mortician what he did as a doctor.&quot;\nFor anyone seeking an inglorious glimpse at the underside of the greatest empire in history, A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities offers endless delights.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cf8a2635095788da9337404fece603c0b1aa141","amp;dn":"A+Cabinet+of+Roman+Curiosities+-+Strange+Tales+and+Surprising+Fa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cf8a2635095788da9337404fece603c0b1aa141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,248,162,99,80,149,120,141,169,51,116,4,254,206,96,60,11,26,161,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
