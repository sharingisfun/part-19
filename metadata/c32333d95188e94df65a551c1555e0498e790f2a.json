Once again, the programs are hosted by OscarÃ‚Â®-award winner Susan Sarandon.\n\nIn Mythos I: The Shaping of Our Mythic Tradition, Campbell began by looking at the world's most ancient myths and symbols, from the evolution of human consciousness to the prehistoric hunting plains to the civilizations of the Fertile Crescent and the classical world.\n\nIn Mythos II: The Shaping of the Eastern Tradition, he went on to explore these basic elements as they have expressed themselves in the great religions and philosophies of Asia.\n\nNow, in Mythos III: The Shaping of the Western Tradition, he moves on to exploring these same mythological motifs as they have expressed themselves in Western culture. Where the emphasis in the previous programs has been on the evolution of the human species and cultures, now Campbell focusses on the artists, writers and thinkers who have had such a huge impact on the culture of the modern West.\n\nOver half of this series is made up of material that has never been released in any form.\n\n----------------------------------------Ã‚Â­------------------\nMYTHOS I - The Shaping of Our Mythic Tradition\n280 min.
