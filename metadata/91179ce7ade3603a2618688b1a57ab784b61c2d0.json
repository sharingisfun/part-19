A first for the franchise, the 3-D riddle screens allow players to navigate through 360-degree and 180-degree environments -- searching above, under and between objects. The game delivers 10 distinctly diverse beautiful locations and 40 riddles that are actively solved. As the player solves more riddles, a mysterious machine slowly evolves and reveals its true form. Ultimately, the players will reach the pulse-pounding climactic ending that will have them breaking a sweat in a race against the clock to perform a series of intense movements and reveal a special surprise. Additionally, Ultimate I SPY features a Game Room with 10 mini-games, complete with multiplayer options.  \n\n\nNOTE: To play this game you need a chipped or soft modded Wii.\n\nTo install &amp; play off disc:\n1.
