As blasting an indictment of suburban anomie as has ever appeared on record, the collection is serious, sarcastic, cutting and contains a number of indisputably great tracks: the mock-Western fatalism of Living on Borrowed Time, the quiet insistence of You're Gonna Need Somebody, the wry humour of the title track, the shattering beauty of Two Lonely Hearts, the gutwrenching plaintiveness of Sisters -- the hardest song on this album to listen to -- and the more conciliatory, dreamlike coda Traces of My Love. Forget the jaunty Georgie On The Spree, which wasn't on the original release of this album and doesn't belong here, thematically or musically -- Sunnyvista is an uncompromisingly tough recording, but achieves true depth and emotional resonance through its musical accomplishment. Great guitar work, as always, great vocals from Linda in particular (she dominates the second half), and fine contributions from the likes of Gerry Rafferty. An album to rediscover.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2423622ad73e39296f74eccae7cdf9b87499952","amp;dn":"Richard+and+Linda+Thompson+%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Sunnyvista+%5B1979%5D%5BEAC%2Clo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2423622ad73e39296f74eccae7cdf9b87499952","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,66,54,34,173,115,227,146,150,247,78,204,174,124,223,155,135,73,153,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
