A Passed Life you can tell Y2JÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influences were all over that song and his love of Iron Maiden. I really dug the song a lot. Jericho and crew start this whole cd off with a song called Spider in my mouth which set a good pace for this cd. From the opening riffs that are so heavy, and the hooky chorus. This song just shifts from heavy to melodic so much that you are not sure what will happen next in the sound, which listening to this cd is the normal for them. Sandpaper is the next track, and it is very commercial and you almost feel Rich Ward is so held back that he wanted to let loose more on that song which he almost got to in the middle. But, Jericho shines on songs that really lets him belt out his screams and catchy choruses.\nJust in case you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already know, Chris Jericho, the lead singer of Fozzy, successfully combines his role as rock god with that of a multi time belt holder in WWE.\n\nIs he just a case of jack of all trades, or is actually rather good at multi-tasking?\n\nFrom the start of FozzyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, which was always treated as a bit of a joke (like most wrestlers secondary careers are)Jerichohas had the brilliance of Rich HallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar work backing him up, which has always given the band a certain amount of credibility and authenticity. This is fairly lucky, because vocallyJerichodoes seem to have quite a range on him. From 80s style hair rock melodic scale tripping, to Children of Bodom-esqe growling he pretty much covers all bases.\nFile Name Size\n2012 Sin And Bones/01- Spider In My Mouth.mp3 11.03 MB\n2012 Sin And Bones/02- Sandpaper (Feat M.
