For &quot;Beach Baby&quot; -- a slice of richly harmonic pop in the mold of classic Beach Boys -- the duo enlisted the services of singer Tony Burrows, the voice of other pre-fab hitmakers including the Edison Lighthouse (&quot;Love Grows [Where My Rosemary Goes]&quot;), White Plains (&quot;My Baby Loves Lovin'&quot;), the Brotherhood of Man (&quot;United We Stand&quot;) and the Pipkins (&quot;Gimme Dat Ding&quot;); upon its release in 1974, the single reached the Top Five on the U.S. pop charts and also scored in the U.K. A self-titled album and follow-up singles including &quot;Dreams Are Ten a Penny&quot; and &quot;Funny How Love Can Be&quot; tanked, however, and after releasing a second LP, The First Class SST, Carter and Lewis dissolved the project in 1976.\n\nTaken from &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:39fexqy5ldae~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:39fexqy5ldae~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
