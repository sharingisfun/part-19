This trio built this band from the ruins of heavy metal band Trojan Warrior. The musical direction of this members moved more to doom metal, which was very strong style in the middle of 90&amp;#039;s. The early beginnings were signed by looking for the right people to complete the line-up. And therefore there were often personal changes. In the beginning of the summer 1996 enter the band female vocalist Sona Witch Kozakova.\nIn this 4-member line-up GALADRIEL recorded their first promo CD in August 1996. The keyboards were recorded by friendly King (in that time the member of Lunatic Gods). In autumnal days enter the band the rhythm guitarist Chulo Malachovsky. With his help band wrote next three songs and recorded them in January 1997. In that time Unknown Territory (a new small british label) offer the contract for GALADRIEL. So, both recordings were completed and finaly released in September 1997 as a debut CD called &quot;Empire Of Emptiness&quot;.\n\nmore on: http://www.galadriel.sk/web/content/band.htm\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf80dc8e6345503e4a76c6b0d2107d0bdd58dba0","amp;dn":"Galadriel+-+Discography+%281997-2007%29+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf80dc8e6345503e4a76c6b0d2107d0bdd58dba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,128,220,142,99,69,80,62,74,118,198,176,210,16,125,11,221,88,219,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
