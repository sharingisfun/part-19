Kennedy was killed in 1963, America became deeply\ninvolved in the Vietnam War. Within a few short years, heroin addiction in America\nreached epidemic proportions. In the background, Israel expanded its borders by force\nand became a colonial empire ruling a nation of hostile Palestinian subjects. This\nbook reveals how Israel exploited the Western powersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ long history of opium\ntrafficking as a means of toppling the young American president. The following\npoints summarize the information presented:\n\u0001 Opium was the glue that held together the rivaling factions that conspired to\nkill JFK.\n\u0001 The main factions in the conspiracy were Zionist instigators, the American\nMafia (headed by Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky and his lieutenant, Santo\nTrafficante), French-Corsican crime syndicates in Marseilles, France and\nSoutheast Asia, and the US military.\n\u0001 Heroin smuggling was first introduced to the American Mafia in the 1920s by\nJewish gangsters such as Meyer Lansky, &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond, and &quot;Dutch&quot;\nSchultz.\n\u0001 One of the reasons President Johnson escalated US involvement in Southeast\nAsia was because the American Mafia and French-Corsican heroin traffickers\nneeded a new source of opium for their heroin factories. Turkey had been the\nmain source, but its government was about to eradicate opium production.\n\u0001 Joseph Kennedy, SrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s three sons were viewed as a new American dynasty that\nthreatened IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plans to expand its borders. The Kennedy Dynasty would\nlast until 1985 if each son served two terms in the White House. It is widely\nknown that Joseph Kennedy Sr developed a strong loathing of Jews from his\nbusiness dealings with them in finance, Hollywood, and politics.\n\u0001 A decree was issued to kill JFK by Nahum Goldmann, founder of the World\nJewish Congress and its president in 1963.\n\u0001 Louis Bloomfield of Montreal was assigned to set up the coup dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tat. He was\nan influential international lawyer with an extensive espionage background\n(e.g., British intelligence, Haganah, OSS, CIA).\n\u0001 Martin Agronsky and other Jewish journalists and media moguls collaborated\nin the plot by pushing a false cover story that Lee Harvey Oswald alone killed\nJFK.\n\u0001 Right-wing extremists joined the coup initially but broke ranks and declared a\nholy war against Jews immediately after JFK was killed.\n\u0001 The assassins were the lieutenants of French-Corsican heroin trafficker and\nconvicted Nazi collaborator, Auguste Joseph Ricord. He was living in\nArgentina at the time of the assassination. Later he moved to Paraguay which\nbecame a major hub for smuggling heroin into the United States.\n\u0001 The assassins were Lucien Sarti, FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Chiappe, and Jean-Paul AngelettiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nall French-Corsicans.\n\u0001 Nixon was driven from office because he destroyed RicordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heroin cartel,\nestablished dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tente with the Soviet Union, withdrew forces from Vietnam, and\nended the draft.\n2\n\u0001 Under NixonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s orders, police in Mexico City tried to arrest Lucien SartiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the\nman who fatally shot JFK in the head. When Sarti fled, Mexican police\nopened fire. He died in a hail of bullets on April 27, 1972.\n\u0001 JFK made enemies within the military establishment and Israel when he\nattempted to establish dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tente with the Soviet Union in the summer of 1963.\nHe also wanted to prevent Israel from acquiring the Bomb.\n\u0001 JFK was viewed as a threat to Israel because of pro-Hitler statements he wrote\nin his 1945 diary (later published) and two books: Why England Slept and\nProfiles in Courage.\n\u0001 President Johnson aggressively supported Israel because he and his wife were\nsecretly Jewish.\n\u0001 TexasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a former Spanish colonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½became a haven for Sephardic Jews\nexpelled from Spain in 1492. Jewish migration continued from other countries\nin the 19th and 20th Centuries.\nOnce Kennedy was out of the way, President Johnson began to shift AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nforeign policy dramatically. First of all, he increased military forces in South Vietnam\nfrom 16,000 non-combat advisors to over 500,000 draftees by the time he left office\nin January 1969. Secondly, he joined America and Israel at the hip by increasing\nfinancial and military aid and becoming its ally during the Six Day War, an\naggressive land-grab that was immediately labeled illegal by the United Nations per\nResolutions 242 and later 338. Since then, one president after another has given Israel\nvirtually everything it wants. During KennedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last year in office, in 1963, the\nUnited States provided a mere $40 million per year to Israel. Within only two years,\nPresident Johnson had increased that amount to $130 million per year, over three\ntimes KennedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s allowance. Most of the Johnson money was for military buildup.\nSince KennedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death, the annual subsidy to Israel has grown into the billions\n(presently about $3 billion per year), but the Johnson administration marked a true\nturning point.1 In fact, American aid to Israel has far exceeded the total US payments\nto reconstruct postwar Europe under the Marshall Plan.2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9eec6b47f23dd06d3b968ab524dde807100b3f3","amp;dn":"Israel%2C+the+Golden+Triangle+and+the+Kennedy+assassination","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9eec6b47f23dd06d3b968ab524dde807100b3f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,238,198,180,127,35,221,6,211,185,104,171,82,77,222,128,113,0,179,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
