Standout tracks include &quot;Great Springwaters Of America&quot;, &quot;My Buffalo Song&quot; and &quot;It's Been A Long Day&quot;. Also, don't miss the bonus track hidden at the end of the CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:976b255c390b6dd8012c933482f2e00ebe770fef","amp;dn":"Harvester+-+Me+Climb+Mountain+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"976b255c390b6dd8012c933482f2e00ebe770fef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,107,37,92,57,11,109,216,1,44,147,52,130,242,224,14,190,119,15,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
