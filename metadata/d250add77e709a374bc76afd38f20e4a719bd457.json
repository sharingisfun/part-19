In Tammet's world, numbers are beautiful and mathematics illuminates our lives and minds. Using anecdotes and everyday examples, Tammet allows us to share his unique insights and delight in the way numbers, fractions and equations underpin all our lives.\nInspired by the complexity of snowflakes, Anne Boleyn's sixth finger or his mother's unpredictable behaviour, Tammet explores questions such as why time seems to speed up as we age, whether there is such a thing as an average person and how we can make sense of those we love.\nThinking in Numbers will change the way you think about maths and fire your imagination to see the world with fresh eyes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d250add77e709a374bc76afd38f20e4a719bd457","amp;dn":"Thinking_in_Numbers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d250add77e709a374bc76afd38f20e4a719bd457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,80,173,215,126,112,154,55,75,199,106,253,56,242,14,74,113,155,212,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
