He was the architect and founding father of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its establishment in 1949, and held authoritarian control over the nation until his death in 1976. His theoretical contribution to MarxismÃ¢â‚¬â€œLeninism, along with his military strategies and brand of policies, are collectively known as Maoism.\n\nMao rose to power by commanding the Long March, forming a Second United Front with Nationalists during the Second Sino-Japanese War to repel a Japanese invasion and defeat conspiring regional warlords, and leading the Communist Party of China (CPC) to victory against Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang (KMT) in the Chinese Civil War. After solidifying the reunification of China through his Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, Mao enacted sweeping land reform, by using violence and terror to overthrow the feudal landlords before seizing their large estates and dividing the land into people's communes. During the years when Mao was ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 'Great Helmsman', a range of positive changes came to China. These included promoting the status of women, improving popular literacy, doubling the school population, providing universal housing, abolishing unemployment and inflation, increasing health care access, and dramatically raising life expectancy. In addition, China's population almost doubled during the period of Mao's leadership (from around 550 to over 900 million).[3][5] As a result, Mao is still officially held in high regard by many in China as a great political strategist, military mastermind, and savior of the nation. Maoists further promote his role as a theorist, statesman, poet, and visionary, while anti-revisionists continue to defend most of his policies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e16f38fc905e55723ff42da7d721982c4198eeb4","amp;dn":"Mao+Tse+Tung+%28Mao+Zedong%29+-+Biography+Channel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e16f38fc905e55723ff42da7d721982c4198eeb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,111,56,252,144,94,85,114,63,244,45,167,215,33,152,44,65,152,238,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
