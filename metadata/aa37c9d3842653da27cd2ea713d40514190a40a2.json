Louis explores the effects this is having on the patients' lives and the consequences for their loved ones when drinking loses the social aspect and becomes a potentially fatal compulsion.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to know why people become addicted to alcohol and why it is impossible for some to stop drinking, even when it is killing them. To outsiders it may seem like an easy decision but it is nowhere near that simple. Louis spends time with patients and their families as they struggle to find a way out of their addiction to alcohol before it's too late.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 359 MiB\r\nDuration : 58mn 49s\r\nOverall bit rate : 852 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : HEVC\r\nBit rate : 756 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 10 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa37c9d3842653da27cd2ea713d40514190a40a2","amp;dn":"BBC+Louis+Theroux+Drinking+to+Oblivion+720p+x265+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa37c9d3842653da27cd2ea713d40514190a40a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,55,201,211,132,38,83,218,39,205,46,167,19,212,5,20,25,10,64,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
