Comprised of brothers Sam (drums), Pete (vocals, guitar), and Joe Loeffler (bass), the band began playing parties and outdoor events, which quickly led to bookings at Chicago clubs when youngest member Joe was just 14 years old. In 1999, Chevelle released their Steve Albini-produced debut album, Point #1, on Squint Entertainment. Three years later -- and following tours with bands like Filter, Sevendust, Powerman 5000, and Machine Head -- the band had inked a deal with Epic and issued Wonder What's Next, released in August 2002. The album went platinum by the following summer, propelled in part by its second single, &quot;Send the Pain Below,&quot; which became a number one hit on modern rock and mainstream radio. Main stage dates with the annual Ozzfest tour followed that summer, and 2003 brought a concert album, Live from the Road.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4976e2212033f809bf4349fca75716caf71cbaf3","amp;dn":"Chevelle+-+La+G%26aacute%3Brgola+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4976e2212033f809bf4349fca75716caf71cbaf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,118,226,33,32,51,248,9,191,67,73,252,167,87,22,202,247,28,186,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
