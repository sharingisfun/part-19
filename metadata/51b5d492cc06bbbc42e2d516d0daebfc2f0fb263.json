Of the five points of CalvinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“TULIP,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ four are unscriptural heresies. This work is not a blanket condemnation of all Calvinists, but in it, Dr. Ruckman does examine the false teachings involved in CalvinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s views of Total Depravity, Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement, and Irresistible Grace. As in all his works, Dr. Ruckman will give you what the Scriptures say in such matters and not merely what they are presumed to teach. He will show you how CalvinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s system is one of religious philosophy and not Biblical theology.\n\nMore &quot;Why I am not...&quot; books in the Peter Ruckman Collection on TPB.\n\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b5d492cc06bbbc42e2d516d0daebfc2f0fb263","amp;dn":"Why+I+Am+Not+A+Calvinist+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b5d492cc06bbbc42e2d516d0daebfc2f0fb263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,181,212,146,204,6,187,188,66,226,213,22,208,218,235,252,47,15,178,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
