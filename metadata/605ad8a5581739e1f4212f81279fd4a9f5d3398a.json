Frankly, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure he gives a damn who wins.\n\nAs the not-so-good Reverend tangles with a Lovecraftian horror and joins a renegade named Flower to battle a horde of cannibalistic fiends, only this is certain: MercerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blasphemous journey is laced with relentless action, terrifying evil, and nonstop humor.\n\nThis supernatural epic of the Old West that never was will leave you heartily cheering for the good guysÃ¢â‚¬â€if you can just figure out who the good guys are.
