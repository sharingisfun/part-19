We have removed several features that are not needed for the operating system to function (and that no one uses) to make this a very small installation disc.\n\nUsing nLite, we have integrated the product key into the setup, so you will not need to insert a product key during installation. Also, if in the event that it tells you that the product key is not valid, and you cannot continue, please download and use nLite (http://www.nliteos.com) to change or remove the integrated product key.\n\n\nThis copy is fully updated with SP4, including the SP4 Roll-Up update. The only updates we have not integrated are the Windows Media Player Updates.\n\n\n\nThis disc comes in ISO (Disc Image) format, so you will need to use an ISO burning program. Try nLite or Nero.\n\n\nTEST IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE SUCH AS VIRTUALBOX BEFORE BURNING TO A BLANK DISC\n\n\n\nSanctus Security (2/13/2011)\nTorrent Compiled By:  CyberFerret32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08ee6bed3a7075811c32ff1e95549c7ccb941f7a","amp;dn":"Windows+2000+Professional+%28SP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08ee6bed3a7075811c32ff1e95549c7ccb941f7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,238,107,237,58,112,117,129,28,50,255,30,149,84,156,124,203,148,31,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
