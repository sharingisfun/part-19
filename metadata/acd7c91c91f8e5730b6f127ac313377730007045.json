First recorded in 1982 by Roger Whittaker, then a country music hit for Gary Morris in 1983, it was covered six years later by Bette Midler. Morris' original was a Top Ten country hit, and it won the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association Song of the Year awards that year. Midler's was a Number One Billboard Hot 100 hit which also won her a Grammy Award in 1990.\n\n&quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; was performed by Bette Midler for the soundtrack of the film Beaches and became a U.S. number-one single. It was named Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1990.\n\nBette Midler (born December 1, 1945) is an American singer, actress and comedian, also known (by her informal stage name) as The Divine Miss M. During her more than forty year career, she has been nominated for two Academy Awards; and won four Grammy Awards, four Golden Globes, three Emmy Awards, and a special Tony Award.\n\nMidler has won four Grammy Awards including the 1973 Best New Artist and the prestigious Record of the Year in 1989 for her Platinum-certified #1 Pop hit &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;, the theme from Beaches. Her rendition of the 1990 &quot;From a Distance&quot; also earned a Grammy award (for the song's composer Julie Gold), and became her longest running #1 - six consecutive weeks - on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. It also reached #2 Pop and was another Platinum-selling single for Bette. When the American Film Institute announced &quot;The 100 Years of the Greatest Songs&quot; on June 22, 2004, two of Midler's recordings were selected by the board: &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; (#44) and &quot;The Rose&quot; (#83). However, after years of erratic record sales, Midler was dropped from the Warner Brothers label in 2001, after nearly three decades with Warner Music Group.\n\nBeaches (AKA Forever Friends), is a 1988 Academy Award-nominated movie adapted by Mary Agnes Donoghue from the novel of the same name by Iris Rainer Dart. It was directed by Garry Marshall, and stars Bette Midler, Barbara Hershey, John Heard, James Read, Spalding Gray, Lainie Kazan, Mayim Bialik and Marcie Leeds.\n\nThe film's theme song, Hot 100 #1 &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; went on to win Grammys for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1990.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acd7c91c91f8e5730b6f127ac313377730007045","amp;dn":"Bette+Midler+-+Wind+Beneath+My+Wings++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acd7c91c91f8e5730b6f127ac313377730007045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,215,201,28,145,248,229,115,11,111,18,122,195,19,55,119,48,0,112,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
