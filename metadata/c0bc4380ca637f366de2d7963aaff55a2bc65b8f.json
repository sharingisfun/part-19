Divine Fits, the project of Spoon's Britt Daniel, Wolf Parade, and Handsome Furs' Dan Boeckner, and New Bomb Turks' Sam Brown defies all of these expectations, in large part because their debut album, A Thing Called Divine Fits, sounds far too natural, and not nearly showy enough, to be seen as the work of a supergroup. The trio's seamless blend of Boeckner's new wave-y synth pop and Daniel's precision-tuned rock was hinted at with A Thing Called Divine Fits' lead single &quot;My Love Is Real,&quot; and that song's starkly, darkly catchy vibe contains the rest of the album's sound: throbbing, understated synths, insistent beats that jab listeners like a finger in the chest, and echoing vocals that sound like they were recorded in an alley in the middle of the night. Remarkably, this album manages to be even more spare and streamlined than Daniel's work with Spoon; while it's tempting to say that his aesthetic predominates in any of his collaborations, it may just be Brown who helps make A Thing Called Divine Fits so relentless from start to finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0bc4380ca637f366de2d7963aaff55a2bc65b8f","amp;dn":"Divine+Fits+-+A+Thing+Called+Divine+Fits+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0bc4380ca637f366de2d7963aaff55a2bc65b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,188,67,128,202,99,127,54,109,226,215,150,58,175,245,90,43,198,91,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
