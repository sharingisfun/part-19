But time does not work on everything with equal force. The art of the Fauves has not faded. Born within French painting at the turn of the century, Fauvism immediately demanded attention.\nThe stormy reaction it provoked on its emergence in Paris in 1905 was, in itself, an acknowledgement of the strength of this new phenomenon in the fine arts. Fauvism was a real danger to academically congealed art calculated to appeal to the narrow-minded customer, to all painting which sought after prosperity by carefully absorbing innovation,\nturning it into the fashionable that would shock no-one through unwarranted boldness.\nTwo or three years proved sufficient for the Fauvist painters to acquire Ã¢â‚¬â€ if not a permanent public, then at least their own dealers and admirers. The hostile voices which continued to make themselves heard were not enough to hinder the Fauves from competing freely with other trends.\n\nAbout the Author\nSince 1961, Nathalia BrodskaÃƒÂ¯a is curator of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. The author has published monographs on Rousseau, Renoir, Derain, Vlaminck and Van Dongen. She has also written other titles on the Fauves. She currently devotes her time to researching the French painters of the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nCONTENTS\nA History of Fauvism 7\nHenri Matisse 67\nMaurice de Vlaminck 85\nAndrÃƒÂ© Derain 95\nAlbert Marquet 105\nRaoul Dufy 117\nOthon Friesz 125\nHenri Manguin 137\nKees Van Dongen 145\nGeorges Rouault 153\nJean Puy 159\nLouis Valtat 167\nHenri Le Fauconnier 175\nRenÃƒÂ© Seyssaud 181\nAuguste Chabaud\nGeorges Dupuis\nHenri Lebasque\nPierre Girieud 185\nNotes 192\nIndex 196","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec7ee9369792902d8690341b8c712f4129960a7","amp;dn":"The+Fauves+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec7ee9369792902d8690341b8c712f4129960a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,199,238,147,105,121,41,2,216,105,3,65,184,199,18,244,18,153,96,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
