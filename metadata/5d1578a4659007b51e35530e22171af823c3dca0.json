Richard Shell and Mario Moussa know what it takes to drive new ideas through complex organizations. They have advised thousands of executives from companies such as Google, Microsoft, and General Electric to organizations like the World Bank and even the FBI's hostage rescue training program. In The Art of Woo, they present their systematic, four- step process for winning over even the toughest bosses and most skeptical colleagues. Beginning with two powerful self-assessments to help readers find their &quot;Woo IQ,&quot;they show how relationship-based persuasion works to open hearts and minds.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d1578a4659007b51e35530e22171af823c3dca0","amp;dn":"Art+of+Woo%2C+The+-+G.+Richard+Shell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d1578a4659007b51e35530e22171af823c3dca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,21,120,164,101,144,7,181,30,53,83,14,34,23,26,248,35,195,220,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
