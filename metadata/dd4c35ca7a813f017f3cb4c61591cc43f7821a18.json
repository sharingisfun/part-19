A brief review is presented about a very interesting application of laser beams in the fields of materials science. In addition, safe and precise cavity detection, especially of dangerous or inaccessible voids, is essential to safe production in a working mine. The advantages and disadvantages of laser detection systems are analyzed, and a combination of laser scanning techniques and conventional survey methodology is proposed. Other chapters in this book present an overview on laser cladding, a discussion of the applications of structured laser beams in laser refractography technology, a review of some fundamentals of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and an analysis of laser forming of steel parts by means of diode lasers.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface vii\r\nChapter 1 Computer Modeling of Nanostructuring on\r\nMaterials with Tightly Focused Energy Deposition 1\r\nChapter 2 Quantum Kinetics of Multiphoton Processes:\r\nDurations of Elementary Processes, Thresholds\r\nof Channels Opening and Their Saturations 95\r\nChapter 3 Two-Dimensional Periodic Nanoscale Patterning\r\nof Solid Surfaces by Four-Beam Standing\r\nWave Excimer Laser Lithography 159\r\nChapter 4 ZnO Nanostructures Deposited by Laser Ablation 205\r\nChapter 5 Diode Laser Forming of Steel Parts 245\r\nChapter 6 Lasers and Lamps with Excitation\r\nby Background-Electron Multiplication Wave 283\r\nChapter 7 Phase Transitions as Possible Sources\r\nof High Power Radiation 313\r\nChapter 8 Application of Pulsed Laser Deposition for Putting\r\nMulti-Layer Coatings on the Inner Surfaces of Hollow Objects 331\r\nChapter 9 Underground Cavity 3D Detection Using Laser System 351\r\nChapter 10 Laser Cladding: An Overview 367\r\nChapter 11 Laser Prototyping of Polymer-Based Nanoplasmonic Components 383\r\nChapter 12 Structured Beams in Laser Refractography Applications 399\r\nChapter 13 Optical Breakdown in Gases Induced by\r\nHigh-Power IR CO2 Laser Pulses 415\r\nChapter 14 Machining Steel XC42 by High-Power Continuous\r\nCO2 Laser (Physical Process Description,\r\nEnergetic and Thermal Modeling) 501\r\nIndex 517\r\n \nhttp://s17.postimg.org/lla5wr4kf/Laser_Beams_Theory_Properties_and_Application.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd4c35ca7a813f017f3cb4c61591cc43f7821a18","amp;dn":"Laser+Beams+-+Theory%2C+Properties+and+Applications+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd4c35ca7a813f017f3cb4c61591cc43f7821a18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,76,53,202,122,129,63,1,127,60,180,198,21,145,204,67,247,130,26,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
