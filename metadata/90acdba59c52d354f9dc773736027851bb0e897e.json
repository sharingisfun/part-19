Malice, the band?s latest\n   effort, shows THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD showcasing a more brutal, violent\n   and focused aural attack than many listeners may have expected.\n\n   With new frontman Nate Johnson (ex-Premonitions of War) firmly in tow,\n   THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD have constructed a brutally heavy record, worthy\n   of Johnson?s guttural and deep growling onslaught and already established\n   extreme credentials. Pairing a more death metal sound, thanks to mature\n   riffing and frantic drumming, along with Johnson?s vocal repertoire has given\n   the band new life; where many bands opt for a more ?mature? or melodic sound\n   as time passes them by, THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD has done the complete\n   opposite. Heavier, faster and more extreme are the new dictators here.\n\n   And why not? Considering the band enlisted the skills of Erik Rutan\n   (ex-Morbid Angel, Hate Eternal) to record Malice, THROUGH THE EYES OF THE\n   DEAD?s progression into the territory of unabashed death metal with hints of\n   guitar-driven melody and plenty of double bass, one could say the move was an\n   aptly-timed shift into heavier waters. The follow-up to 2005?s Bloodlust,\n   Malice builds upon the solid - and dedicated - fan base the band established\n   while headlining small venues, hitting the road with the likes of Children of\n   Bodom, God Forbid and Sounds of the Underground 2006, as well as ultimately\n   concluding the record?s cycle with a vastly successful headlining tour in the\n   winter of 2006, now is the time that THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD establishes\n   itself as a band that will be around for awhile; not just another flavor of\n   the week.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
