He traces the transformation of a young, vulnerable boy, Prince Henry, into the aggressive teenager who would become Henry VIII, and of Catherine of Aragon, his future queen. And at the book's heart is the tragic, magnetic figure of Henry VII - controlling, paranoid, avaricious, with a Machiavellian charm and will to power.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11e53ee5431b172d7893a70f7e3a23b16d2dcfac","amp;dn":"The+Winter+King%3A+The+Dawn+of+the+Tudor+Age+-+Thomas+Penn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11e53ee5431b172d7893a70f7e3a23b16d2dcfac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,229,62,229,67,27,23,45,120,147,167,15,126,58,35,177,109,45,207,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
