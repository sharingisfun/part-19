The band was originally formed in Ventura, California, in 1989 by leader Scotty Morris. The band was named Big Bad Voodoo Daddy after Scotty Morris met blues guitar legend Albert Collins at one of the latter's concerts. &quot;He signed my poster 'To Scotty, the big bad voodoo daddy',&quot; Morris explains. &quot;I thought it was the coolest name I ever heard on one of the coolest musical nights I ever had. So when it came time to name this band, I didn't really have a choice. I felt like it was handed down to me.&quot; Save My Soul is the fifth studio album by the swing group.\n\n1.
