If you loved Connor in From Ashes, this is the story for you.\n\nShe's the Girl Next Door.\n\nMaci Price isn't really into relationships. Having four very protective older brothers has always made having a boyfriend very difficult, anyway. But her friend is set on finding her the perfect guy - and thinks the mysterious Connor Green is the perfect pick.\n\nHe's Her Brother's Best Friend.\n\nConnor Green is trying to find himself again. He loved then lost and it's time for him to pick up the pieces. His brooding is making his friends crazy, but, Maci Price, who has grown up into a gorgeous and incredibly sexy woman, is about to break the spell.\n\nThey're Made for Each Other.\n\nWhen Maci starts up old pranks to get Connor out of his slump, an all out war leads to a night that will break all their rules, and a relationship they must keep hidden. Together they're electric. Apart they're safe. And soon they'll find they're exactly what the other needs.\n\nAuthor:\n\nMolly McAdams grew up in California but now lives in the oh-so-amazing state of Texas with her husband and furry four-legged daughter. Her hobbies include hiking, snowboarding, traveling, and long walks on the beach...which roughly translates to being a homebody with her hubby and dishing out movie quotes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48e5487ee93adbf42280070cfa8972c9086f7293","amp;dn":"Needing+Her+%282014%29+Molly+McAdams+%28multi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48e5487ee93adbf42280070cfa8972c9086f7293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,229,72,126,233,58,219,244,34,128,7,12,250,137,114,201,8,111,114,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
