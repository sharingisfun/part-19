The twisted minds that brought you National Lampoon?s Lost Reality, Animal House and Van Wilder are back with more of their hilariously demented look at the continuing phenomenon that is reality television. The vaults have been re-opened as we present another round of TV pilots so outrageous and controversial that TV networks wouldn?t dare air them. In Volume 2, a series of comedians introduce 10 different pilots that thankfully never made it to air. It includes more unearthed footage from returning favorites The Amazing Racist and Money, plus new gems like Midget Wars, Dumpster Dinner and Beer Goggles.\n\n\nVideo: XVID 608x448 29.97fps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 197Kbps\nSize: 697MB (731258880 bytes)\nLenght: 01:17:15\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:987eb69e24d210469cebaf7abd04bfc4d6379f63","amp;dn":"National+Lampoon%5C%27s+LOST+REALITY+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"987eb69e24d210469cebaf7abd04bfc4d6379f63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,126,182,158,36,210,16,70,156,235,175,122,189,4,191,196,214,55,159,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
