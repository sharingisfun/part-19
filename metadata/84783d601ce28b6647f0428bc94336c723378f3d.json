The screenplay was written by Emil Braginsky and Ryazanov, loosely based on Ryazanov's 1971 play 'Once on New Year's Eve' The movie was filmed in 1975 at Mosfilm. Simultaneously a screwball comedy and a love story tinged with sadness, the film is traditionally broadcast in Russia and some other former Soviet republics every New Year's Eve. It is as fondly viewed every year during the Christmas holidays. Many memorable quotes from the film have become catch phrases in the Russian language.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84783d601ce28b6647f0428bc94336c723378f3d","amp;dn":"Irony+of+Fate+or+Enjoy+your+Bath+%5BENGSUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84783d601ce28b6647f0428bc94336c723378f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,120,61,96,28,226,139,102,71,240,66,139,201,67,54,199,35,55,143,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
