Combining stark realism with Germanic expressionism, the movie is a brilliant good-and-evil parable, with &quot;good&quot; represented by a couple of farm kids and a pious old lady, and &quot;evil&quot; literally in the hands of a posturing psychopath. Imprisoned with thief Ben Harper (Peter Graves), phony preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) learns that Ben has hidden a huge sum of money somewhere near his home. Upon his release, the murderously misogynistic Powell insinuates himself into Ben's home, eventually marrying his widow Willa (Shelley Winters). Eventually all that stands between Powell and the money are Ben's son (Billy Chapin) and daughter (Sally Jane Bruce), who take refuge in a home for abandoned children presided over by the indomitable, scripture-quoting Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish). The war of wills between Mitchum and Gish is the heart of the film's final third, a masterful blend of horror and lyricism. Laughton's tight, disciplined direction is superb -- and all the more impressive when one realizes that he intensely disliked all child actors. The music by Walter Schumann and the cinematography of Stanley Cortez are every bit as brilliant as the contributions by Laughton and Agee. Overlooked on its first release, The Night of the Hunter is now regarded as a classic. \n\nD:\\BT Uploads - para enviar\\The Night of the Hunter\\The Night of the Hunter.avi\n   General\n      Complete name : D:\\BT Uploads - para enviar\\The Night of the Hunter\\The Night of the Hunter.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.39 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 132 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 1 735 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.280\n      Stream size : 1.13 GiB (81%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 128 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 128 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 49 ms (1.17 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048424/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048424/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nDual audio: film audio in channel one and commentaries in channel two.\n\nCharles Laughton - The Night of the Hunter (1955)\n\nMy rip of the Criterion DVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:084bd3c0db9c2e28b515c2a5559a101e9cc119dc","amp;dn":"Charles+Laughton+-+The+Night+of+the+Hunter+%281955%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"084bd3c0db9c2e28b515c2a5559a101e9cc119dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,75,211,192,219,156,46,40,181,21,194,165,85,154,16,30,156,193,25,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
