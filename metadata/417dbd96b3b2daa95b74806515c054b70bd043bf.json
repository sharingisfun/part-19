No demo-stuff needed from the NI site to get the ball rolling like some other torrents out there say you need. Both files are here. Install 1.0.0 and then 1.1.0 and you're good. Took forever to find the 1.0.0 file but I did finally. It will work with the deepstatus torrent as well, but you need to run 1.0.0 first. Working on my PC right now.
