Today he is to be executed by lethal injection in Louisiana. Rudy's parting words are &quot;Go big&quot; - he wants her to change the system that allows such injustices to occur.\r\n\r\nWith Rudy's appeal ringing in her ears, Maya returns to London and discovers that she's been pegged to take the role of director of public prosecutions, a prominent position that might allow her to finally bring to justice the death of her friend Michael Antwi, a charismatic anti-racism campaigner.\r\n\r\nMaya's husband Nick Johnson is a man dedicated to his wife and children. When a hidden past threatens to destroy his world, to what lengths will he go to protect his family?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60170dd4049ddd09f137f1045dfc39ccbfea2855","amp;dn":"Undercover.%5B2016%5D.s01e01.BBC.ONE.UK.EN.SUB.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60170dd4049ddd09f137f1045dfc39ccbfea2855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,23,13,212,4,157,221,9,241,55,241,4,93,252,57,204,191,234,40,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
