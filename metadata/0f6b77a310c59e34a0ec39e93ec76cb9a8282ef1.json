And while the sight of a man who resembles a Doobie Brothers roadie riding a gigantic buffalo is spectacular in itself, the producers decide to spice up the action a bit by keeping crates of vicious wild animals just off-screen and occasionally releasing them to attack Jake and the buffalo. Bears, wolves and cougars all show up to take on Jake, who appears to have been informed of these animalsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ presence seconds before they were released.\n\nYou may have seen the clips of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guy on a BuffaloÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ song. Please, let us reassure you that you have NOT experienced the entire Buffalo Rider universe until youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen the whole movie. This is a film that devotes nearly 1/10th of its screen time to tell the tale of a very, very unfortunate raccoon named Bandit. It has its own majestic theme song that you will be singing for days afterwards.  Imagine if all you saw of Birdemic were the coat-hanger scenes.  YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be forgiven for assuming that was all the movie had to offer, but then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d miss out on solrpnls, hanging out with your family and the spruce bark beetles. Please do not miss out on Buffalo Rider. Although the cougar punching is still pretty damn sweet...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f6b77a310c59e34a0ec39e93ec76cb9a8282ef1","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Buffalo+Rider","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f6b77a310c59e34a0ec39e93ec76cb9a8282ef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,107,119,163,16,197,158,52,160,236,57,233,62,199,108,185,168,40,46,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
