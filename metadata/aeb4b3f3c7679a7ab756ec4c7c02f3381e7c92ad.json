He is believed to be identical to a certain Herry de Patenir who joined Antwerp's Guild of St. Luke in 1535 as a painter. He may have been related to the landscape painter Joachim Patinir, although he may not have trained under him because of the age difference.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb4b3f3c7679a7ab756ec4c7c02f3381e7c92ad","amp;dn":"Herri+Met+de+Bles+%281510+-+1550%29+%28Art+Paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb4b3f3c7679a7ab756ec4c7c02f3381e7c92ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,180,179,243,199,103,154,122,183,86,236,76,124,2,243,56,30,124,146,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
