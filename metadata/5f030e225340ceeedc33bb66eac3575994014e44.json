Or install the game in a non-Windows protected path\n(aka outside of &quot;Program Files&quot;) for example &quot;C:My GamesFinal Fantasy VIII&quot;.\n\nThere is a bug when using a control for playing, a screen with the button\nconfiguration appears before the main menu and cannot be skipped using the control\nbuttons, you need to press the Ã¢â‚¬Å“XÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on your keyboard to skip it.\n\nMisc Notes:                                                \n                                                               \nThis is a repack of the Steam release of Final Fantasy VIII (Ver. 1.0.1.0).\n\nIt includes some fixes for a better playing experience:\n\n1.- Better music (closely similar to the one in the original PSX release). For even\n    higher quality music and customization please install the &quot;Roses And Wine 2013&quot; mod:\n\n2.- Better FMVs (the ones from the original PC release).\n3.- Better sounds and music (less compressed) for the FMVs (ripped from the original.\n    PSX release).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f030e225340ceeedc33bb66eac3575994014e44","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+VII1+2013+PC+Release+Repack+HQ+Music%2FFMV+%5BEng%2FSpa%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f030e225340ceeedc33bb66eac3575994014e44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,3,14,34,83,64,206,238,220,51,187,102,234,195,87,89,148,1,78,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
