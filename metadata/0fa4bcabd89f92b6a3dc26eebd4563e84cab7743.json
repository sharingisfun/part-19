One night during the summer, Brigid Polk, a long-time friend and fan of the Velvets, brought a cassette recorder to MaxÃ‚Â´s to preserve a typical performance for herself. This record is a distillation of the cassette Brigid made that night. (In some ways, this record may be looked at as the first legitimate bootleg album.) The sound of the record is surprisingly good, and, of course, is mono. The low price of this album reflects the low recording costs, and is not a reflection on the Velvet UndergroundÃ‚Â´s performance -- far from it. Given the fact that the Velvets have gone through personnel changes in the last couple of years, this album stands as the exciting and valuable record of a special group at a special moment in time and space.\n\n1.
