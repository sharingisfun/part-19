For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAnyway, this is the 2004 reissue of the first album in what has later become known as &quot;The Trilogy&quot;, followed by &quot;So Long Ago The garden&quot; in 1973, and finally &quot;In Another Land&quot; in 1976 (Some say -75, but that was when it was recorded, from what I've heard. I don't know, and besides it is totally beside the point.. :-)\n\nThere were originally 10 tracks on the album, and there are 6 bonus tracks in addition to those on this release.\n&quot;The Outlaw&quot;, &quot;Why Don't You Look Into Jesus&quot;, Righteous Rocker #1&quot;, &quot;I Wish We'd All Been Ready&quot;, &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;, Why Should The Devil Have All The Good Music?&quot; and &quot;Readers Digest&quot;. They're all classics, and they're all on here.\n\nThe Album was recorded at George Martin's A.I.R. Studios in London. George Martin was, for those who do not know, The Beatles' producer.\nBillboard Magazine reviewed the album, and wrote that Larry was &quot;the most important songwriter since Paul Simon&quot;. I guess they weren't bold (or broadminded?) enough to mention that Larry writes lyrics that, in my opinion, are just as brilliant as those of Bob Dylan..\n\n&quot;Well my phone is tapped, and my lips are chapped from talking through the fence.\nYou know every move I make, or is that just coincidence.\nWill you try to make my life a little less like jail,\nIf I promise to make tapes and slides and send them through the mail?&quot;\n\n&quot;You say all men are equal, all men are brothers.\nThen why are the rich more equal than others?\nDon't ask Me for the answers, I've got only one:\nThat a Man leaves his darkness when he follows the Son.&quot; \n\n&quot;What a mess the world is in,\nI wonder who began it?\nDon't ask me,\nI'm Only Visiting This Planet.&quot;\n\nIn Memory of Larry Norman (1947-2008)\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1e687b6c7778776c7b737f77725e79737f7772307d7173&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60e7a287c262e02103ae3320fe972d34a3af41fd","amp;dn":"Larry+Norman+-+Only+Visting+This+Planet+%5B1972%5D%282004+Reissue%29%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60e7a287c262e02103ae3320fe972d34a3af41fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,231,162,135,194,98,224,33,3,174,51,32,254,151,45,52,163,175,65,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
