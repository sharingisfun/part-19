Each of the first three selections is built upon a constant\nrevolving ostinato, and each evolves from one stage to the next like a\nJarrett solo piano improvisation. &quot;Dancing&quot; has a swaying Latin beat in the\npercussion and bass; &quot;Endless&quot; is full of lyrical invention at a slower\ntempo; &quot;Lifeline&quot; is catchy and hypnotic; and the fourth number, &quot;Ecstasy,&quot;\ngrows out of &quot;Lifeline,&quot; closing the album perhaps inevitably with a\ndrawn-out, peaceful piano tremolo. Bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Jack\nDeJohnette are clearly listening hard, going with the flow. The recordings\nwere taken from four separate concerts in Denver, Dallas, Lexington, KY.,\nand Houston. Jarrett may spout off about society's self-centered\nsoullessness in his querulous liner notes, but he and his trio have clearly\nbacked his words by example, pulling off a genuine collective musical\nexperience.\n\nP R O O F S:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/changeless-mw0000654753&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/changeless-mw0000654753&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://iceimg.com/i/ca/35/18f6f85860.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://iceimg.com/i/ca/35/18f6f85860.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://iceimg.com/i/8b/3e/505cab53dc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://iceimg.com/i/8b/3e/505cab53dc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfd012cbf637f68a6e57777e5a8440d68d652251","amp;dn":"Keith+Jarrett+Trio-Changeless-CD-FLAC-1989-DeVOiD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfd012cbf637f68a6e57777e5a8440d68d652251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,208,18,203,246,55,246,138,110,87,119,126,90,132,64,214,141,101,34,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
