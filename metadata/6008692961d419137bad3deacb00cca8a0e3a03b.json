Scotland's Malinky take the opposite tack with their fourth album, emphasizing songs over instrumentals and featuring rather unusual arrangements that sometimes pair male and female vocals together -- an approach that is somewhat unique among trad groups. The singing is excellent: Steve Byrne avoids the thin, weedy vocal style favored by so many of his compatriots, and instead sings in a richer, slightly chestier style that very nicely complements the flute-like voice of Fiona Hunter. Most of the songs on Flower &amp; Iron are traditional, and some are quite familiar: &quot;The Broomfield Hill&quot; is very closely related to &quot;The Bonnie Green Broom,&quot; and those familiar with the Child collection of ballads will likely recognize &quot;Sweet Willie and Fair Annie&quot; as well. But the arrangements are all new and quietly innovative, and when the band takes off on a sprightly set of reels or slip jigs, the effect is electrifying. The album's low point is a rather ham-fisted antiwar song called &quot;When Margaret Was Eleven,&quot; but even that one's not bad.\n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/23/malinky/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/23/malinky/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6008692961d419137bad3deacb00cca8a0e3a03b","amp;dn":"Malinky...Flower+%26+Iron%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6008692961d419137bad3deacb00cca8a0e3a03b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,8,105,41,97,212,25,19,123,173,61,234,203,0,204,168,160,227,160,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
