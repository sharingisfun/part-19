Signings were also changed, and now require a number of faxes between the clubs and the player, which can delay a transfer by two weeks. Players now also have positions, defined by skills. A player with high tackling is a defender, both high tackling and passing is a defensive midfielder, and so on. By intensive training a player can be adapted successfully to a new position, and there's also a favorite side, which makes the difference between an attacking midfielder and a winger. On the downside, players no longer have a personality trait. With the exception of the player's potential (which defines the speed a player, particularly young, increases his abilities), everything can be edited using the in-game editor.\n\nThe rest of the game remained mostly unchanged, from the interface, composed by static pictures of several offices where options are reached by clicking on hotspots (like a TV for the teletext, where in-depth statistics can be consulted) to the financial options, where the player is given the lot of land close to the stadium to build stores for both marketing and merchandising.\n\n\nIt's a great game , was great in it's time and it's still fun now .\nYou just unrar the game and enter USM98.\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS PLAYING THIS GAME ON WINDOWS XP THEN GO HERE FOR HELP &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.neoseeker.com/forums/3877/t364721-repair-problems-with-usm98-99-in-winxp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.neoseeker.com/forums/3877/t364721-repair-problems-with-usm98-99-in-winxp/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:319a71def5745e1965766cf72b9fd5d522b183e9","amp;dn":"Ultimate.Soccer.Manager.98.RIP%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"319a71def5745e1965766cf72b9fd5d522b183e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,154,113,222,245,116,94,25,101,118,108,247,43,159,213,213,34,177,131,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
