It brings to light new source materials documenting MengeleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diabolical concentration camp experiments and documents the activities of Himmler, Eichmann, and other Nazi leaders. It also demonstrates comprehensive evidence of Jewish resistance and the heroic efforts of Gentiles to aid and shelter Jews and others targeted for extermination, even at the risk of their own lives.\n\nCombining survivor testimonies, deft historical analysis, and painstaking research, The Holocaust is without doubt a masterwork of World War II history. \n\n\nAbout the author:\nSir Martin Gilbert is a leading British historian and the author of more than eighty books. Specializing in 20th century history, he is also the official biographer of Winston Churchill and has written an eight-volume biography of the war leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life.\n\nBorn in London in 1936, Martin Gilbert was evacuated to Canada with his family at the beginning of World War II as part of the British governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts to protect children from the brutal bombings of the Luftwaffe. He was made a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1962. He is the author of several definitive historical works examining the Holocaust, the First and Second World Wars, and the history of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1990, Gilbert was designated a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and was awarded a Knighthood in 1995. Oxford University awarded him a Doctorate in 1999. Today, he is a sought-after speaker on Churchill, Jewish history, and the history of the 20th century, and he travels frequently to lecture at colleges, universities, and organizations around the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8058a64985207819b8f0b06fc0340b490e16e9e","amp;dn":"The+Holocaust+-+Martin+Gilbert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8058a64985207819b8f0b06fc0340b490e16e9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,5,138,100,152,82,7,129,155,143,11,6,252,3,64,180,144,225,110,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
