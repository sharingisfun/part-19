The VSC-2 plugin captures all the fine nuances of this 6,000$ flagship VCA compressor.\n\nThe Mercedes of VCA compressors from German manufacturer Vertigo Sound! The VSC-2 Quad Discrete Compressor is so named because it uses 4 VCAs built by hand using only discrete components. Its design is a nod toward the best VCA based compressors of the 70s and 80s.\n\nFeatures\nPrecision\nIts precision makes the VSC-2 a first choice for mastering applications and the stereo mix bus.\n\nTracking &amp; Mixing\nAlthough the VSC-2 was developed as a Stereo Bus Compressor each channel provides a complete set of controls which also makes the VSC-2 a dual mono Ã¢â‚¬Å“Must HaveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in recording and mix situations.\n\nPlugin\nThe VSC-2 plugin offers the same flexibility and precision in the stereo version, and to emulate the dual mono approach of the hardware we have developed a true mono version of the plugin as well.\n\nA Word From Vertigo\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We are amazed how accurate the plugin simulates the real deal. We have compared it to the hardware several times now in a professional studio and cannot hear any difference at all. Is that good or bad?!?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, says Andreas Eschenwecker, CEO of Vertigo Sound. \n\n\nInstallation                                             \n1) Run Setup.exe and install to your VST directory and/or RTAS directory  \n                             \n2) Have Fun!    \n                                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/plugins/detail/vertigo_vsc-2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/plugins/detail/vertigo_vsc-2.html&lt;/a&gt;           ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2770ef56a98ca37efe5fcfbcf9ce58547e704869","amp;dn":"Vertigo.Sound.VSC-2.v1.1.2.x86.x64-R2R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2770ef56a98ca37efe5fcfbcf9ce58547e704869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,112,239,86,169,140,163,126,254,95,207,188,249,206,88,84,126,112,72,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
