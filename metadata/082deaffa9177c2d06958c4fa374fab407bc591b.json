Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:082deaffa9177c2d06958c4fa374fab407bc591b","amp;dn":"David+Hare+Plays+3+-+Skylight%3B+Amy%27s+View%3B+The+Judas+Kiss%3B+My+Zi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"082deaffa9177c2d06958c4fa374fab407bc591b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,45,234,255,169,23,124,45,6,149,140,79,163,116,250,180,7,188,89,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
