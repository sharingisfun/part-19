It raises serious questions as to the primary beneficiary of US policy, and its destructive results for the United States. The extraordinary extent of US political, economic, military and diplomatic support for the state of Israel is explored, along with the means whereby such support is generated and consolidated. Contending that Zionist power in America ensured unconditional US backing for Israeli colonization of Palestine and its massive uprooting of Palestinians, it views the interests of Israel rather than those of Big Oil as the primary cause of the disastrous US wars against Iraq and threats of war against Iran and Syria. It demonstrates and condemns US imitation of Israeli practice as it relates to conduct of the war on terrorism and torture. It sheds light on the AIPAC spying scandal and other Israeli espionage against America; the fraudulent and complicit role of AmericaÃƒÂ¢??s academic &quot;terrorist experts&quot; in furthering criminal government policies, and the orchestration of the Danish cartoons to foment antipathy between Muslims and the West. It questions the inability in America to sustain or even formulate a discourse related to the subject of Israeli influence on the United States. It calls for a review of American Mid East policy with a view to reclaiming US independence of action based upon enlightened self-interest and progressive principles. Petras seems to cover it all in this scathing and incredibly well informed analysis of Zionist control over United States decision making regarding the Middle East. He proffers a myriad of statistics augmenting his point that the Jewish Lobby is ultimately in the driver&amp;#039;s seat when the Pentagon, State Department and Executive Branch deliberate on Middle Eastern policy, and carry out their policy objectives in that region of the world. The Power of Israel in the United States is an eye-opening book for every advocate of democracy and every opponent of imperialism. 180 pages. A must read for everyone.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION/11\nPART I: ZIONIST POWER IN AMERICA\nChapter 1.\nWHO FABRICATED THE IRAQ WAR THREAT? /19\nThe Jewish Lobby, Not Big Oil /21\nChapter 2.\nTHE US-IRAQ-ISRAEL-ZIONIST CONNECTION 127\nWho Benefited from the Iraq War? / 27\nUnanswered Questions: September 11 and the Israelis / 35\nTheoretical Issues/36\nWho Finances the State of Israel? / 39\nSupport for Israel from the US Government/41\nIsrael Bonds / 43 Accomplices to Genocide / 45\nThe Zionist Power Configuration in the United States / 46 The ZPC in\nAction: The Iraq War / 48 Israel and the Right of Free Speech / 54\nChapter 3.\nTHE LIBBY AFFAIRE AND THE INTERNAL WAR / 61\nThe War Within / 63\nChapter 4.\nEXPOSING THE EXPOSE: SEYMOUR HERSH\nAND THE MISSING ZIONIST-ISRAELI CONNECTION/ 65\nThe Zionists and Torture in Iraq / 67\nA Close Look at Hersh&amp;#039;s Method / 67\nConclusion/71\nChapter 5.\nTHE SPY TRIAL: A POLITICAL BOMBSHELL/73\nAIPAC On Trial/76\nPART II: ISRAEL AND MIDDLE EAST WARFARE\nChapter 6.\nTHE HOUSE OF HORRORS:\nTORTURE, ASSASSINATIONS AND GENOCIDE / 82\nEmpire Building/82\nImperial Consolidation / 83\nTargeted Assassinations / 84\nDestruction of Civilian and Military Infrastructure / 86\nConclusion/90\nChapter 7.\nISRAEL&amp;#039;S FINAL SOLUTION: THE ASSAULT ON GAZA/ 93\nIntroduction/94\nFrom the Present to the Past / 95 The Final Destruction of Six Myths\nabout the Jewish State and the Lobby / 96\n1.
