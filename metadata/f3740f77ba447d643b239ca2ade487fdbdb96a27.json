This study seeks an epistemological criterion of truth that is attentive to the sociopolitical conditions that determine meaning.\n\n=====================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nALIREZA SHOMALI is Assistant Professor of Political Science at Wheaton College, Massachusetts.
