Nuclear reactors now account for a significant portion of the electrical power generated worldwide, and new power reactors with improved fuel cycles are being developed. At the same time, the past few decades have seen an ever-increasing number of industrial, medical, military, and research applications for nuclear reactors. The second edition of this successful comprehensive textbook and reference on basic and advanced nuclear reactor physics has been completely updated, revised and enlarged to include the latest developments. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:057c91b5bb679a2436a1609a704cd1a4c6e7995e","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Reactor+Physics+%7Bpurestevil%7Drelease","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"057c91b5bb679a2436a1609a704cd1a4c6e7995e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,124,145,181,187,103,154,36,54,161,96,154,112,76,209,164,198,231,153,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
