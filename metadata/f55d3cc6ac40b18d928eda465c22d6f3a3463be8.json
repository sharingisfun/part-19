The duo endured several failed experiments in both band lineups and musical styles before discovering that Nina Diaz, Phanie's younger sister, possessed talent as a singer, guitarist, and songwriter. Though Nina was only 12 when she performed her first song for them, both Alva and Diaz recognized her potential. After recruiting the younger Diaz, Girl in a Coma spent five years writing, performing, and touring before coming to the attention of label reps and tour managers in the summer of 2004. One of the managers sent a homemade demo tape to Morrissey music director Boz Boorer; after hearing it, Boorer invited the trio to London to record its first demo. Soon after returning, Girl in a Coma found themselves featured in a television documentary about emerging Latino bands. As part of the show, the group went to New York City for a show at the Knitting Factory and a surprise meeting with Joan Jett. While on camera, Jett and her producing partner Kenny Laguna praised the trio's set -- and invited the band to join the Blackheart Records label. Girl in a Coma accepted and released their debut album, Both Before I'm Gone, in May 2007. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Si Una Vez\n02.While My Guitar Gently Weeps\n03.Transmission\n04.As The World Falls Down\n05.Come On, Let's Go\n06.Walkin' After Midnight\n07.Femme Fatale\n08.For What It's Worth\n09.Yo Oigo\n10.BB (Acoustic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f55d3cc6ac40b18d928eda465c22d6f3a3463be8","amp;dn":"Girl+In+A+Coma+-+Adventures+In+Coverland+%282010%29+320+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f55d3cc6ac40b18d928eda465c22d6f3a3463be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,93,60,198,172,64,177,141,146,142,218,70,92,34,214,243,163,70,59,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
