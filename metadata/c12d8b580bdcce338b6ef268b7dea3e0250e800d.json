Originally released in 1982, this rocking set will no doubt appeal to all BOC fans, as well as lovers of commercial guitar music. Comprised of 9 songs, one of which is instrumental, this set showcases Buck's songwriting skills, not to mention his melodic vocals. Oh yeah, the man can play a mean guitar as well.\n\n\nBorn to Rock\t \t3:24\nThat Summer Night\t3:44\nCold Wind\t \t4:38\nYour Loving Heart\t7:12\nFive Thirty-Five\t5:09\nWind Weather and Storm\t2:35\nAll Tied Up\t \t4:16\nAnwar's Theme\t \t4:11\nCome Softly to Me       3:32\n\nmp3 320/kbs\n\nEnjoy, and don't be shy about leaving comments!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c12d8b580bdcce338b6ef268b7dea3e0250e800d","amp;dn":"Flat+Out+1982+%5BB.O.C.%5C%27s+Buck+Dharma%5C%27s+Solo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c12d8b580bdcce338b6ef268b7dea3e0250e800d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,45,139,88,11,220,206,51,139,110,242,104,183,222,163,224,37,14,128,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
