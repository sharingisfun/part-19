The series follows the misadventures of roommates Max (Kat Dennings) and Caroline (Beth Behrs), both financially poor, and their efforts to start a cupcake business in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, New York. \n\n\nPlot:\n----------\nSet in the Williamsburg neighborhood of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the series chronicles the lives of two waitresses in their mid twentiesÃ¢â‚¬â€Max (Kat Dennings), who comes from a poor working-class family, and Caroline (Beth Behrs), who was born rich but is now disgraced and penniless due to her father, Martin Channing, getting caught operating a Bernard Madoff-esque Ponzi schemeÃ¢â‚¬â€working together at a Brooklyn restaurant. The two become friends and build toward their dream of one day opening a cupcake shop. Among those working with them at the restaurant are their boss, Han Lee (Matthew Moy); Oleg (Jonathan Kite), an upbeat but perverted Ukrainian cook; and Earl (Garrett Morris), a 75-year-old African-American cashier. Also featured starting late in the first season is their neighbor and part-time boss Sophie (Jennifer Coolidge), a Polish immigrant who runs the housecleaning company Sophie's Choice. During most of the first season Max is also a part-time nanny for the twin babies of Peach Landis (Brooke Lyons), who during the season adopts Caroline's horse Chestnut. At the end of each episode a tally shows how much they have made toward their goal of $250,000 needed to open their business. Early in the second season, Sophie lends the girls $20,000, which is enough for them to start their business. However, the business fails, and in the 18th episode they are forced to give up the lease of their cupcake shop with just enough money to pay off Sophie's loan, resetting the end of episode tally to $5.00.\n\n\nCast: Kat Dennings\n      Beth Behrs\n      Garrett Morris\n      Jonathan Kite\n      Matthew Moy\n      Jennifer Coolidge\n\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Mkv or Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChannels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\nActual Screenshots:\n---------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/8915/vlcsnap2013050304h00m35.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/8915/vlcsnap2013050304h00m35.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/2294/vlcsnap2013050304h01m09.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/2294/vlcsnap2013050304h01m09.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/848/vlcsnap2013050304h13m44.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/848/vlcsnap2013050304h13m44.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/6721/vlcsnap2013050304h17m16.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/6721/vlcsnap2013050304h17m16.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/3403/vlcsnap2013050304h19m26.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/3403/vlcsnap2013050304h19m26.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/7275/vlcsnap2013050304h21m42.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/7275/vlcsnap2013050304h21m42.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/3770/vlcsnap2013050304h30m28.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/3770/vlcsnap2013050304h30m28.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIMDb:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1845307/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1845307/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbs.com/shows/2_broke_girls/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbs.com/shows/2_broke_girls/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWiki: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Broke_Girls&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Broke_Girls&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1157b0f33ad6dbca60649729f054aee5cfc4e81","amp;dn":"2+Broke+Girls+Season+2+Complete+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1157b0f33ad6dbca60649729f054aee5cfc4e81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,21,123,15,51,173,109,188,166,6,73,114,159,5,74,238,92,252,78,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
