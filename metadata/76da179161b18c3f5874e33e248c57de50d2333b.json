Documenting the pretexts and lies used to justify violent intervention and maldevelopment abroad, Parenti shows how the conversion to a global economy is a victory of finance capital over democracy.\nAs much of the world suffers unspeakable misery and the Third Worldization of the United States accelerates, civil society is impoverished by policies that benefit rich and powerful transnational corporations and the national security state. Hard-won gains made by ordinary people are swept away.\nThe history of imperialism is also, however, a history of resistance, struggle, and achievement: Against Empire offers compelling alternatives for progressive change.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76da179161b18c3f5874e33e248c57de50d2333b","amp;dn":"Michael+Parenti+-+Against+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76da179161b18c3f5874e33e248c57de50d2333b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,218,23,145,97,177,140,63,88,116,227,62,36,140,87,222,80,210,51,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
