Rithy, himself a survivor of the Khmer Rouge, brought together two former prisoners of the regime with their former captors at Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, the former Security Prison 21 (S-21) under the Khmer Rouge.\n\nVann Nath and Chum Mey, two survivors of the Khmer Rouge's Tuol Sleng Prison, are reunited and revisit the former prison, now a museum in Phnom Penh. They meet their former captors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guards, interrogators, a doctor and a photographer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ many of whom were barely teenagers during the Khmer Rouge era from 1975 to 1979. Their appearances are in stark contrast to the two former prisoners, who are both elderly men. Vann Nath, who was made to paint portraits of prisoners, has a full head of white hair.\n\nThe guards and interrogators give a tour of the museum, re-enacting their treatment of the prisoners and daily regimens. They look over the prison's detailed records, including photographs, to refresh their memories.\n\nAt one point, Vann Nath directly confronts his former captors about their actions, but they counter that they themselves were also victims, being little more than children at the time, and hold themselves blameless.\n\nS-21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine premiered at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Prix FranÃƒÂ§ois Chalais. It was also screened at several other film festivals, including the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival (its North American premiere), the New York Film Festival and the Vancouver International Film Festival. It won for best documentary at the Chicago International Film Festival, the European Film Awards and the Valladolid International Film Festival; humanitarian award at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, the FIPRESCI Prize at the Dok Leipzig, a special jury prize at the Copenhagen International Film Festival, and runner-up at the Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival.\n\nIn Cambodia, the film was a catalyst for confession about the Cambodian Civil War. Former Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan saw the film and was moved to admit the existence of the prison after years of publicly denying it.\n\nCast\n\nKhieu 'Poev' Ches (Guard)\nYeay Cheu (Him Houy's mother)\nNhiem Ein (Photographer)\nHouy Him (Security deputy)\nTa Him (Him Houy's Father)\nNhieb Ho (Guard)\nPrakk Kahn (the Torturer)\nPeng Kry (Driver)\nSom Meth (Guard)\nChum Mey (Survivor)\nVann Nath (Survivor)\nTop Pheap (Interrogator &amp; Typist)\nTcheam Seur (Guard)\nMak Thim (S21 Doctor)\nSours Thi (Head of Registers)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:773f3bea26a3e118be875df69029f04d688d8e65","amp;dn":"S21+The+Khmer+Rouge+Killing+Machine+%5B2003%5D+.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"773f3bea26a3e118be875df69029f04d688d8e65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,63,59,234,38,163,225,24,190,135,93,246,144,41,240,77,104,141,142,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
