The adequacy of present models is considered by comparison of simulation and experimental studies, and gaps in understanding or experimental verification of model predictions are identified.\nSeparating reactors, including chromatographic reactors and pressure swing reactors, are an expeditious means of process intensification, reducing both capital and operating costs, particularly where reactions are equilibrium limited. For this reason, cyclically operating separating reactors are attracting considerable interest across the range of chemical manufacturing industries, so this book is a timely and valuable summary of the literature available to the engineer. Following an introduction to multifunctional reactors and to periodic reactor operation, Cyclic Separating Reactors covers both chromatographic and pressure swing adsorption reactors, and is written for chemical engineers in both industry and academe.\n\n\nFirst book to critically examine the literature surrounding Cyclically Operating Separating Reactors providing a straightforward entry to, and detailed appraisal of, the literature, so the reader does not have to engage in an expensive and time consuming literature review\nEvaluates current models and understanding to give the engineer clear information on what performance can be expected of these reactors and where current information needs to be augmented when designing systems for commercial operation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0af30c02fa7412b87350afeb26b5ddcd4e01a204","amp;dn":"Cyclic+Separating+Reactors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0af30c02fa7412b87350afeb26b5ddcd4e01a204","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,243,12,2,250,116,18,184,115,80,175,235,38,181,221,205,78,1,162,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
