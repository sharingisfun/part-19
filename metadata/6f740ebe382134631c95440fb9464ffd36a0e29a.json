It basically means &quot;everything that exists&quot;.  Many have never before been published.  Certainly a must for the Wolverton fan... and aren't we all?\n\nI'm sharing two versions in separate torrents: one at 300 dpi and Photoshop jpeg level 7 which is about 380 megs, and one at 150 dpi level 6 which is about 80 megs.  An average scan in the big set runs about 2500 pixels wide; in the small set, about 1250.\n\nThere's also a sampling of Bedtime Banter, Bedtime Bunk, and Culture Quickie, and an introduction by Basil's son Monte.\n\nHave Fun!\n\nNeon Vincent\n2012-04-10\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f740ebe382134631c95440fb9464ffd36a0e29a","amp;dn":"The+Culture+Corner+by+Basil+Wolverton+Fantagraphics+HC+300+dpi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f740ebe382134631c95440fb9464ffd36a0e29a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,116,14,190,56,33,52,99,28,149,68,15,185,70,79,253,54,160,226,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
