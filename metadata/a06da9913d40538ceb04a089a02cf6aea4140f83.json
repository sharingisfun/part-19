It's doubtful Ridgway ever broke the legs of a no-goodnik named Bing, but gosh darn if you're not thoroughly convinced of it by the end of &quot;Bing Can't Walk,&quot; one of a handful of creaky, ramshackle gems gathered together on the odds-and-sods Holiday in Dirt. He may scribble outside the lines musically, but Ridgway's harp-goosed, art-rock vignettes are enormously detailed--witness the bloopy, futuristic &quot;After the Storm,&quot; the eerily straight-faced midtempo rocker &quot;Whatever Happened to You?&quot; or the unlisted cover of Charlie Rich's &quot;Behind Closed Doors,&quot; cheekily delivered in a character that might have been crafted by Bill Murray circa Caddyshack. Admittedly an acquired taste, Ridgway repays diligence with cartwheeling, consistently unexpected, possibly true parables sucked straight out of the twilight zone that is contemporary America. If Jackson Pollack paintings had sound, they'd probably sound a lot like this. --Kim Hughes\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nPietra Wexstun: keyboards, autoharp, melodica and bg vocals \nDavid Sutton: acoustic and electric bass \nTed &quot;sticks&quot; Anderson: drums \nElmo Smith: bass \nDon Bell: saxophone\nZander Schloss: guitaron, slide and banjo on &quot;Floundering&quot;, &quot;Amnesia&quot; \nMitchell Froom: Organ on &quot;Bing Can't Walk&quot; \nStan Ridgway: guitar, harmonica, keyboards and vocals\n\n\n\n\n\nCD Track Listing\n\n1.Beloved Movie Star (4:49)\n2.Operator Help Me (4:19)\n3.Time Inside (3:56)\n4.End of the Line (5:51)\n5.Garage Band '69 (3:21)\n6.Bing Can't Walk (5:07)\n7.Brand New Special and Unique (2:51)\n8.After the Storm (2:53)\n9.Floundering (3:11)\n10.Amnesia (2:53)\n11.Whatever Happened to You (3:33)\n12.Act of Faith (4:17)\n13.Beloved Movie Star Redux (10:54)\n14.Behind Closed Doors (3:30)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a06da9913d40538ceb04a089a02cf6aea4140f83","amp;dn":"Stan+Ridgway+-+Holiday+In+Dirt++%5B2002%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a06da9913d40538ceb04a089a02cf6aea4140f83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,109,169,145,61,64,83,140,235,4,160,137,160,44,246,174,164,20,15,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
