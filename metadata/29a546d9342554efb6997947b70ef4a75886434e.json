It was released June 29, 2004.\n\nThe album featured the single &quot;Vaccination Scar&quot;. This album is considered one of their best works and became one of the top selling albums of the year in Canada. It also helped to re-establish the band's older musical style. The album was recorded at Studio X in Seattle.\n\nOne of the major themes of this album is the response to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with overtly political anti-war themes throughout the album. In the poignant &quot;Are We Family&quot;, Gordon Downie questions the logic of &quot;taking care of each other one bullet to another&quot;, while &quot;Vaccination Scar&quot; likens the collapse of the rationale of the war to the collapse of Galloping Gertie, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge.\n\n&quot;Gus: The Polar Bear From Central Park&quot; is a metaphor comparing George W. Bush to the famously depressed polar bear in the Central Park Zoo who is &quot;too either them or me&quot;, and speculates that the cause of the problem is that &quot;no one is afraid enough&quot;. &quot;Heaven Is a Better Place Today&quot; doubles as a tribute to Dan Snyder, a player for the Atlanta Thrashers hockey team who died in an automobile accident nine months before the album's release and, as Downie would reveal, for young men being sent to war.\n\nHowever, aside from this last comment regarding &quot;Heaven...&quot; (which is not cited), much of this analysis is purely speculative.\n\nThe Hip performed the song &quot;It Can't be Nashville Every Night&quot; on a season 2 episode of Canadian situation comedy TV program Corner Gas.\n\nAll songs were written by The Tragically Hip.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Heaven is a Better Place Today&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n   2. &quot;Summer's Killing Us&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n   3. &quot;Gus: The Polar Bear from Central Park&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n   4. &quot;Vaccination Scar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57\n   5. &quot;It Can't Be Nashville Every Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n   6. &quot;If New Orleans is Beat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n   7. &quot;You're Everywhere&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n   8. &quot;As Makeshift as We Are&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n   9. &quot;Mean Streak&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n  10. &quot;The Heart of the Melt&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35\n  11. &quot;One Night in Copenhagen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20\n  12. &quot;Are We Family&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n  13. &quot;Goodnight Josephine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n\nSingles\n\n    * &quot;Vaccination Scar&quot;\n    * &quot;It Can't Be Nashville Every Night&quot;\n    * &quot;Gus: The Polar Bear from Central Park&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29a546d9342554efb6997947b70ef4a75886434e","amp;dn":"The+Tragically+Hip+-+In+Between+Evolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29a546d9342554efb6997947b70ef4a75886434e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,165,70,217,52,37,84,239,182,153,121,71,183,14,244,167,88,134,67,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
