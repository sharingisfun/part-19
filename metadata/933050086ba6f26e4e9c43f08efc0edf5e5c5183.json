As she so convincingly argues, the contemporary U.S. practice of super-incarceration is closer to new age slavery than to any recognizable system of 'criminal justice.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Mike Davis, author of Dead Cities and City of Quartz\n\n&quot;In this brilliant, thoroughly researched book, Angela Davis swings a wrecking ball into the racist and sexist underpinnings of the American prison system. Her arguments are well rought and restrained, leveling an unflinching critique of how and why more than 2 million Americans are presently behind bars, and the corporations who profit from their suffering&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Cynthia McKinney, former Congresswoman from Georgia\n\nWith her characteristic brilliance, grace and radical audacity, Angela Y. Davis has put the case for the latest abolition movement in American life: the abolition of the prison. As she quite correctly notes, American life is replete with abolition movements, and when they were engaged in these struggles, their chances of success seemed almost unthinkable. For generations of Americans, the abolition of slavery was sheerest illusion. Similarly, the entrenched system of racial segregation seemed to last forever, and generations lived in the midst of the practice, with few predicting its passage from custom. The brutal, exploitative (dare one say lucrative?) convict-lease system that succeeded formal slavery reaped millions to southern jurisdictions (and untold miseries for tens of thousands of men, and women). Few predicted its passing from the American penal landscape. Davis expertly argues how social movements transformed these social, political and cultural institutions, and made such practices untenable.\n\nIn Are Prisons Obsolete?, Professor Davis seeks to illustrate that the time for the prison is approaching an end. She argues forthrightly for &quot;decarceration,&quot; and argues for the transformation of the society as a whole.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nAngela Yvonne Davis is a professor of history of consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Over the last thirty years, she has been active in numerous organizations challenging prison-related repression. Her advocacy on behalf of political prisoners led to three capital charges, sixteen months in jail awaiting trial, and a highly publicized campaign then acquittal in 1972. In 1973, the National Committee to Free Angela Davis and All Political Prisoners, along with the Attica Brothers, the American Indian Movement and other organizations founded The National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, of which she remained Co-Chairperson for many years. In 1998, she was one of the twenty-five organizers of the historic Berkeley conference &quot;Critical Resistance: Beyond the Prison Industrial Complex&quot; and since that time has served as convener of a research group bearing the same name under the auspices of the University of California Humanities Research Institute. Angela is author of many books, including Blues Legacies and Black Feminism: Gertrude Ã¢â‚¬Å“MaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rainey, Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, and Prisons and Democracy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933050086ba6f26e4e9c43f08efc0edf5e5c5183","amp;dn":"Are+Prisons+Obsolete%3F+by+Angela+Davis+%282003%29+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933050086ba6f26e4e9c43f08efc0edf5e5c5183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,48,80,8,107,166,242,110,78,156,67,240,142,252,14,223,94,92,81,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
