On December 19, 2009 at &quot;Final Battle 2009&quot; Kevin Steen faced that moment. \nWith several choice words and the brutal crack of a steel chair, Kevin made his decision and a slow descent into madness that would \ngrow to effect all of Ring of Honor.\n\nFrom the closing night of Steen &amp; Generico's ROH World Tag Title reign through the war at &quot;Final Battle 2010&quot; that brought this madman's\ntime in ROH to a temporary end, this 2-DVD set is a chronicle of the matches &amp; the moments that saw Steen spiral out of control.\nFrom his tag team battles against The American Wolves &amp; The Young Bucks with El Generico to his Steve Corino-influenced violent turn, \nthis compilation includes Steen's bouts against his former partner, bloody battles against Colt Cabana, his ROH World Championship battle\nagainst Tyler Black (WWE's Seth Roland), and more!  From the violence of his matches to the often psychotic words spewing from his mouth, this is Kevin Steen's\ndescent into madness.\n\n \n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
