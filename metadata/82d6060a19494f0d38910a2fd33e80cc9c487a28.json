And you know that the quality of your reverb can be the difference between the rich sounding mix youÃƒÂ­re after and one that comes off as flat and artificial.\n\nFace it: When it comes to pristine, authentic reverb, itÃƒÂ­s the algorithm that counts. RP-Verb is the fruit of Rob PapenÃƒÂ­s decades-long study of reverb and endless hours of exploring, testing, and tweaking by Rob and Jon Ayres. The result is exactly what you would expect: a stunning, musical reverb that brings unmatched dimension and fullness to your mixes. But if youÃƒÂ­re thinking that this sound quality must come at the cost of usability, fear notÃƒÂ³RP-Verb has a straightforward, intuitive interface that puts all the most essential parameters right at your fingertips. And like all Rob Papen plug-ins, it inspires right out of the box with spot-on presets that range from intimate venues to abstract, surreal spaces.\n\nRP-Verb is the reverb youÃƒÂ­ve waited years to have in your setup. Try it out for yourself and see why pros describe it with one word: ÃƒÂ¬amazingÃƒÂ®.\n\nImportant Note: thx R2R for the permission of this release and respect to this very hard working team.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nRP-Delay is a unique delay which is heavily focused on some very special features, including brand new fx routing!\n\nFor instance, the sound reverser can reverse the input, while simultaneously reversing one of the delay lines. The reverse sound can also be triggered with your keyboard, generating totally new sounds, and sending them into the reverser with its own filter and distortion!\n\nYou can have 6 delay lines with 8 active multi-mode  filters all operating at once in each of several delay models. Of course, we included basic delay models like a simple mono delay and a stereo delay, but also a tape-sound delay which allows you to change tape length without any clicks. The delays, filters, and reverser can all be modulated by the built-in modulators. There are 4 modulation sequencers, 4 LFO's, and 4 envelopes, complete with several trigger options!\n\nThere are many other new features and options for you to discover which aren't mentioned here, so go ahead, take the plunge, and dig into the brand new experience of RP-Delay.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.robpapen.com/rp-delay.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.robpapen.com/rp-delay.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nImportant Note: thx R2R for the permission of this release and respect to this very hard working team.\n\nbe fair, buy after try\ndon`t make money with warzed apps                                      \nsupport developer you like, we do this too\n\nGreetz\nall our friends and hard working grous\n--= TEAM Xdb 2012 =--\n\nfuture-dada  MMXIV.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82d6060a19494f0d38910a2fd33e80cc9c487a28","amp;dn":"Rob+Papen+-+Verb+v1.5.1b+%2B+Delay+v1.0.1b+-+OS+X+-+Xdb+%5Bpacket-da","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82d6060a19494f0d38910a2fd33e80cc9c487a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,214,6,10,25,73,79,13,56,145,10,47,211,62,128,204,156,72,122,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
