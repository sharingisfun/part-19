Characters race through various race circuits themed on different Sega franchises and collect power-ups to boost their speed or hamper their opponents. Additional boost can be earned by successfully executing drifts (with longer drifts earning more boost), or performing tricks while in midair. Like Sumo's previous Sega game, Sega Superstars Tennis, each character has a special ability (called an &quot;All-Star Move&quot;) unique to them that they may use to their advantage (such as Sonic transforming into Super Sonic and AiAi riding in marbles), which they can obtain if they are running behind in the race. How long each All-Star move lasts depends on the character's current position.\n\nVehicles are separated into four different categories: racing, off-road, bike and hovercraft. As the terrain on the tracks will vary, vehicles can be either assisted or hindered by the surfaces they drive upon. For example, racing-type vehicles perform best on hard surfaces such as wood or concrete, but are hampered by soft terrain such as mud, sand or snow. The opposite is true for off-road type vehicles. Hovercrafts are not affected by any terrain and are able to perform multiple boosts after a jump, but they are unable to drift and have low acceleration. All of the vehicles also have their own specific engine sounds.\n\nBy playing through the game, players can earn Sega Miles that can be spent in the in-game shop to unlock additional content such as characters, tracks, art and songs. The game features a total of 24 tracks based on locations from Sonic Heroes, Super Monkey Ball, Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg, Jet Set Radio Future, Samba de Amigo, and The House of the Dead.\n\nThe game will have customizable multiplayer options for up to four players on split-screen and eight players online (four players on DS version, no online support for PC version), including Free Race, Arena, Knockout and Capture the Chao modes. There will also be Grand Prix, Time Trials and Mission modes for single player.\n\nThe soundtrack for the game will consist of various old and new tracks from the various Sonic and Sega franchises, though it will also feature original songs by various artists including Richard Jacques. Each course will start with one track, with more being unlocked as players earn Sega Miles. \n\nPlayable Characters\n \nThe Playable Characters of Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing excluding the console exclusive charactersAt the start of the game, players can play as Sonic, Tails, Dr Eggman, Shadow, Amy, AiAi, Amigo and Billy Hatcher, as well as any console exclusive characters.
