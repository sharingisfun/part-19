Not long after Pearl Harbor, Donald, who was then forty years old, took a leave from Random House and joined the United States Army Air Forces. He served for two and a half years, finally becoming an intelligence major in a B-24 group in England.\n\nDonald and Bennett wrote to each other regularly all during that period. Bennett sent Donald long newsy letters about the book businessÃ¢â‚¬â€authors, sales, publishing gossipÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as about what was happening in New York. Donald reacted in his wise, serene way to BennettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s letters, and conveyed news of what was going on in the war, though sometimes censorship took its toll.\n\nThis is nostalgia with substance, and because these letters were never intended to be read by anyone else, they reveal, in a convincing and wonderful way, just how special these two men were and how that specialness was reflected in the company they founded","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42fe9bd35b8ef1e32c42d110fe8226a1c2b7ab6e","amp;dn":"War+Time+Letters+of+Bennett+Cerf+and+Donald+Klopfer+%282011%29+%28136p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42fe9bd35b8ef1e32c42d110fe8226a1c2b7ab6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,254,155,211,91,142,241,227,44,66,209,16,254,130,38,161,194,183,171,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
