It features twelve tracks by artists from South Africa. The sleeve notes state that all songs are in the mbaqanga style, a guitar-based style popular at the time in the townships of Johannesburg and Durban, but the tracks actually cover four different styles, mbaqanga, mqashiyo, maskanda, and isicathamiya.[2] The former two are the least traditional-sounding of the styles, while the latter two styles incorporate elements of urban and more rural music. Released prior to the more commercially successful Graceland by Paul Simon, it was one of the first albums of contemporary South African music to be widely available outside the country.[2]\n\nThe album has been re-released several times and also spawned a succession of later volumes in the Indestructible Beat series, released by the Earthworks label.\n\nThe album was placed in the top 10 in the annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll in the magazine The Village Voice.[4] Allmusic calls it &quot;an essential sampler of modern African styling, a revelation and a joy.&quot;[5] Leading critic Robert Christgau gave it an A+ rating,[6] and called it the most important record of the 1980s.[7] It was ranked number 388 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.[8]\n\n1\tAwungilobolele \tUdokotela Shange Namajaha 3:49 \t\t\n2\tHolotelani \tNelcy Sedibe 3:59 \t\t\n3\tQhude Manikiniki \tUmahlathini Nabo 3:53 \t\t\n4\tIndoda Yejazi Elimnyama \tAmaswazi Emvelo 3:55 \t\t\n5\tEmthonjeni Womculo \tMahlathini Nezintombi Zomgqashiyo 3:44 \t\t\n6\tSobabamba \tUdokotela Shange Namajaha 3:39 \t\t\n7\tQhwayilahle \tMoses Mchunu 4:18 \t\t\n8\tThul'ulalele \tAmaswazi Emvelo 3:40 \t\t\n9\tSini Lindile \tNganeziyamfisa No Khambalomvaleliso 3:21 \t\t\n10\tNgicabange Ngaqeda \tMahlathini Nezintombi Zomgqashiyo 3:03 \t\t\n11\tJoyce No. 2 \tJohnson Mkhalali 3:09 \t\t\n12\tNansi Imali \tLadysmith Black Mambazo 5:14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb76f9b20a18746d920ab3398cc06c4af8b2a0af","amp;dn":"Indestructible+Beat+Of+Soweto+-%5B1985%5D-+Volume+One+%28320K%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb76f9b20a18746d920ab3398cc06c4af8b2a0af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,118,249,178,10,24,116,109,146,10,179,57,140,192,108,74,248,178,160,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
