It's a great team-up and a fun story that highlights both mens' strengths and differences. Especially poignant given Slott's Superior Spider-Man is soon to end and Parker will be back as Spider-Man soon! Brian Michael Bendis, who more or less created the Ultimate Spider-Man from the ground up, writes this nice little one-off tale. This digital copy is thanks to Zone-Empire, much appreciated as always. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f879dca09192b322ab041013950e056c5ce7c5b9","amp;dn":"Spider-Men+01-05+%282012%2C+Digital%2C+Zone-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f879dca09192b322ab041013950e056c5ce7c5b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,121,220,160,145,146,179,34,171,4,16,19,149,14,5,108,92,231,197,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
