As per usual, I didn't see a collected torrent for this week's Marvel NOW! titles yet, so I thought I'd upload one. \nIncluded are:\n\n\nAvengers Assemble 023.INH\nGuardians of the Galaxy 011.NOW\nInhumanity 002\nSuperior Spider-Man 026\nThor - God Of Thunder 018\nThunderbolts 021\nUncanny Avengers 016\nUncanny X-Force 017\nX-Men Legacy 023\n\nAlso:\nREVOLUTIONARY WAR: KNIGHTS OF PENDRAGON #1\nPart 3 of &quot;Revolutionary War&quot;\n* A corporate deep-mining setup unearths an old MYS-TECH base, where magical cloning experiments have been taking place.\n* What mysteries or monsters are waiting in BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subterranean bones?\n* Featuring fan-favorite Marvel UK characters Dai Thomas, Pete Wisdom, and Union Jack!\n\n\nIf you like them and have the money, BUY THEM and support your favorite creators, writers, artists, local comic shops and publishers. \n\nSeriously, buy the comics you have money for. But only the ones you think deserve your money-- vote with your dollars, and also make your voices heard. Marvel has a pretty good internet presence, which also means they read emails, tweets, tumblr responses, facebook comments. They've shown that they are solely focused on sales numbers-- vote with yr money, and tell them with words (not curses). They WILL listen, eventually. You know-- the internets.\n\nAll my thanks to all the uploaders and scanners and seeders out there! Enjoy! (and seed!)\n\nPS: I got a new job (THANK YOU LORDS OF THE ECONOMY! I WAS BROKE AS FUCK! MY BANK ACCOUNT BALANCE IS ZEROED OUT! AND IT WILL BE FOR ANOTHER MONTH!) so the next few weekly Marvel NOW! compilations may not be out day of release, until I get my schedule sorted. Just so, you know, anybody feels like picking up the slack from my laziness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:407056f063df977fa8d7997b1847b32bb5293727","amp;dn":"Marvel+NOW%21+Week+63%2FAll-New+Marvel+NOW%21+Week+6+01%2F29%2F2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"407056f063df977fa8d7997b1847b32bb5293727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,112,86,240,99,223,151,127,168,215,153,123,24,71,179,43,181,41,55,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
