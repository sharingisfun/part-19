James Woolsey, members of the US Senate and senior UN officials.\n\nIn addition to these disclosures, &quot;Hidden Truth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Forbidden Knowledge&quot; unveils the actual contact experiences Dr. Greer has had with UFOs and Extraterrestrial Civilizations, beginning as a young child. In one of the most amazing and moving personal stories ever shared, he explains how after a prolonged near-death experience at age 17, he experienced cosmic consciousness and found the Rosetta Stone of ET contact: the power of the unbounded mind within each of us. Later this led to numerous Close Encounters of the 5th Kind: contact with ETs initiated by Dr. Greer and later by larger groups of people through the CSETI (Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence) project.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41098bdde6f8e5439e8f58035327c0f585a6e124","amp;dn":"Hidden+Truth%2C+Forbidden+Knowledge+%28Steven+Greer%29+ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41098bdde6f8e5439e8f58035327c0f585a6e124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,9,139,221,230,248,229,67,158,143,88,3,83,39,192,245,133,166,225,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
