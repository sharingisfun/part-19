However, finding where to begin can be challenging. This book serves as an ideal starting point for programming on the Mac OS X Snow Leopard platform. Step-by-step instructions walk you through the details of each featured example so that you can type them out, run them, and even figure out how to debug them when they don't work right. Taking into account that there is usually more than one way to do something when programming, the authors encourage you to experiment with a variety of solutions. This approach enables you to efficiently start writing programs in Mac OS X Snow Leopard using myriad languages and put those languages together in order to create seamless applications.\n\nCoverage Includes:\n\n   * The Mac OS X Environment\n   * Developer Tools\n   * Xcode\n   * Interface Builder\n   * The C Language\n   * The Objective-C Language\n   * An Introduction to Cocoa\n   * Document-Based Cocoa Applications\n   * Core DataÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Based Cocoa Applications\n   * An Overview of Scripting Languages\n   * The Bash Shell\n   * AppleScript and AppleScriptObjC\n   * Javascript, Dashboard, and Dashcode\n\nNote: CD-ROM/DVD and other supplementary materials are not included as part of eBook file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc8c641ccd7a0db47548fb64734df0be2703ba41","amp;dn":"Beginning+Mac+OS+X+Snow+Leopard+Programming+%287Summits%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc8c641ccd7a0db47548fb64734df0be2703ba41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,140,100,28,205,122,13,180,117,72,251,100,115,77,240,190,39,3,186,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
