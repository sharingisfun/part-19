Well, it is apparently only this lone Women of Marvel One-Shot. What? Seriously, this is the whole &quot;Volume 2&quot; of X-23! Anyway, regardless of that moronic numbering, this is still worth reading as it is written by the excellent Marjorie Liu - who also handled her ongoing series and tied into it - and features some great art by Felipe Andrade and Nuno Alves. Thanks to Minutemen for the scan, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:648aa39b85fcb8e865f5a94da9123dbd96fd7304","amp;dn":"X-23+%28X23%29+v2+001+%282010%7CC2C%7COne-Shot%7CMinutemen-Rocn+King%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"648aa39b85fcb8e865f5a94da9123dbd96fd7304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,138,163,155,133,252,184,232,101,245,169,77,169,18,61,189,150,253,115,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
