Hudnall. It centered on a disparate group of people with various psychic powers who are brought together under duress and later coalesce as a team. Espers was published intermittently in the 1980s and 1990s by four different companies, including Eclipse, Marvel, and Image, and was re-numbered from issue 1 again each time.\n\nThis is the seven-issue run done for Image Comics in 1997, with Greg Horn providing artwork and covers. The TPB of the Eclipse series can be found here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8197588/Espers_(epic_Comics). The epic Comics 'Interface' series is here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8201824/Interface_(epic_Comics).\n\nThe six-issue, 1996 run done for Hudnall's own Halloween Comics is still needed. Image Comics also collected this run in the 1998 TPB, &quot;Espers: Undertow&quot;. If anyone has it, PLEASE upload it!\n\nAs always, all praise to the creative team and original scanners.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b17466718da9df77ec9f1caab65c5a3326badf3","amp;dn":"Espers+%28Image+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b17466718da9df77ec9f1caab65c5a3326badf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,23,70,103,24,218,157,247,126,201,241,202,171,101,197,163,50,107,173,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
