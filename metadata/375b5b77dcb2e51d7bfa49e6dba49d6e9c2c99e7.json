It introduced new readers to the work of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and other Marvel creators, and packaged the material in a traditional book format that carried more cachÃƒÂ© than the flimsy pamphlet style of a typical comic book. Many of the books featured painted covers illustrated by such artists as Bob Larkin, John Romita, Sr., and Earl Norem. In this way, the series was an antecedent to the now common practice of packaging &quot;classic&quot; stories into archival editions and trade paperback collections including Marvel's 1998 book Grandson of Origins of Marvel Comics.\n\n------\n\nOne of the very first graphic novels, THE SILVER SURFER is written by Stan &quot;The Man&quot; Lee, pencilled by the late Jack &quot;King&quot; Kirby and inked by &quot;Joltin'&quot; Joe Sinnott. I think this was Lee &amp; Kirby's last direct collaboration. It is certainly the only one of the Fireside books that is both a &quot;real&quot; comic book story and not a reprint.\n\nIf you know anything about Marvel history, Kirby had left for DC (when he created the New Gods and Darkseid) and part of his agreement to return to Marvel was he and Lee would produce this 100-plus page original graphic novel. It is truly awesome.\n\nI don't think this takes place on the Marvel Universe Earth. No Fantastic Four or other guest stars, just Surfer and Galactus.\n\nAnd I actually don't think this has ever been reprinted anywhere. I haven't researched it, but I suspect the copyright is held up by Simon &amp; Schuster or by the estate of Jack Kirby. The copyright page in the book actually says it belongs to Stan &amp; Jack and the work is based on characters owned by Marvel (in turn owned by Cadence). Very interesting.\n\nAs far as torrents go, I checked but couldn't find this book included in the Silver Surfer Comics on DVD torrent or the Silver Surfer Chronology series of torrents. I just don't think it's anywhere on TPB.\n\nAll credit to the original scanner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375b5b77dcb2e51d7bfa49e6dba49d6e9c2c99e7","amp;dn":"THE+SILVER+SURFER+%281978%29+Stan+Lee+and+Jack+Kirby+%28Fireside%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375b5b77dcb2e51d7bfa49e6dba49d6e9c2c99e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,91,91,119,220,178,229,29,123,250,73,230,219,164,157,110,156,44,153,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
