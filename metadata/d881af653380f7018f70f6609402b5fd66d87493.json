It offers new understanding of a bright, complex woman whose surprising rise and sudden demise changed music forever.\r\n\r\nJanis Joplin is one of the most revered singers of all time. She thrilled millions of listeners with her powerful, soulful voice and blazed new creative trails before her death in 1971 at the age of 27. The film includes some of her most iconic performances which embodied the musical and cultural revolution of the 1960s.\r\n\r\nYet her onstage bravado and uninhibited sexual persona hid hurt and insecurity stemming from her childhood in conservative Texas. On relocating to San Francisco and discovering the blues, Janis found an outlet for her loneliness and fell into a community that would embrace and celebrate her talent.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 824 MiB\r\nDuration : 1h 29mn\r\nOverall bit rate : 1 295 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate : 1 200 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d881af653380f7018f70f6609402b5fd66d87493","amp;dn":"BBC+Janis+Joplin+-+Little+Girl+Blue+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d881af653380f7018f70f6609402b5fd66d87493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,129,175,101,51,128,247,1,143,112,246,96,148,2,181,253,102,216,116,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
