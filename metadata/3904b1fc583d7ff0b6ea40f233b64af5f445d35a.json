Returning troops and exhausted industrial workers were promised a land fit for heroes, but instead found widespread poverty and political discontent.\r\nThe first of this three-part series examines the turbulent political situation that was emerging in Scotland, and the new era of class politics that was to materialise.\r\n\r\nHomes for Highland Heroes\r\nScotland: The Promised Land Episode 2 of 3\r\nThe second film in this series examines the grave problems facing Scotland's Highlands and Islands in the turbulent decade after the Great War. A deepening crisis was emerging as landowners went bankrupt, while crofters went hungry, starved of land. The future was indeed bleak for those who stayed and, for those who wanted out, subsidised passages to Britain's dominions awaited.\r\n\r\nThe Cultural Revolution\r\nScotland: The Promised Land Episode 3 of 3\r\nIn the wake of the Great War, two visions of Scotland emerged - a nationalist cultural resurgence led by a band of writers, and a popular revival that appealed to the masses. The final film in this series examines the struggle between these two ideologies, charting the remarkable transformation of those who helped give birth to the modern Scotland we know today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3904b1fc583d7ff0b6ea40f233b64af5f445d35a","amp;dn":"Scotland-The.Promised.Land--BBC-2016-w.subs-468p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3904b1fc583d7ff0b6ea40f233b64af5f445d35a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,4,177,252,88,61,127,240,182,234,64,242,51,182,74,245,244,69,211,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
