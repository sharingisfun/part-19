To implement and enforce the Convention and verify the ongoing elimination of declared chemical weapons production capacity and stockpiles, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspects military and industrial sites in dozens of countries. This book provides an in-depth explanation of the notable achievements of the Chemical Weapons Convention in a relatively short span since 1997, and examines the issues that must be addressed to ensure the regime's continuing vitality in the context of dynamic changes in the security environment, and in science, industry and technology.\n\n\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n5.0 out of 5 stars A Report on the Current State of the Treaty November 30, 2006\nBy John Matlock\nFormat:Paperback\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is an arms control agreement which outlaws the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. It is the last of three conventions or treaties that propose to control weapons of mass destruction (WMD), with the first two intended to control nuclear and biological weapons.\n\nThe CWC, being the last of these agreements to go into effect is probably the best written, most strongly enforced of the agreements. It is the only one with on site inspection capability built into the treaty. It became open for signature in 1993 and entered in force on April 29, 1997.\n\nThe overwhelming number of nations in the world have signed and ratified the convention. Some dozen states have signed but not yet ratified, i.e. Bahamas, Djibouti, Haiti, etc. Ten states have neither signed or agreed. Some of these: Vanuatu, Barbados, have no chemical industry to speak of and are immaterial. Some of the others: North Korea, Syria are very serious problems.\n\nThis book is written by a series of authors that are specialists in various aspects of the convention and present a report on the current state of the treaty.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nRamesh Thakur is a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and professor of political science at the University of Waterloo, Canada.
