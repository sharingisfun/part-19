Produced by Greg Wells, Cedar + Gold continues the more instrumentally fleshed-out electric and electronic sound that the largely acoustic-oriented Prettyman explored on Hello...x. This newfound musical maturity also extends into her songwriting, as Cedar + Gold features some of the most introspective, self-examinational, and emotionally raw songs of her career. In that sense, such tracks as the passionate &quot;Second Chance&quot; and the rambling country-blues-inflected &quot;My Oh My,&quot; with their anthemic, soulful melodies and dancey percussion, bring to mind such similarly inclined contemporaries as Colbie Caillat, Mat Kearney, and even the operatic uplift of Florence + the Machine. As Prettyman and Mraz's relationship was a public one, with the couple often performing together on tour, it's fairly clear what such songs as &quot;Second Chance,&quot; &quot;Quit You,&quot; and, most obviously, &quot;I Was Gonna Marry You,&quot; are about. But rather than coming off as mere diary entries set to music, Prettyman displays a true craftsman's touch. The cuts on Cedar + Gold are both personal and universally relatable, with melodies that stick in your head and tug at your heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df00e1c15b10adc83d9f097d552a33ea3fb259b","amp;dn":"Tristan+Prettyman+-+Cedar+and+Gold+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df00e1c15b10adc83d9f097d552a33ea3fb259b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,240,14,28,21,177,10,220,131,217,240,151,213,82,163,62,163,251,37,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
