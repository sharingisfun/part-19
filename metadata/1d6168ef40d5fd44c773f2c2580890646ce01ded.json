Most of the film consists of clips from Dean&amp;#039;s three starring pictures (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant), with tantalizing glimpses of his pre-star career. One such glimpse, a snippet from the 1951 TV religious special Hill Number One, has popped up in virtually every Dean retrospective since. Altman&amp;#039;s inherent cinematic gifts are evident in the impressionistic &quot;re-enactment&quot; of Dean&amp;#039;s fatal auto crash. Narrated by Martin Gabel, The James Dean Story isn&amp;#039;t terribly deep, but it&amp;#039;s a good shorthand overview of one of the most powerful screen presences of the 1950s.\n\n \nProduced by \n \nWarner Brothers \n \nAMG Video ID \n \nV    25796 \n \nCorrections to this Entry? \n \n Lew Brocker  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nMr. Carter  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nPatsy D&amp;#039;Amore  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nJames Dean  - [Archival Appearance]  \nMr. Dean  - Dean&amp;#039;s Grandfather  \nLouis de Liso  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nMartin Gabel    \nAdelaide Hall  - Dean&amp;#039;s Drama Teacher  \nRobert Jewett  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nJohn Kalin  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nLili Kardell  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nBilly Karen  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nArnie Langer  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nJerry Luce  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nOfficer Nelson  - Highway Patrolman  \nGeorge Ross  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nArline Sax  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nBig Traster  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nChristine White  - &quot;Dean&amp;#039;s Friend&quot;  \nMarcus Winslow  - Dean&amp;#039;s Uncle  \nMarkie Winslow  - Dean&amp;#039;s Cousin  \nOrtense Winslow  - Dean&amp;#039;s Aunt  \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6168ef40d5fd44c773f2c2580890646ce01ded","amp;dn":"The+James+Dean+Story+-+1957+Robert+Altman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6168ef40d5fd44c773f2c2580890646ce01ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,97,104,239,64,213,253,68,199,115,242,194,88,8,144,100,108,224,29,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
