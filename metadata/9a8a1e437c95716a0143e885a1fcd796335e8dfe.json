But behind the idyllic veneer lie disturbing rumors of missing students and questionable treatments.\n\nJules Farentino knows her half-sister, Shaylee, has been going off the rails lately. She's just not sure Blue Rock Academy is the answer. Accepting a teaching position there lets Jules keep an eye on Shay, but also confirms her fears. One student is found hanged, another near death. Something sinister is at hand--and Jules may already be too late to stop it.\n\nAs a brutal snowstorm sweeps in, cutting off the remote campus from the rest of the world, Jules will discover the Academy's dark secrets, and confront a murderous evil without limits, without remorse, without mercy. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a8a1e437c95716a0143e885a1fcd796335e8dfe","amp;dn":"Without+Mercy+by+Lisa+Jackson+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a8a1e437c95716a0143e885a1fcd796335e8dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,138,30,67,124,149,113,106,1,67,232,133,161,252,215,150,51,94,141,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
