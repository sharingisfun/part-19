Though a number of different characters have taken the name &quot;Shadowman&quot;, the first Valiant incarnation presented here remains on of the best and most beloved - a man in a simple carnival mask compelled to stalk the streets, seeking vengeance. The amazing amount of talent that has worked on this title is quite impressive as well, to quote the list from wikipedia: &quot;A tremendous roster of legendary creators have worked on Shadowman characters and storylines including current Marvel Comics Editor-in Chief Joe Quesada, former Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter, Sin City co-director Frank Miller, Garth Ennis, Rob Liefeld, Barry Windsor-Smith, Jamie Delano, Steve Ditko, David Lapham, Rags Morales, Fabian Nicieza, Jim Starlin, Bob Layton, Jimmy Palmiotti, Walt Simonson and Ashley Wood among many others.&quot; Can't get much better than that, all with a nice voodoo/jazz vibe! :-)\n\nThis torrent contains all issues from 00-43 as well as the Yearbook special. The first 13 issues (00-12) are all digital courtesy of Vee-Empire, and the rest are unknown. Thanks to all the scanners and original uploaders - I found most of this on h33t ready to go - and please seed and enjoy! :-)\n\nThis fills a request for mothra67.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61753c2bda302495ccb7b35c7a48b77592476fa7","amp;dn":"Shadowman+v1+00-43+%2B+Yearbook+%281992-1995%2C+Dgtl%2BScans%2C+Vee-E%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61753c2bda302495ccb7b35c7a48b77592476fa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,117,60,43,218,48,36,149,204,183,179,92,122,72,183,117,146,71,111,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
