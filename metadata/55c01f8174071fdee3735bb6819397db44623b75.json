Packet Tracer makes both \n\nteaching and learning easier - instructors and students can create their \n\nown virtual &quot;network worlds&quot; for exploration, experimentation, and \n\nexplanation of networking concepts and technologies.\n\nInstructors can demonstrate technologies and configurations using Packet \n\nTracer to teach complex CCNA-level networking concepts, making it \n\nextremely useful for lectures, group and individual labs, assessments, \n\ntroubleshooting and modeling tasks, homework, games, and competitions. \n\nIt supplements classroom equipment and provides students complementary \n\nlearning opportunities that are not possible in the classroom alone. In \n\naddition, Packet Tracer activities are embedded in the new CCNA \n\nDiscovery and CCNA Exploration curricula to provide rich networking \n\ntechnology learning experiences.\n\nPT offers a unique combination of realistic simulation and visualization \n\nexperiences, complex assessment and activity authoring capabilities, and \n\nopportunities for multiuser collaboration and competition.\n\nPacket Tracer v5.1 Software Downloads\nPacket Tracer version 5.1 is a major new release that includes \n\nadditional functionality not available in Packet Tracer version 4.11. \n\nWhile there are no curricula requirements that make it necessary to move \n\nto PT5.1, you may want to upgrade to the new version to take advantage \n\nof the improvements and new features included in this release.PT5.1 \n\nsupports activities authored in Packet Tracer 4.0, 4.1 and 4.11. and \n\n5.0.
