Now we are inclining for a way more blocky look, but for a real  good reason.  We have added lots of locations, towns and stories to explore, we are finally making that exploration game we were looking forward to do.\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“planetsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ still have circular gravity plus a day and night cycle. Sure now they are way blockier but they also feel much more alive with all the things to explore and learn. We are planning to add way more locations, towns , and stories and more planets obviously.\n\nWe also worked on the UIÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. alot\n\nAs new updates come out the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s universe is going to be getting bigger and bigger with more everything!. We hope you enjoy this new update.&quot;\n\nEnjoy, seed, and remember to buy the game!23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a63ebcde65aed45453280c33ed820c6832b60a","amp;dn":"Infinite+Pixels--Alpha+0.2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42a63ebcde65aed45453280c33ed820c6832b60a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,166,62,188,222,101,174,212,84,83,40,12,51,237,130,12,104,50,182,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
