Hugh Laurie stars as Gregory House in the global hit TV series House, as well as finding time to fit in Hollywood movies, voiceovers for major cartoons, comedy, music and to write best selling novel The Gun Seller.\n\nStephen Fry says: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI am delighted to be given the opportunity to retread the 30 years Hugh and I have known each other and worked together. It was a great joy reminiscing about our times together and I hope GOLD viewers enjoy watching us grow older and olderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThroughout the programme, Stephen and Hugh open up, revealing fascinating insights into their friendship and their careers, and take a look back at their sketches, interspersed with hilarious clips from their work.\n\nFilming revealed some funny insights into the pair; Fry and Laurie have different versions of how they met although they both concede they were introduced by Emma Thompson.\n\nThe pair are great friends and their careers have intertwined frequently over the years from Jeeves and Wooster to Blackadder to their joint comedy showcase, A Bit of Fry and Laurie which ran on BBC1 and BBC2 for four series between 1989 and 1995. They started working together as students in Cambridge at Footlights, and their Footlights May Week Revue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Cellar Tapes, won the first ever Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival in 1981. The show was subsequently recorded and transmitted by the BBC in 1982.  From there they worked on a number of shows together including Saturday Live and Blackadder and of course A Bit of Fry and Laurie which ran for four series from 1989 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1995.\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Fry and Laurie ReunitedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ one-off special will air on GOLD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ November 24th, 9pm.\n\n\n--- File Information ---\n\nFile Name:                         Fry.And.Laurie.Reunited.PDTV.XviD-Thebox.DaveUK.avi\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):       1:08:41\nFile Size (in bytes):           583,483,392\n\n--- Video Information ---\n\nVideo Codec Name:          XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Duration:                1:08:41\nframe Width (pixels):       624\nframe Height (pixels):      352\nframes Per Second:         25.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):        995\n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                      \nAudio Codec:                    MP3\nAudio Sample Rate:          48000 Hz\nAudio BitRate Type:         CBR\nAudio Channels                 2\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):         128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b064aeafd2b2ba3bca73d453df4b1fddbcb1431","amp;dn":"Fry+and+Laurie+Reunited+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b064aeafd2b2ba3bca73d453df4b1fddbcb1431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,6,74,234,253,43,43,163,188,167,61,69,61,244,177,253,219,203,20,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
