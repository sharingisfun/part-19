I expect there'll be what I believe is called an &quot;intervention&quot; soon. I keep picturing it. All my friends bearing down on me and me denying everything until my pockets are emptied. Oh the shame'\n\nIn his early thirties, Stephen Fry - writer, comedian, star of stage and screen - had, as they say, 'made it'. Much loved in A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster, author of a critically acclaimed and bestselling first novel, The Liar, with a glamorous and glittering cast of friends, he had more work than was perhaps good for him.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\n\nThe author and reader\n\nStephen Fry is a leading light in film, theatre, radio and television the world over, receiving accolades in spades and plaudits by the shovel. As a writer, producer, director, actor and presenter he has featured in works as varied and adored as the movie 'Wilde', the TV series 'Blackadder' and 'Jeeves and Wooster', the sketch show 'A Bit of Fry and Laurie', the panel game 'QI', the radio series 'Fry's English Delight', Shakespeare's Globe's celebrated 2012 production of 'Twelfth Night' (as Malvolio) and documentaries on countless subjects very close to his heart.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:defb0300d59d675fc93afa8019553db1706cf969","amp;dn":"More+Fool+Me+-+Stephen+Fry++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"defb0300d59d675fc93afa8019553db1706cf969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,251,3,0,213,157,103,95,201,58,250,128,25,85,61,177,112,108,249,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
