It would be hard to quarrel with anyone who chooses Leontyne Price in the 1967 Herbert von Karajan recording over Angela Gheorghiu, or Luciano Pavarotti over Roberto Alagna; the differences are slight and a matter of personal taste. But this is the most intensely dramatic of Verdi's works, including no less a climax than the flaming end of the world, and Claudio Abbado treats the composer's vision even more powerfully than von Karajan, with a magnificent orchestra and chorus at his disposal.\n\n\n\nGiuseppe Verdi\n\nRequiem\n\n\n\nAngela Gheorghiu\n\nRoberto Alagna\n\nDaniela Barcellona\n\nJulian Konstantinov\n\n\n\nSwedish Radio Chorus\n\nEric Ericson Chamber Choir\n\nBerlin Philharmonic Orchestra\n\n\n\nClaudio Abbado\n\n\n\nFilmed during performances commemorating the centenary of Verdi's death, 25 &amp; 27 January 2001\n\n\n\nEnglish,French and German subtitles included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a07c4f64f8a306607f129cda916a8f38970240f1","amp;dn":"Verdi+-+Requiem+-+Gheorghiu%2C+Alagna%2C+Abbado+%28AC3+Xvid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a07c4f64f8a306607f129cda916a8f38970240f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,124,79,100,248,163,6,96,127,18,156,218,145,106,143,56,151,2,64,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
