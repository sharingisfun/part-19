We are planning to support X-Plane in the near future. \n\nFS Global Real Weather not only delivers weather data calculated out of realtime data of more than 24.000 observation stations (land- and seabased) worldwide. It also calculates air masses and temperatues for upper airlevels on a scientific base, which is absolutely necessary for correct flight planning using real world tools. As a first in history of FS weather tools it supports local weather phaenomena (e.g. Foehn weather at Innsbruck; LOWI). It is available as a download and sometimes later as a boxed version. \n\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT RELEASE\nVersion 1.7 Build #024 was released on August 20th 2014 and contains the following changes:\n      .) FS Global Real Weather can now be used with Prepar3D 2.3.\n      .) A bug that caused many weather stations to have wrong ground temperatures in FS2004 was fixed.\n\nPlease also take note, that due to our relay with Lockheed Martin the white flicker when updating weather has been fixed for Prepar3D V2.3.
