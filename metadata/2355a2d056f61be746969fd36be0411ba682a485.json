The [GLP &amp; MEMM] pricing models are clearly introduced, and the properties of these models are discussed in great detail. It is shown that the geometric LÃƒÂ©vy process (GLP) is a typical example of the incomplete market, and that the MEMM (minimal entropy martingale measure) is an extremely powerful pricing measure.\n\nThis volume also presents the calibration procedure of the [GLP &amp; MEMM] model that has been widely used in the application of practical problems.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBasic Concepts in Mathematical Finance\nLÃƒÂ©vy Processes and Geometric LÃƒÂ©vy Process Models\nEquivalent Martingale Measures\nEsscher Transformed Martingale Measures\nMinimax Martingale Measures and Minimal Distance Martingale Measures\nMinimal Distance Martingale Measures for Geometric LÃƒÂ©vy Processes\nThe [GLP &amp; MEMM] Pricing Model\nCalibration and Fitness Analysis of the [GLP &amp; MEMM] Model\nThe [GSP &amp; MEMM] Pricing Model\nThe Multi-Dimensional [GLP &amp; MEMM] Pricing Model","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2355a2d056f61be746969fd36be0411ba682a485","amp;dn":"Option+Pricing+in+Incomplete+Markets%3A+Modeling+Based+on+Geometri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2355a2d056f61be746969fd36be0411ba682a485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,85,162,208,86,246,27,231,70,150,159,211,107,224,65,27,166,130,164,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
