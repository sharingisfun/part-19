Retargeting gives advertisers the ability to stay in front of those people to bring them back and close the deal. For that reason, retargeting has emerged as a must have marketing channel, yet there is a lack of content that explains how the technology actually works and best practices for using it. Even marketing managers at large, sophisticated brands and agencies donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a strong grasp of this evolving channel, and there are few good neutral sources on the topic. Meanwhile, retargeting is the cornerstone of any holistic digital advertising strategy since it improves the results of every other channel if implemented correctly. Unfortunately, most marketers are only utilizing the most rudimentary retargeting tactics and barely scratch the surface of its potential.\n\nExplains how to stay in front of potential customers and convince them to come back and close the deal\nThis book will be required reading for media buyers at digital agencies, in-house marketing managers at companies in any vertical, performance marketers, and ecommerce managers.\n\nFrom the Inside Flap\nGetting customers to your website is only half the battle. The question is, are they converting? In The Retargeting Playbook: How to Turn Web-Window Shoppers into Customers, industry thought leaders Adam Berke, Greg Fulton, and Lauren Vaccarello discuss how retargeting (or remarketing as it is sometimes called) can be used to increase conversions and win customers that would have otherwise been lost. Many people visit a website but only comparison shop or get distracted instead of buying. Advertisers can gauge buying intent from the visit, but can they use that information in an intelligent way to increase the likelihood of a conversion? By learning the technology of retargeting and the best practices for using this marketing strategy, advertisers can bring these people back and close the deal.\n\nBased on hundreds of thousands of retargeting campaigns across all industry vehicles, The Retargeting Playbook pulls together real-world case studies from leading brands to discuss proper use of the technology and make it accessible to marketers at companies of all sizes. It is more than just showing ads to people who have already visited your website; it is using the right skills and knowledge to unlock the opportunities that make retargeting an effective marketing practice. Retargeting is the cornerstone of any holistic digital advertising strategy.\n\nHistorically only available to large brands and agencies, retargeting can improve the results of every other marketing channel if it is implemented correctly. But marketers who currently use it are often employing rudimentary tactics that barely scratch the surface of its potential. Berke, Fulton, and Vaccarello want to share the retargeting secrets that have been locked up for years with technology vendors and a few savvy ad agencies. Built on decades of experience, The Retargeting Playbook is the only neutral, authoritative resource on the market to explain how retargeting technology works and how to properly use it to positively impact your bottom line.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nPRAISE FOR THE RETARGETING PLAYBOOK\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I LOVE this book.
