The ingredients are the same: beautifull themes, contrast, silence, some electronics, acoustic jazz, building up to climax etc.\nAll this is found on Viaticum too. What apeals to me on this album is the subtlety in the pianoplaying: every note is in the right place, and there's a great balance between free and melodic parts. The band as a whole sounds a bit more like a traditional jazz-band then on the other albums, but still in the unique EST-vocabulary. The classical or folkthemes you can hear on the other albums are a little less prominent on this album. The drumming is a little bit more laid-back, if possible.\n\nSometimes it's very sad to see that good musicians don't get recognised enough for the things they are doing. And most of the time not because of the people being to stupid to recognise greatness or beauty, but because of comercial and not cultural considerations. When a lot of American jazzmusicians have that problem, what about Scandinavian? E.S.T. must be heared. Buy the album (or another one of E.S.T.) and spred the gospel of Scandinavian jazz!\n(review, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\n\nEsbjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Svensson Trio - Viaticum 2005\n(MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nchen Act)\n\n1.
