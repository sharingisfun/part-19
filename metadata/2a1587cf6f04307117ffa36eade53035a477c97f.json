American Restoration now follows five of the best restoration shops in the United States (Bodie Stroud Industries, Wheels Through Time, Monkey Business, Steveâ€™s Restorations, Bobâ€™s Garage), while they not only restore pieces of Americaâ€™s history, but create new works from vintage items. Each shop has a unique focus, from classic cars, to rare antique signs, to one-of-a-kind bikes. The series will not only illustrate the restoration process; it will also explore the items original glory, place in history and impact on pop culture.
