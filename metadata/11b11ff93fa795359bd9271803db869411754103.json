The album will feature a new member in the band as well, upping the number of members to three, a one Keaton Snyder will be featured on the vibraphone.\n\n&quot;while indie rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s go-to guy, phil ek (built to spill, fleet foxes, the shins), hopped behind the boards this time, the dodos wildly-percussive style is still centered around two key elements: the punchy percussion of logan kroeber and the fahey-infused finger-picking of frontman meric long. oh sure, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll hear a horn blast here and there, but its never enough to distract you from the groups riffs and rolls.&quot; - http://bolachasgratis.baywords.com/?p=7556\n\n    ALBUM REVIEW FROM INDIE SHUFFLE\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.indieshuffle.com/?p=459&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.indieshuffle.com/?p=459&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    sounds like : fleet foxes, animal collective, the shins, against me (acoustic)\n\n    the dodos are back! one of my favorite bands of 2008, these san francisco natives have dropped their third full-length album, and while it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite match up to 2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s visiter, i have to say that iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not disappointed. their typical slow-build-up approach packs all the energy it used to, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s certainly one of those albums that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be hard-pressed to avoid foot-tapping to.\n\n    reading around, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s become apparent that the once-duo has now become a trio, with 21-year-old keaton snyder backing up on the vibraphone. iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be honest: he hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t changed the sound much. i have no doubt he makes for a more robust touring team, but with the exception of the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“this is a businessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“, the dodos seem to have maintained their sound. and while theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve played a number of larger venues throughout the u.s. (particularly in s.f.), iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m just not quite sure theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve struck the right chord on this album to break out (oh, but they already have, you might say!). all that aside, iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d still recommend you check out this album. theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still a band that i enjoy to listen toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“though visiter takes the pie. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11b11ff93fa795359bd9271803db869411754103","amp;dn":"The+Dodos+-+Time+To+Die+%282009%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11b11ff93fa795359bd9271803db869411754103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,177,31,249,63,167,149,53,155,217,39,24,3,219,134,148,17,117,65,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
