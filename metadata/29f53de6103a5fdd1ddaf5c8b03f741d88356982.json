Do women have better\npoker faces than men? WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the most existential poker movie\never made? Is life more meaningful when you go all-in? Is\nonline poker really still poker? Poker and Philosophy ponders\nthese questions and more, pitting young lions against old\nmasters as the brashness of Phil Hellmuth meets the arrogance\nof Socrates, the recklessness of Doyle Brunson challenges the\ndesperation of Dostoyevsky, and the coolness of Chris Moneymaker\ntakes on the American tradition of capitalist ingenuity. This\nwitty collection of essays demonstrates what serious card sharks\nhave long known: winning big takes more than a good hand and a\nstraight face. Stacking the metaphorical deck with a serious\ngrounding in philosophy is the key to raking it in, because as\nMachiavelli proved long ago, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot better to be feared\nthan loved, and lying is not the same as cheating.\n\nPoker and Philosophy: Pocket Rockets\nand Philosopher Kings\nBy: Eric Bronson\nISBN13: 9780812698107\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 493","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f53de6103a5fdd1ddaf5c8b03f741d88356982","amp;dn":"Poker+and+Philosophy+Pocket+Rockets+and+Philosopher+Kings+by+Eri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f53de6103a5fdd1ddaf5c8b03f741d88356982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,245,61,230,16,58,95,221,29,218,245,200,176,63,116,29,136,53,105,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
