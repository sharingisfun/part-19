Ã¢â‚¬Å“I wanted to make something that felt genuine. We recorded everything with analogue gear and mixed it on tape, which gives the songs a raw and vulnerable feeling.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe title Isakov chose for the record reflects the nature of his external surroundings as much as his inner experiences. References to the weather are a reoccurring theme in IsakovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing, but there is a deeper meaning behind the name.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“To me, the idea of a weatherman is really powerful. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a guy on television or on the radio telling us the future, and nobody cares. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this daily mundane miracle, and I think the songs I chose are about noticing the beauty in normal, everyday life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:027b482c636255c07272a67b07ecbb44ecd2fc71","amp;dn":"Gregory+Alan+Isakov+-+The+Weatherman+%5B2013%5D%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"027b482c636255c07272a67b07ecbb44ecd2fc71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,123,72,44,99,98,85,192,114,114,166,123,7,236,187,68,236,210,252,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
