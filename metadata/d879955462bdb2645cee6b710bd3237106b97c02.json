It reveals the grave risk of running the 21st centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s software Ã¢â‚¬â€ our know-how Ã¢â‚¬â€ on the ancient hardware of our primate brain which hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been upgraded in 50,000 years. With rich imagery and immersive soundtrack, filmmakers Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks launch us on journey to contemplate our evolution from cave-dwellers to space explorers.\n\nRonald Wright, whose best-seller, Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Short History Of ProgressÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ inspired this film, reveals how civilizations are repeatedly destroyed by Ã¢â‚¬Å“progress trapsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ alluring technologies serve immediate needs, but ransom the future. With intersecting stories from a Chinese car-driving club, a Wall Street insider who exposes an out-of-control, environmentally rapacious financial elite, and eco-cops defending a scorched Amazon, the film lays stark evidence before us. In the past, we could use up a regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resources and move on. But if todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s global civilization collapses from over-consumption, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it. We have no back-up planet.\n\nSurviving Progress brings us thinkers who have probed our primate past, our brains, and our societies. Some amplify WrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s urgent warning, while others have faith that the very progress which has put us in jeopardy is also the key to our salvation. Cosmologist Stephen Hawking looks to homes on other planets. Biologist Craig Venter, whose team decoded the human genome, designs synthetic organisms he hopes will create artificial food and fuel for all.\n\nDistinguished Professor of Environment Vaclav Smil counters that five billion Ã¢â‚¬Å“have-notsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ aspire to our affluent lifestyle and, without limits on the energy and resource-consumption of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“havesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, we face certain catastrophe. Others Ã¢â‚¬â€ including primatologist Jane Goodall, author Margaret Atwood, and activists from the Congo, Canada, and USA Ã¢â‚¬â€ place their hope in our ingenuity and moral evolution.\n\nSurviving Progress leaves us with a challenge: To prove that making apes smarter was not an evolutionary dead-end.\n\n\n\nSurviving Progress homepage: http://survivingprogress.com/\nBBC Surviving Progress homepage: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jrlsf\n\nTrailer:\n\n\n----\nFile|\n----\n\nMovie (AVI) Name ..: BBC Surviving Progress 2012.avi\nTotal Size Bytes ..: 735,219,998 Bytes\nLength.............: 1:22:08\nType...............: AVI(.AVI)\n\n-----\nVideo|\n-----\n\nCodec Code ........: XVID\nCodec Name ........: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nBitrate ...........: 1065\nResolution ........: 624 x 352\nAspect Ratio ......: 1.773\nFramerate .........: 25.000\n\n-----\nAudio|\n-----\n\nCodec Code ........:\nCodec Name ........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nBitrate ...........: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ..........: 2\nSampling Rate .....: 48000 Hz \n\nA short sample is included for evaluation.\n\n*** Thanks to [b]amdxer[/b]@Demonoid for the cap and upload *** \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d879955462bdb2645cee6b710bd3237106b97c02","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Surviving+Progress+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d879955462bdb2645cee6b710bd3237106b97c02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,121,149,84,98,189,178,100,92,238,107,113,11,211,35,113,6,185,124,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
