The contents of this torrent are two special edition Masterworks archival collections from Minutemen scanners - one self-titled, and one of the London series - and two single issues - Prelude (by Qweth'l-DCP) and Aftermath (also by Minutemen). These are some great scans of these B&amp;W comics with some great painted art in most of it, so they might be worth checking even if they are not your bag. All thanks and credit to the original scanners, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e17c27917192f19440193f656622a284cd27f23","amp;dn":"Night+of+the+Living+Dead+FantaCo+Collection+%281991-1994%7CMM%2BDCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e17c27917192f19440193f656622a284cd27f23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,23,194,121,23,25,47,25,68,1,147,246,86,98,42,40,76,210,127,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
