Intelligence specialists have discovered elements of the Iraqi insurgency may be demonically possessed. No one in the intelligence agencies is qualified to handle this problem, and that means a private contractor must be employed. Databases identify only one potential candidate: John Constantine. Constantine is taken from the comfort of his London home to the brutal climates of Iraq due to military coercion, but also because of his interest in a mysterious, beautiful Iraqi agent whose true allegiances are kept in shadow.\n\nBY JAMIE DELANO AND JOCK\n\nPUBLISHED BY DC,VERTIGO IMPRINT\n\n134 pages | 107MB\n\nENJOY AND SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0a5bc250bfdd817f82d6928ec536004c308d20b","amp;dn":"JOHN+CONSTANTINE%2CHELLBLAZER+-+PANDEMONIUM+HC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0a5bc250bfdd817f82d6928ec536004c308d20b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,165,188,37,11,253,216,23,248,45,105,40,236,83,96,4,195,8,210,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
