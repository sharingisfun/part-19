Only gorgeous, unavailable Anton Grey gives Rebecca the time of day, but she wonders if he's got a hidden agenda.\nThen one night, among the oak trees in Lafayette Cemetery, Rebecca makes a friend. Sweet, mysterious Lisette is eager to show Rebecca the nooks and crannies of New Orleans. There's just one catch.\nLisette is a ghost.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:203ff5cf0603665fadd63c657de7ba7b426ca2de","amp;dn":"Ruined+-+A+Novel+%28Ruined+%231%29+-+Paula+Morris+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"203ff5cf0603665fadd63c657de7ba7b426ca2de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,63,245,207,6,3,102,95,173,214,60,101,125,231,186,123,66,108,162,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
