An increasing number of foods fortified with novel amounts and combinations of nutrients are being introduced into the food supplies of countries around the world to raise populations' nutrient intakes. It is a technology that is becoming more widely used to tackle a variety of public health problems such as micronutrient malnutrition.\r\n\r\nFood fortification policies and programs are controversial. There are disputes over the ethics of food fortification as everyone who consumes fortified foods will be exposed to raised levels of nutrients irrespective of whether they will gain any benefit and often without their knowledge. There are also contested views about the evidence that is available to support such activities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c879434130bcd203c375ec568c07459c496f788b","amp;dn":"Food+Fortification%3A+The+evidence%2C+ethics%2C+and+politics+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c879434130bcd203c375ec568c07459c496f788b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,121,67,65,48,188,210,3,195,117,236,86,140,7,69,156,73,111,120,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
