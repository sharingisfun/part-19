That's 20 long years ago.  Memories. Some  vivid, most just a blur. \nThe one constant thing has been focus and desire. \nThe same vision they had in '89 is still burning strong. \nFuelled by the down-tuned sludge of the Melvins, and the aggression of Peter Steele's Carnivore, They created a beast and Crowbar was born. \nThe band's sound was labelled DOOM-CORE by the Euro press shortly after the 1992 debut release 'Obedience thru Suffering'. \n\n\nCrowbar have released 7 full-length CDs, the second selling over 100,000 copies worldwide. \nThey threw in a live EP and a few best-of compilations for good measure and are now ready to unleash 'Lifesblood for the Downtrodden' in early 2005. \nAnyone who knows Crowbar is familiar with the numerous label and line-up changes over the years. \n A solid new line-up for this re-birth of sorts. They recruited Rex Brown (Pantera, Down), Craig Nunenmacher (Black Label Society, CROWBAR) and Warren Riker (DOWN II) for the recording and producing of this monster, and All are  very pleased with the outcome. \nThese 11 tracks show an equally dangerous, more mature Crowbar. One part aggression, one part melodic, all parts Heavy!! \nThis is a natural growth for a band that didn't know the fret board went above 5 frets back in '89. \nA natural growth in the song writing and vocal style. \n\nA step forward - period. \nAfter a two-and-a-half-year hiatus they recorded and toured with DOWN, Crowbar hit the stage for the first time on June,24th. 2004 in the Netherlands. \nThis was the first show since October 2001. \n\nThe new line-up Kirk Windstein (vocals/guitar), Steve Gibb (guitar), Tommy Buckley (drums), and Pat Bruders (bass) proved to be crushing from the first few chords. \nTheir two week European tour was a big success with the highlight being a storming set at the withe Force fest in Leipzig, Germany. \nWith the release of the new CD fast approaching, they were ready to hit the road and lay down the law wherever they play. \nThe old dog might be getting older, but just might hang around another 20 years!!\n\n\nCurrent members:\n \n1989-   Kirk Windstein - vocals, guitars, bass\n2005-   Tommy Buckley - drums\n2005-   Patrick Bruders - bass\n2009-   Matthew Brunson - guitar\n\nFormer musicians:\n\n1989   Mike Savoie - bass\n1989-1990   Jimmy Bower - drums\nÃ¢â‚¬Âº 1996-1998   -//-\n1989-1990   Kevin Noonan - guitar\nÃ¢â‚¬Âº 1991-1993   -//-\n1989-2000   Todd Strange - bass\n1991   Travis - guitar\n1991-1995   Craig Nunenmacher - drums\nÃ¢â‚¬Âº 2000   -//-\nÃ¢â‚¬Âº 2004-2005   -//-\n1993-1997   Matt Thomas - guitar\n1998-2002   Sammy Duet - guitar\n2000   Sid Montz - drums\n2000   Jeremy Young - bass\n2001   Tony Costanza - drums\n2001   Jeff &quot;Okie&quot; Okoneski - bass\n2004-2009   Steve Gibb - guitar, vocals\n \n\n\nDiscography:\n\n1991 - Obedience Thru Suffering\n1993 - Crowbar\n1995 - Time Heals Nothing (2008 Remastered)\n1996 - Broken Glass\n1998 - Odd Fellows Rest\n2000 - Equilibrium\n2001 - Sonic Excess In Its Purest Form\n2005 - Lifesblood For The Downtrodden\n2011 - Sever The Wicked Hand\n2014 - Symmetry In Black (Not Included)\n\nAll in CBR@320k\n\nGenre:\tDoom\n\nSubgenre:\tSludge / Doom\n\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t1.01 GB\n\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n112 files\n\n\nNow, if you like the music go to the shows and buy the merch,Want the CD buy it from the bands webpage (NOT wal-mart) that money goes to the artists not to anyone else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39744074d6ff581840c7d2d06d25a3ef049bc8cc","amp;dn":"Crowbar.-.Discography.+.+1991-+2011++320k++mp3++ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39744074d6ff581840c7d2d06d25a3ef049bc8cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,116,64,116,214,255,88,24,64,199,210,208,109,37,163,239,4,155,200,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
