So me and my friends were buying LP's, mostly form UK, by post. It was not so easy as it is today Anyhow, we had a system: everyone of us was buying a different album (the artist could be the same, but the title not), cause our budget was low. We were then making copies on audiotapes, so we could listen at home to more different good music. One day a friend showed up with magazine and he said: guys we have to buy this! We aksed: buy what? And he showed us a very good cover with a bended tube on it. Who the hell is this guy? was the obvious question. Well, he said, Mike Odlfield! Mike who? What kind of music it is? He didn' have a clue, (neither of us did), but he said: the cover is great, so the music is too! I am sure! Three weeks later we got the record...and the rest is history! We were stoned by his music! It was 1982 and I was 15 (it happens when you have a jazzer father and a rocker mother and a couple of 2 to 3 years older friends ) Few years later I bought this cd for me, it was '86 or '87, so it is older than I was when I bought it...Oh, yes, you guessed right, it is Tubular Bells, on e of my favourite albums ever...\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
