Interviews with filmmakers, key designers, builders, stunt drivers, actors and fans of the Batmobile lead the viewer on an exploration of the true impact of this cultural icon.  Personal stories will interweave with historical context to tell the definitive story of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most recognized automobile.
