Of the musicians who would be part of the band dubbed Rare Earth, only sax player Gil Bridges and drummer Pete Rivera were present. John Parrish joined on bass in 1962. Rod Richards became a guitarist with the group in 1966. Keyboardist Kenny James came into the fold the same year. After years of doing the club circuit, the group changed their name to Rare Earth and released Dreams/Answers on Verve. The album received little reaction and the group was picked up by Motown Records as the first act on their yet-to-be-named new label. Rare Earth suggested to Motown that the label name their new subsidiary after the band and Rare Earth Records was born.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Get Ready\n02.I Just Want To Celebrate\n03.(I Know) I'm Losing You\n04.Born To Wander\n05.Hey Big Brother\n06.What'd I Say\n07.Ma\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10ceffe7a47ca8244931d94b2699dfbba0735249","amp;dn":"Rare+Earth+-+20th+Century+Masters++Best+Of+%282001%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10ceffe7a47ca8244931d94b2699dfbba0735249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,206,255,231,164,124,168,36,73,49,217,75,38,153,223,187,160,115,82,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
