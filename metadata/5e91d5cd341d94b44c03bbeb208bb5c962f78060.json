There is no need to download everything that is in a .torrent.\n\nRequest: initial seeding, the first upload of 5.6 GB takes the longest; to upload it as quickly as possible, please do not limit your upload or keep pausing this torrent, it could double the time of upload. If you do not want to help with seeding, then please wait until there are more than few seeders and then do as you please. When you start and stop a torrent, it takes more time and recourses to finish the initial upload. \n\nNote: Original DVDs are DVD-9 (Dual-Layer of 5.6 to 7.3 GB each). In some counties, it is not so easy to make a DVD from these vob files. We have tried using Ã¢â‚¬Å“DVDFab Platinum 7.0.7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ To reduce DVD-9 to DVD-5, from 7.3 GB down to 4.3 GB, but avi rip came out better Quality. The original disk has too much red color in it and rip helped just a bit.\n\nWe could share the VOB files if there will be enough request for them. For now we are sharing 5 DVD Audio and Rips in one torrent. We tried to make video and mp3 files as small as we could without losing too much quality.\n\nDVD sound tracks where split in accordance to DVD chapters and the sound volume was adjusted, especially of the questions, which was very low in some of the recordings.\n\n________________________\n\nThere are still a few videos we do not have in torrents so we are taking up a collection to Buy as a Group and share them via torrents.\n\nHere is the remaining list of the ones we would like to buy and in this order:\nVideo #12: The Paranormal\nThe Law of Attraction - Short Video Collection\nVideo #08: Death &amp; Life\n________________________\n\nIn response to this Group-Buy Project request for torrents of videos that others already have, the following torrents have been created:\n\nAbraham-Hicks Video #13 Disaster and Destruction DVD (vob)\nAbraham-Hicks Video #13 Disaster and Destruction DVD Rip+mp3\nAbraham-Hicks 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM VHS to DVD (Part-1 of 5)\nAbraham-Hicks 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM VHS to DVD (Part-2 of 5) (Reload)\nAbraham-Hicks 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM VHS to DVD (Part-3 of 5)\nAbraham-Hicks 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM VHS to DVD (Part-4 of 5)\nAbraham-Hicks 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM VHS to DVD (Part-5 of 5)\nAbraham-Hicks 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM DVDRip+MP3 from 5 VHSs\nAbraham-Hicks AV-7 PARENTING 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM VHS to DVD\nAbraham-Hicks 1993 AV-7 PARENTING VHS to DVDRip+MP3s\nAbraham-Hicks 2006-09-17 Alaskan Cruise 13 Tapes\nAbraham-Hicks Astonishing Power of Emotions DVD (vob)\nAbraham-Hicks Astonishing Power of Emotions DVDRp+mp3\nAbraham-Hicks Revised Health &amp; Well-Being Final DVD (vob)\nAbraham-Hicks Revised Health &amp; Well-Being Final DVD Rip+MP3\n\nThe following have been purchased from the Group-Buy Project funds and are now available in torrents:\n\nAbraham-Hicks 2008 Abraham Abroad [2 DVDs - VOB]\nAbraham-Hicks 2008 Abraham Abroad 2 DVDRips+MP3s\n\n\nYou can stay updated on the progress of the Group-Buy Project at this URL address:\n\nNote: We will be buying and sharing the material as the money comes in.
