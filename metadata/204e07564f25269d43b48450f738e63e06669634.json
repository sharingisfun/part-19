The opening 'Moon Child,' with its attractively spacy vocals, is reminiscent of the days of 'The Creator Has a Master Plan,' but this version sounds too contrived to rival the classic earlier recording. The mood is subdued throughout and the choice of tunes definitely on the conservative side ( 'All or Nothing at All' and 'The Night Has a Thousand Eyes,' among the six tracks ). William Henderson is lovely on piano, while the drummer ( Eddie Moore ) and percussionist ( Cheikh Tidiane Fale ) keep to the quiet side. The results may have originally disappointed some of Sanders' fans, but with time the saxophonist clearly reinvented himself as a more traditional improviser capable of thoughtful and pensive deliberations. ~ Steven Loewy, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nPharoah Sanders ( Soprano and Tenor Saxophone, Vocals ) \nWilliam Henderson ( Piano ) \nStafford James ( Double Bass ) \nEddie Moore ( Drums ) \nCheikh Tidiane Fale ( Percussion )\n\nPharoah Sanders - Moon Child Tracks:\n01  Moon Child ( Pharoah Sanders ) 8:07 \n02  Moon Rays ( Horace Silver ) 6:10 \n03  The Night Has A Thousand Eyes ( Buddy Bermien/Jerry Brainin ) 12:17 \n04  All Or Nothing At All ( Arthur Altman/Jack Lawrence ) 9:23 \n05  Soon ( George Gerschwin ) 5:29 \n06  Moniebah ( Abdullah Ibrahim [Dollar Brand] ) 10:43","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:204e07564f25269d43b48450f738e63e06669634","amp;dn":"Pharoah+Sanders+-+Moon+Child+%281990%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"204e07564f25269d43b48450f738e63e06669634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,78,7,86,79,37,38,157,67,180,132,80,247,56,230,62,6,102,150,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
