They may take one person, a couple or an entire family. They have no racial or social preference; they have abducted people from all walks of life to mysterious bright rooms where they conduct unusual procedures. The phenomenon has come to be called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alien AbductionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in pop-cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€where entities claiming to be from distant star systems whisk people away into bizarre and unwanted test beds.\n\nNow, for the first time, it is revealed through analytical duplication what for the past two decades a team known as the CE4 Research Group has discovered using guidelines for redundancy similar to methods employed by scientists and investigators to illustrate repeatability and thus Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause-and-effect.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHaving documented more than 300 actual test cases, Ã¢â‚¬Å“experiencersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (as they are called in abduction communities) have witnessed their abuse permanently stopped due to this research. In essence, they have been Ã¢â‚¬Å“curedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of an unknown malady through what most in the public will find to be shocking, disturbing or a confirmation of faithÃ¢â‚¬â€the power of Jesus name.\n\nUnholy Communion: The Alien Abduction Phenomenon, Where It Originates Ã¢â‚¬â€œ And How It Stops is without precedent. This first ever, systematic approach provides compelling evidence through repeat verification that a connection between so-called alien-abduction, the supernatural and deliverance through Jesus Christ as savior exists.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid Ruffino has researched UFOs and abduction for over 45 years. He's an alien abduction counselor, an ordained minister and has spoken in Roswell and on radio shows. \n\nJoe Jordan is a 16 year Field Investigator for the Mutual UFO Network, president of CE4 Research Group","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:497f0c089c0340ac3dcc449f8b2cd1d147cf937a","amp;dn":"Unholy+Communion+-+Joseph+Jordan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"497f0c089c0340ac3dcc449f8b2cd1d147cf937a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,127,12,8,156,3,64,172,61,204,68,159,139,44,209,209,71,207,147,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
