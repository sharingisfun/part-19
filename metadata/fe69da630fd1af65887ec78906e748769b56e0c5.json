Over a forty-year career he released twenty studio albums, working with artists such as Eric Clapton and David Gilmour. He has been described by The Times as &quot;an electrifying guitarist and singer whose music blurred the boundaries between folk, jazz, rock and blues&quot;.(Wikipedia)\n\nLondon Conversation is the first album by John Martyn released on Island Records in 1967.
