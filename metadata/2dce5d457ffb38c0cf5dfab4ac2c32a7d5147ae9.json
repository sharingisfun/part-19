He works through 7 songs of synth pop rock with ease. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got a good voice to add to the overall package and a solid backing band who handles the percussion steadilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.As in most cases when a Saxophone is present on these vinyl new wavers, it adds a nice touch throughout \n\n\nA1 I Dream   4:04 \nA2 Summer   3:56 \nA3 The Haunting Moon   3:33 \nA4 Push! Pound!   2:34 \nB5 As Winter Falls   4:06 \nB6 Please Don't...   3:53 \nB7 The Change   3:38 \n\n\nRAF - The Heat's On [1981]\n\nVery nice UK 80's band. Well crafted songs by singer and keyboard player David Valentine. RAF stands for , Rich and Famous. This dream never came true. \n\n1 Easy Come Is Easy Go    \n2 Borrowed Time    \n3 Talking Pictures    \n4 Miracles    \n5 Holocaust    \n6 Miracles (Reprise)    \n7 I Can't Get Started    \n8 You Can't Hold Back Now    \n9 Stop Her on Sight    \n10 The Heat's On    \n11 Tightrope    \n \n\nShort Romans - Short Romans [1987]\n\nExcellent LP from this talented German band. Consisted of Dirk Draeger, Heinz Weber and Mef Komorek. If you like Comsat Angels, then this will be your kind of music.\n\nA1 Radio   5:05 \nA2 White Sails   4:10 \nA3 Invade Your Star   3:40 \nA4 Let the Fires Burn   4:53 \nA5 Linda   4:38 \nB1 So Far Away   3:36 \nB2 What Makes the World Go Round   3:34 \nB3 Jealous Way   3:46 \nB4 You Were on My Mind   3:22 \nB5 Eclipse of the Moon   3:55 \nB6 It's Got Me   3:33 \n\n\nThe Contractions - Something Broke [1984]\n\nAn all girls triplet band consisted of Debbie Hopkins, Kathy Peck and Mary Kelley. Even their producer was a girl too. They made an attempt to ride the new wave bandwagon with this record, but as you know the rest is history. They remained obscure and without a contract.\n\nA1 Voices Do Repeat   4:32 \nA2 No Matter   2:43 \nA3 Life and Death   3:17 \nA4 Early Warning   3:45 \nA5 Rank and Vile   3:16 \nB1 Waiting Game   3:40 \nB2 Vampyre's Song   3:25 \nB3 Death of Romance   2:37 \nB4 Bewitching Me   3:44 \nB5 Fifteen   4:47 \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dce5d457ffb38c0cf5dfab4ac2c32a7d5147ae9","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+115%5D+New+Romantic%2C+Post-Punk%2C+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dce5d457ffb38c0cf5dfab4ac2c32a7d5147ae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,206,93,69,127,251,56,192,207,93,250,180,172,44,50,167,213,20,122,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
