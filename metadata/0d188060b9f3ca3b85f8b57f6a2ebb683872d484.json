CNN, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other media outlets air special reports and name call anyone who questions the government as conspiracy theorists in an effort to suppress information.  Yet, with the de-classification of decades-old documents, it can be found that many of these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œconspiracy theoriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are not so theoretical after all.\n\nWe'll visit a real-life FEMA camp that will send tingles up your treason-bones.
