It was reissued on CD in 1992.\n\nAfter Bluegrass Evolution, Ricky Skaggs replaced Larry Rice and Jerry Douglas joined the group for this eponymously titled album, more commonly known by its Rounder Records catalogue number (&quot;Rounder 0044&quot;). Stylisticly, this album marked a sharp turn from Bluegrass Evolution as the majority of the album traditional bluegrass instrumentation on songs by up-and-coming singer-songwriters such as Gordon Lightfoot, Utah Phillips and Rodney Crowell, as well as incorporating traditional songs. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Crowe_%26_The_New_South&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Crowe_%26_The_New_South&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b0b674f362dc92c64bb0b40d1838e8653d2ab1","amp;dn":"J.D.+Crowe+and+the+New+South+%281975%29+MP3+320kbps+%28WCS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b0b674f362dc92c64bb0b40d1838e8653d2ab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,176,182,116,243,98,220,146,198,75,176,180,13,24,56,232,101,61,42,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
