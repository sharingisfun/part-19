This is the award-winning game that helped define the FPS genre and introduced unparalleled interactivity and a talking main character. \n\nTake the fight to the aliens in Hollywood, Los Angeles, a moon base and alien spacecraft. Defeat the aliens, so Duke can get back to some R&amp;R with a stogie, a warm belly and a bottle of Jack.\n\nDuke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition is the DRM-Free version of this legendary shooter. It includes the fourth bonus episode, a new weapon, and enemies. On top of that, we give you over a 100 free Duke Nukem 3D ringtones, as an extra bonus!\n\nDownload Fan-Made Mods!
