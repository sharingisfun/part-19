Weighted about three to one in favor of Charles' own compositions, its raison d'etre was the hits &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot; and the pounding, soaring &quot;Ain't That Love,&quot; which opens the LP. As with other Atlantic albums of the period, its content was determined more by Charles' recent singles than by a real plan for the LP, but even within those limitations it's an amazingly subtle record. Charles does just as well with his interpretations of others' work, most notably the ominous, gospel-focused rendition of &quot;Sinner's Prayer&quot; (which offers a virtuoso piano performance, and comes courtesy of the pen of Charles' former mentor Lowell Fulson) and Henry Glover's wrenching ballad &quot;Drown in My Own Tears,&quot; which is topped out on each verse by a gorgeous chorus. &quot;Funny (But I Still Love You)&quot; offers a guitar break played in such an understated fashion that it almost doesn't seem so much a part of R&amp;B as it was usually being offered in 1957 as it does a part of Charles' early career output. The second side of the LP is even better, opening with the title track, a number that is almost too ubiquitous in its various cover versions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the original has a mix of urgency and playfulness that's absolutely bracing, and the album carries this mood forward with &quot;Mess Around,&quot; an Ahmet Ertegun-authored piano- and sax-driven romp with Charles at his most ebullient as a singer. &quot;This Little Girl of Mine&quot; offers him in a surprisingly light, almost acrobatic vocal mode, while &quot;Greenbacks&quot; is a knowing, clever cautionary narrative that is almost a throwback to 1940s-style R&amp;B. &quot;Don't You Know&quot; is as salacious a piece of R&amp;B as one was likely to hear in 1957, and &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; closes the record out on a pounding, driving note.\n \nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Ray Charles except as indicated.\n \nSide A\nAin't That Love 2:51\nDrown in My Own Tears (Henry Glover) 3:21\nCome Back Baby 3:06\nSinner's Prayer (Lloyd Glenn, Lowell Fulson) 3:24\nFunny (But I Still Love You) 3:15\nLosing Hand (Charles E.

What you get is a clear and flat transfer. For getting a clear sound, I'll do an extended washing of each record with my RCM, which can take up to 30 minutes brushing on each side. Resistant ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is not to lose any musical information in the process. Surface noises, as long they are not too high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings or on records recorded at extremely low levels do I use a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, &quot;Life is full of surface noises.&quot; In some cases this means that I have to make a compromise.... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria, which is IMO quite high.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a63e3ee6e9f23a2d5f01e85af4eae957ec3a381","amp;dn":"Ray+Charles+-+Ray+Charles+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BVinyl+-+Mono%5D-akman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a63e3ee6e9f23a2d5f01e85af4eae957ec3a381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,99,227,238,110,159,35,162,213,240,30,133,175,78,174,149,126,195,163,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
