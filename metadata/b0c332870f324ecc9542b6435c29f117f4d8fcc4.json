Most of the tracks are fairly generic, although if you're into the car-song genre, then this disc is a treasure trove. Highlights include a pair of barroom saxophone instrumentals #&quot;Cruisin',&quot; &quot;When Johnny Comes Slidin' Home&quot;) by the Hollywood Vines and Sharon Marie's brisk run-through of the Gershwin chestnut &quot;Summertime,&quot; which clocks in at well under two minutes in length. Also included is one of Brian Wilson's most elaborate early productions, &quot;Guess I'm Dumb,&quot; sung by Glen Campbell.
