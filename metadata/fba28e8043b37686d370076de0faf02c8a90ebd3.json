His 2006 release, Ghost Repeater garnered praise from publications such as The New Yorker, No Depression, MOJO, The Chicago-Sun Times, and The Irish Times. Jeffrey's repertoire is pure Americana poetry, a mix of country blues, country, and folk music that the Boston Globe noted for its &quot;rolling, reflective ballads [that] shimmer with blue shade, everyday images, and the quiet strength of hard-earned wisdom.&quot;\n\n001    \tCross of the Flowers\n002    \tMayfly\n003    \tDouble Tree\n004    \tStripping Cane\n005    \tThe Bluest Blade\n006    \tPearl Handled Pistol\n007    \tNorthbound 35\n008    \t4 &amp; 20 Blues\n009    \tDon't Look For Me\n010    \tTropic of Cancer\n011    \tLodi\n012    \tEvery New Leaf Over\n\n\nJeffrey is a truly gifted song writer and performer.
