Released during the hiatus of the group *NSYNC, the album signaled Timberlake's desire to craft a more mature image than that of a &quot;boy band member&quot;. The album features guest performances by Timbaland, Clipse, Bubba Sparxxx, and Janet Jackson. The final song, &quot;Never Again&quot;, featured Brian McKnight on nearly all of the instruments. Justified was honored with two Grammy Awards at the 2004 Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The album was also nominated at the event for Album of the Year. The album has sold more than seven million copies worldwide\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Senorita\t\t\t\t- Featuring Pharrell Williams\n[02] Like I Love You\t\t\t- Featuring Clipse\n[03] (Oh No) What You Got   \t\t- Justin Timberlake &amp; Timbaland\n[04] Take It From Here\t\t\t- Featuring Pharrell Williams\n[05] Cry Me A River\t\t\t- Justin Timberlake &amp; Timbaland\n[06] Rock Your Body\t\t\t- Featuring Pharrell Williams\n[07] Nothin' Else\t\t\t\t- Featuring Pharrell Williams\n[08] Last Night\t\t\t\t\n[09] Still On My Brain\t\t\t\n[10] (And She Said) Take Me Now\t\t- Featuring Janet Jackson\n[11] Right For Me\t\t\t\t- Featuring Bubba Sparxxx\n[12] Let's Take A Ride\t\t\t- Featuring Pharrell Williams\n[13] Never Again\t\t\t\t- Featuring Brian McKnight\n\n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time\t- 01h:03m:15s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 153 mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320 khps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- R&amp;B Pop\n\nOriginally Release\t\t- 05 November 2002\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Jive Zomba Recordings\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.justintimberlake.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4363ac32214d337c67ece4bcd0801450483f9ce7","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+Justified+-+Justin+Timberlake+-+153mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4363ac32214d337c67ece4bcd0801450483f9ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,99,172,50,33,77,51,124,103,236,228,188,208,128,20,80,72,63,156,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
