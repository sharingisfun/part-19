These 'Streamline' edits run shorter because they are\nmissing teasers, cartoons, flashbacks, repetition, history lessons, fun facts,\n&quot;we're experts&quot;, and anything else that slows down the show.\n\nThis is Mythbusters, the way it's meant to be seen.\n\nIf you are wondering why the video quality varies it is because many different\npeople are making these edits over a long period of time. They have similar\nstyles of editing but there are differences in how they edit and what programs\nand source material they use.\n\nJoin us at /r/smyths/ .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ac9ad5b8289d1042d445f6989ecff708aabaa2c","amp;dn":"Streamlined+Mythbusters+Complete+2014-08-26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ac9ad5b8289d1042d445f6989ecff708aabaa2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,201,173,91,130,137,209,4,45,68,95,105,137,236,255,112,138,171,170,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
