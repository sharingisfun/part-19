Seemingly contradictory emotions come through in her feelings on falling in love on &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; (&quot;You've already won me over in spite of me.../I couldn't help it/It's all your fault&quot;). JAGGED LITTLE PILL is modern and aware music from a daring young songwriter.\n\n1 All I Really Want\n\n2 You Oughta Know\n\n3 Perfect\n\n4 Hand in My Pocket\n\n5 Right Through You\n\n6 Forgiven\n\n7 You Learn\n\n8 Head Over Feet\n\n9 Mary Jane\n\n10 Ironic\n\n11 Not The Doctor\n\n12 Wake Up\n\n13 You Oughta Know","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17bae8185db33465b3f13bbe1d5802656e6b9a68","amp;dn":"Alanis+Morisette-Jagged-Little-Pill%5BFlac%5D-Winker%40Kidzcorner-1337","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17bae8185db33465b3f13bbe1d5802656e6b9a68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,186,232,24,93,179,52,101,179,241,59,190,29,88,2,101,110,107,154,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
