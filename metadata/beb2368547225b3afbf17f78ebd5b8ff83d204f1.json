He was known primarily for playing in the bebop, hard bop and post-bop styles from the early 1960s and on. His unmistakable and influential tone contributed to new perspectives for modern jazz and bebop.\n\nTrumpeter Freddie Hubbard really came into his own during this Blue Note session. He is matched with quite an all-star group (tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Art Davis, and drummer Elvin Jones in addition to Bernard McKinney on euphonium), introduces two of his finest compositions (&quot;Birdlike&quot; and &quot;Crisis&quot;), and is quite lyrical on his ballad feature, &quot;Weaver of Dreams.&quot; Hubbard's sidemen all play up to par and this memorable session is highly recommended; it's one of the trumpeter's most rewarding Blue Note albums.\n\nTracklist:\n1 - &quot;Arietis&quot; - 6:41\n2 - &quot;Weaver of Dreams&quot; - 6:35\n3 - &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; - 6:38\n4 - &quot;Birdlike&quot; - 10:15\n5 - &quot;Crisis&quot; - 11:33\n\nMusicians:\nFreddie Hubbard (trumpet)\nBernard McKinney (euphonium)\nWayne Shorter (tenor saxophone)\nMcCoy Tyner (piano)\nArt Davis (bass)\nElvin Jones (drums)\n\nRecorded August 21, 1961 in Rudy Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, NJ\nProduced by Alfred Lion\n\nOriginally released as Blue Note BLP 4085 (mono) and BST 84085 (stereo)\n\nHDtracks PCM-24Bit-192Khz-FLAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beb2368547225b3afbf17f78ebd5b8ff83d204f1","amp;dn":"Freddie+Hubbard+-+Ready+For+Freddie+%281961%29+2013+HDTracks+24-192-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beb2368547225b3afbf17f78ebd5b8ff83d204f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,178,54,133,71,34,91,58,251,241,127,120,235,213,184,255,131,210,4,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
