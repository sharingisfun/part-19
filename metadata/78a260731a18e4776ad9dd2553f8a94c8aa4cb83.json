Kaliski (Editor)\nFormat:PDF\nPublisher: MacMillan Reference Books (January 2001)\nLanguage: English\n\nCovering accounting, management, marketing, law, finance, and economics, this set aims &quot;to summarize the body of knowledge that we know as business in a single place and in language accessible to the layperson.&quot; Special emphasis is placed on careers and ethics in various areas of business, such as &quot;Careers in Finance&quot; and &quot;Ethics in Finance.&quot; The 300-plus alphabetically arranged entries do more than simply define a term; for example, the entry for accounting also describes its history, principles, and agencies, shows how students can enter the profession, and provides cross references to related topics such as &quot;Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.&quot; All the entries are in fact cross-referenced and include bibliographies offering print resources and web sites. In addition to business terms, legislation such as &quot;Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977&quot; and agencies, including the &quot;General Accounting Office,&quot; have featured entries. An alphabetical index is included, with numbers in bold face indicating main entries. Many of the entries are illustrated with photographs, tables, and figures. Designed for a wide audience ranging from high school students to lay readers to practitioners, this work is highly recommended for school, academic, and public libraries.
