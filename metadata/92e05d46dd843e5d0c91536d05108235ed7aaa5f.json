In the movie, van Rijn has just moved to Amsterdam and, following the death of his wife, takes to riotous living with easy women and too much drink, spending himself into penury. The filmmakers have taken great care to ensure that what is seen on the screen resembles the lively paintings of the Great Master himself.
