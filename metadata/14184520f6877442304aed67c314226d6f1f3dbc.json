During these presentations the enthusiasm of the attendees elicited from Abraham a flow of ideas which have become central to their teachings. The power of the questions and the clarity of the answers make this distillation of those seminars uniquely historic.\n\nJoin Esther and Jerry on their only journey &quot;across the pond&quot; and share the best from five unprecedented workshops, during which Abraham's Vortex concept was born.
