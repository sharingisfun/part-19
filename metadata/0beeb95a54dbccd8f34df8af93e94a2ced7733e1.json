He soon realizes that these - along with the clinically pre-occupied townspeople, secret societies, and peculiar sounds from the forest - are intimately connected to the core mystery. And what's with the gnomes?\r\nCreated with indie comic artist Graham Annable's unique narrative and visual sensibilities, delivered with the distinctive Telltale storytelling style, Puzzle Agent is sure to challenge, thrill and engage in more ways than you can shake a cryptogram at!\r\nPlentiful puzzles to challenge your neurons. See if you can find every puzzle to solve the mystery of Scoggins -- mazes, logic, riddles, brainteasers and more.\r\nInvestigate the strange, peculiar and mind-boggling to crack the case! Your discoveries provide clues to the larger mystery crippling the town, or uncover puzzles that must be solved to reveal answers ... or even more questions.\r\nHunting for Hints: Chewing gum helps Agent Tethers think and solve. Find and collect gum wads around the town to uncover hints if you get &quot;stuck&quot; in any puzzles.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP / Vista / Windows 7\r\nProcessor: 2.0 GHz +\r\nMemory: 512MB\r\nGraphics: 64MB DirectX 8.1-compliant video card\r\nDirectXÂ®: DirectX 8.1 or greater\r\nHard Drive: 220MB\r\nSound: DirectX 8.1 or greater sound device\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: XP / Vista / Windows 7\r\nProcessor: 3 GHz Pentium 4 or greater\r\nMemory: 1GB\r\nGraphics: 128MB DirectX 8.1-compliant video card\r\nDirectXÂ®: DirectX 8.1 or greater\r\nHard Drive: 220MB\r\nSound: DirectX 8.1 or greater sound device","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0beeb95a54dbccd8f34df8af93e94a2ced7733e1","amp;dn":"Puzzle+Agent+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0beeb95a54dbccd8f34df8af93e94a2ced7733e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,238,185,90,84,219,204,216,243,77,248,175,147,233,74,44,237,119,51,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
