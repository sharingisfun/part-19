She documents how the low-fat nutrition advice of the past sixty years has amounted to a vast uncontrolled experiment on the entire population, with disastrous consequences for our health.\n\nFor decades, we have been told that the best possible diet involves cutting back on fat, especially saturated fat, and that if we are not getting healthier or thinner it must be because we are not trying hard enough. But what if the low-fat diet is itself the problem? What if the very foods weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been denying ourselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€the creamy cheeses, the sizzling steaksÃ¢â‚¬â€are themselves the key to reversing the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease?\n\nIn this captivating, vibrant, and convincing narrative, based on a nine-year-long investigation, Teicholz shows how the misinformation about saturated fats took hold in the scientific community and the public imagination, and how recent findings have overturned these beliefs. She explains why the Mediterranean Diet is not the healthiest, and how we might be replacing trans fats with something even worse. This startling history demonstrates how nutrition science has gotten it so wrong: how overzealous researchers, through a combination of ego, bias, and premature institutional consensus, have allowed dangerous misrepresentations to become dietary dogma.\n\nWith eye-opening scientific rigor, The Big Fat Surprise upends the conventional wisdom about all fats with the groundbreaking claim that more, not less, dietary fatÃ¢â‚¬â€including saturated fatÃ¢â‚¬â€is what leads to better health and wellness. Science shows that we have been needlessly avoiding meat, cheese, whole milk, and eggs for decades and that we can now, guilt-free, welcome these delicious foods back into our lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e3c0993f8b7a4a647cfc0080869fba6c3cbdd1","amp;dn":"The+Big+Fat+Surprise+-+Why+Butter%2C+Meat+Belong+in+a+Healthy+Diet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e3c0993f8b7a4a647cfc0080869fba6c3cbdd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,227,192,153,63,139,122,74,100,124,252,0,128,134,159,186,108,60,189,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
