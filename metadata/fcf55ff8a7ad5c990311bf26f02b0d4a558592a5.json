I feel he's there in my living room&quot;. \n\nThis viewer's reaction to Geoff Hamilton's sudden death in 1996 sums up the impact the charismatic TV gardener had on many BBC 2 Gardeners' World devotees. From the moment he appeared on our screens to the time he was laid to rest in his jeans and boots, Geoff Hamilton was the UK's domestic gardening authority; the one to whom people turned week after week for down-to-earth, practical advice on what was going on in their own back yards.\n\nSubtitled &quot;A Portrait of Britain's Best-Loved Gardener&quot;, this five-part 1999 documentary tribute is a must for anyone who regularly switched to BBC2 on Friday nights. From his early life through marriage, fatherhood, divorce and new-found happiness, this is the story of how an ordinary man communicated his passion for gardening to millions every week.\n\nWith contributions from Geoff's family and many friends, the series succeeds in drawing a warm, loving portrait of a man sorely missed...not only by those who knew him, but by a nation. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Hamilton&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGeneral / Container Stream #1\n\tVideo Codecs Used.................................XviD\n\tAudio Codecs Used.................................MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n\tFile Format.......................................AVI\n\tTotal Stream BitRate..............................1,739 Kbps\nVideo Stream #1\n\tCodec (Human Name)................................MPEG-4 Visual\n\tCodec (FourCC)....................................XVID\n\tFrame Width.......................................640 pixels\n\tFrame Height......................................480 pixels\n\tFrame Rate........................................25.000 fps\n\tDisplay Aspect Ratio..............................4:3\n\tVideo Encoder.....................................XviD0046\nAudio Stream #1\n\tCodec.............................................MPEG Audio\n\tCodec (FourCC)....................................55\n\tAudio Stream BitRate..............................128 Kbps\n\tAudio Stream BitRate Mode.........................CBR\n\tNumber of Audio Channels..........................1\n\tSampling Rate.....................................48.0 KHz\n\tAudio Encoder.....................................LAME3.98.2\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcf55ff8a7ad5c990311bf26f02b0d4a558592a5","amp;dn":"Geoff+Hamilton-A+Man+and+His+Garden-VHS+Rip+%28BBC+1999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcf55ff8a7ad5c990311bf26f02b0d4a558592a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,245,95,248,167,173,92,153,3,17,191,38,240,43,13,74,85,133,146,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
