His is World-Trance music on LSD. Move over Talvin Singh, Nitin Sawhney, bad boy and musical outcaste of the Asian mainstream has finally arrived with his own CD. For years I've had to content myself to listening to his wonderous music on various compilations CD'S of Asian Underground and Acid Jazz. I have longed for a release that was his alone. Sawhney has not disappointed. With the languid and etherial strains of exotic instrumentations, Sawhney's rythmic melodies haunt my soul. Asian and Western music collide then transform eachother into something fresh and exciting. One listen and you too, will be convinced; Nitin Sahney is a Demon-God. His music has burned my heart and bewitched my ears. - by Philip Tarley,\n\nHand-chosen by Nitin, these 12 select cuts are taken from his first two LP's for Outcaste: 'Migration' and 'Displacing the Priest'.
