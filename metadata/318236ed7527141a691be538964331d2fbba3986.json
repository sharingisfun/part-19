In fact the buzz surrounding San Antonio's Hacienda may signal a rebirth of young rock n' roll - with emphasis on the ''roll'' - to the country's landscape. Formed by cousins Abraham Villanueva (piano/vocals) and Dante Schwebel (guitar/vocals), together with Abraham's brothers Jaime (drums/vocals) and Rene Villanueva (bass/vocals), this Mexican-American quartet blends a raw yet sophisticated style of pop music with harmonies reminiscent of the Beatles and Beach Boys. As fate would have it, a demo of 6 songs landed in the hands of Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, and the band's life was forever changed. Soon after they were opening for The Black Keys in Austin Texas, as well as for Dr. Dog, gaining some much needed exposure. Under Auerbach's watch, Hacienda would write and arrange more than twenty songs, sending him demos periodically in preparation for their debut album, ultimately recording in Dan's own studio in Akron, Ohio. In order to keep the integrity of the music, ''Loud Is The Night'' was largely captured live in the room with a helping hand from new friends Scott and Frank of Dr. Dog. With them they worked on existing vocal harmonies and created new ones, greatly embellishing the album. The result is a beautiful collection of songs played with integrity and soul to spare, and while the band is aware of its 60's influences, the music on ''Loud is the Night'' is far from derivative, and the finished product is modern pop music performed with genuineness and taste. Hacienda will be on the road with Dr. Dog in September and October 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS is a very cool find from Texas. There is something to get excited about in south-central Texas. In fact the buzz surrounding San Antonio`s Hacienda may signal a rebirth of young rock n` roll -with emphasis on the &quot;roll&quot;- to the country`s landscape. Formed by cousins Abraham Villanueva (piano/vocals) and Dante Schwebel (guitar/vocals), together with Abraham`s brothers Jaime (drums/vocals) and Rene Villanueva (bass/vocals), this Mexican-American quartet blends a raw yet sophisticated style of pop music with harmonies reminiscent of the Beatles and Beach Boys.\n&quot;The opening track, &quot;She`s Got a Hold on Me,&quot; provides a sunny vocal melody that rides on a fuzzed-out bass line, dances atop a lively telecaster and fits just right between the stamping kick and clapping snare. Auerbach and Hacienda show their appreciation for 50`s dance songs with the sock-hop screamer, &quot;Hear Me Crying.&quot; The Wonders may have covered this in that Tom Hank`s flick, &quot;That Thing You Do.&quot; Not really. The tumbling drumbeat, blissful guitar and softly sweet harmonies sound first rate on the Accord`s speakers and would bop even better atop look-out point.&quot; - Horizon Online.\n\n&quot;An unabashed beauty. `Shake Ya,` for example, has hit written all over it. Belying its hip-hop title, it starts as a mid-tempo bop and then blossoms with organ fills and soaring harmonies as a seriously pretty piece of pop. Too soon it`s over. `Little Girl,` which follows, is even prettier. It uses shifts in tempo and melody, techniques reminiscent of The Beach Boys that show up in other places on the album, like `Useless and Tired.` `Sun,` another brilliant track, is an organ-driven piece that would sound at home on The Beach Boys `Smiley Smile` album. The title of the opening cut, `She`s Got a Hold on Me,` may derive from The Beatles` cover of a Miracles tune, but the music owes something to `I Feel Fine` by The Fab Four. And the tingling harmonies of `Angela` have the sound of The Turtles. `Another Day,` a dreamy piece of pop, is The Band`s Canadian Americana filtered through a south Texas lens, with a big helping of California harmony ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ if you can imagine that.&quot;-Tuscaloosa News.
