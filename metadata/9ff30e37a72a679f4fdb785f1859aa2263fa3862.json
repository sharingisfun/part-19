When her two children were young, Boylan came out as transgender, and as Jenny transitioned from a man to a woman and from a father to a mother, her family faced unique challenges and questions. In this thoughtful, tear-jerking, hilarious memoir, Jenny asks what it means to be a father, or a mother, and to what extent gender shades our experiences as parents. &quot;It is my hope,&quot; she writes, &quot;that having a father who became a woman in turn helped my sons become better men.&quot;\n\nThrough both her own story and incredibly insightful interviews with others, including Richard Russo, Edward Albee, Ann Beattie, Augusten Burroughs, Susan Minot, Trey Ellis, Timothy Kreider, and more, Jenny examines relationships with fathers and mothers, people's memories of the children they were and the parents they became, and the many different ways a family can be. Followed by an Afterword by Anna Quindlen that includes Jenny and her wife discussing the challenges they've faced and the love they share, Stuck in the Middle with You is a brilliant meditation on raising Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and on being Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a child.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ff30e37a72a679f4fdb785f1859aa2263fa3862","amp;dn":"Stuck+in+the+Middle+with+You-+A+Memoir+of+Parenting+in+Three+Gen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ff30e37a72a679f4fdb785f1859aa2263fa3862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,243,14,55,167,42,103,159,79,219,120,95,24,89,170,34,99,250,56,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
