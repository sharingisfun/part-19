Nancy Sinatra was born in the Summer of 1940, while her father, Frank Sinatra, was singing with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra; as the daughter of show business royalty, Nancy grew up in the spotlight, and made her first appearance on television with her father in 1957. It wasn't long before Nancy developed aspirations of her own as a performer -- she had studied music, dancing, and voice through much of her youth -- and in 1960 she made her debut as a professional performer on a television special hosted by her father and featuring guest star Elvis Presley, then fresh out of the Army. After appearing in a number of movies and guest starring on episodic television, Nancy was eager to break into music, and she signed a deal with her father's record label, Reprise. However, her first hit single, 1966's &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin',&quot; made it clear she had the talent and moxie to make it without her father's help. Sounding both sexy and defiant, and belting out a definitive tough-chick lyric over a brassy arrangement by Bill Strange (and with the cream of L.A.'s session players behind her), &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin'&quot; was an immediate and unstoppable hit, and took the &quot;tuff girl&quot; posturing of the Shangri-Las and the Ronettes to a whole new level.

It focuses mostly on material penned by Hazlewood and has comprehensive liner notes. An Australian best-of on the Raven label, Lightning's Girl, has a few more songs, but this less expensive 18-track stateside compilation covers all the key bases. \n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-hit-years-r18058&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-hit-years-r18058&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003490&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003490&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
