Members of Doomtree bring various bases of knowledge and musical backgrounds together to create alternative-influenced rap and hip-hop music. Nearly as prominent as the influence of hip-hop in their music is that of punk, and their lyrics are frequently introspective. They often do shows with fellow Minnesota hip-hop label Rhymesayers Entertainment. Emcees perform solo or with one another, each contributing a different approach to their music. Doomtree's self-released, self-titled debut album as a group was released on July 29, 2008.\n\nDoomtree albums\n\nCecil Otter - Rebel yello\nDessa - A Badly Broken Code\nDessa - False Hopes\nDoomtree - False Hopes 15\nDoomtree - False Hopes\nMike Mitchlan &amp; Lazerbreak - Hand Over Fist\nP.O.S. - Audition\nP.O.S. - Ipecac Neat\nP.O.S. - Never Better\nPaper Tiger - False Hopes\nSims - False Hopes XIV\nSims Lights Out Paris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68fd11c9590a704f3f13bcae1d3485892b17c564","amp;dn":"Doomtree+almost+every+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68fd11c9590a704f3f13bcae1d3485892b17c564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,253,17,201,89,10,112,79,63,19,188,174,29,52,133,137,43,23,197,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
