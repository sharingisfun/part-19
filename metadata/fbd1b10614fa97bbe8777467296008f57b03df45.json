It was not released as a Yamaha product, but a software package of Vocaloid Singer Libraries was developed by third party licensees which included Yamaha&amp;#039;s Vocaloid software. Leon, Lola, and Miriam have been released from Zero-G Limited, UK, while Meiko and Kaito have been released from Crypton Future Media, Japan.\n\nIn January 2007, Yamaha announced a new version of the software engine, Vocaloid2, with various major improvements in usability and synthesis quality. Zero-G and others have announced plans to release products powered by the new software engine in 2007. PowerFX have released the first English package that is powered by Vocaloid2 named Sweet Ann. Prima was released in the UK. Crypton has followed and announced a series of character Vocaloid2 packages to be released, the first being Hatsune Miku.\n\nHatsune Miku, Hatsune Miku?) is the first installment in the Vocaloid Character Vocal Series released on August 31, 2007. The name of the title and the character of the software was chosen by combining Hatsu (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, First?), Ne , and Miku. The data for the voice was created by actually sampling the voice of Saki Fujita, a Japanese voice actress. Unlike general purpose speech synthesizers, the software is tuned to create J-pop songs commonly heard in anime, but it is possible to create songs from other genres.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd1b10614fa97bbe8777467296008f57b03df45","amp;dn":"Miku+Hatsune+-+1st+song+album+VOCALOID2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd1b10614fa97bbe8777467296008f57b03df45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,209,177,6,20,250,151,187,232,119,116,103,41,96,8,245,123,3,223,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
