The Association of Energy Engineers is a non profit professional society which provides continuing education programs to the energy efficiency community. During this period, the Association of Energy Engineers has grown to 8500 members in 77 countries. No other publication has been as influential in defining the energy management profession. Like the Association of Energy Engineers, the Energy Management Handbook was originally launched in the late 1970s. \n\nIn 1981 the Association of Energy Engineers started its most successful program, the Certified Energy Manager (CEM). To date, over 6500 professionals\nhave been recognized as CEMs. The Energy Management Handbook has served as the official reference book for the CEM program. Today, the energy efficiency industry is poised for new growth, and the Energy Management Handbook is more important than ever before. The Energy Management Handbook offers real solutions to reduce energy costs by utilizing the latest energy efficient technologies and alternative energy strategies, as well as incorporating principles of green buildings and sustainable design.
