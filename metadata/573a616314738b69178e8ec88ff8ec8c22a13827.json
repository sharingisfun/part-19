For whatever reason, if something happens to your current OS and it won't boot or something else just as drastic happens and you need to keep working on something, this disk can come to the rescue. There's over 400 apps available that should cover most tasks. If you need to diagnose what went wrong and fix it, this is your disk. Load up XP without affecting your system files and find out what went wrong. Many many many recovery and diagnostic programs have been included.\n\nThe following apps are integrated into the explorer shell: 7-Zip, Bulk Rename Utility, CMD anywhere, Copy Path, ImgBurn, Notepad++, Registry Editor PE, RunScanner (run any EXE and point it to remote registry), Run with arguments..., ServicesPE and WinRAR. Also, PDF-XChange Viewer will open PDF files automatically, and Irfan View will open all the files it recognizes (mostly graphics but also audio files and HEAPS of others). Also integrated are Windows Scripting (WSH), Visual Basic (VB6), and AutoIT (au3)\n\nThe following aps are automatically loaded on boot: Unlocker (file unlocker), MultiRes (screen resolution), System Explorer (a far superior task manager), and PowerMenu (gives you more Task Bar window tab options).\n\n* About 400 apps are available, the shortcuts are dynamically created at boot time.\n\nAll credit goes to the creator, and his aknowledged sources\n\n\n\nurl of support forum, and author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sharethefiles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=114243&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sharethefiles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=114243&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:573a616314738b69178e8ec88ff8ec8c22a13827","amp;dn":"Windows.XP.Live%21.DVD.December.2010.SOPORIFIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"573a616314738b69178e8ec88ff8ec8c22a13827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,58,97,99,20,115,139,105,23,142,142,200,143,248,236,140,34,161,56,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
