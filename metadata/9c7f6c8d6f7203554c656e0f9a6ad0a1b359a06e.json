After serving in the navy during World War II , he attended Yale, and upon graduation began an acting career that would take him from a made-for-television Disney western to Hollywood, where he was featured in several B movies as well as Otto PremingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Cardinal. PremingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treatment of Tryon was so cruel as to become a Hollywood legend, and Tryon turned to writing. His first book, The Other (1971), was an immediate success, spending more than six months on the New York Times best-seller list and allowing him to quit acting for good; a film adaptation, with a screenplay by Tryon and directed by Robert Mulligan, appeared in 1972. Tryon wrote two more novels set in the fictional Pequot Landing of The Other, Harvest Home (1973) and Lady (1974), before turning to works like All That Glitters (1986), that explore the dark side of the golden age of Hollywood. At the time of his death Tryon was working on a historical trilogy set in early nineteenth-century Connecticut.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHolland and Niles Perry are identical thirteen-year-old twins. They are close, close enough, almost, to read each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughts, but they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be more different. Holland is bold and mischievous, a bad influence, while Niles is kind and eager to please, the sort of boy who makes parents proud. The Perrys live in the bucolic New England town their family settled centuries ago, and as it happens, the extended clan has gathered at its ancestral farm this summer to mourn the death of the twinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ father in a most unfortunate accident. Mrs. Perry still hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recovered from the shock of her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gruesome end and stays sequestered in her room, leaving her sons to roam free. As the summer goes on, though, and HollandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pranks become increasingly sinister, Niles finds he can no longer make excuses for his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions. \nThomas TryonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling novel about a homegrown monster is an eerie examination of the darkness that dwells within everyone. It is a landmark of psychological horror that is a worthy descendent of the books of James Hogg, Robert Louis Stevenson, Shirley Jackson, and Patricia Highsmith.\n\nIt is perhaps unfair and a little inaccurate to typecast The Other as a horror story. It is so ingenious and well-written that it transcends thatÃ¢â‚¬â€or anyÃ¢â‚¬â€label. The setting is the small Connecticut town of Pequot Landing, which under other circumstances, might be idyllic. But the people who inhabit TryonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New England are just as haunted as OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢NeillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, and a lot more violentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦His [TryonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] characterizations have depth and subtlety, the narrative is well-paced and suspenseful. Where he really excels is with mood and atmosphere. Rarely have such commonplace surroundings been made to seem quite so dark and menacing and chillingly evil.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œChicago Tribune\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book:\n\n* The Other, afterword by Dan Chaon - ePUB, Pg. 272\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Tryon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Tryon&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/the-other-tryon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/the-other-tryon/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c7f6c8d6f7203554c656e0f9a6ad0a1b359a06e","amp;dn":"The+Other+-+Thomas+Tryon+%282012%2C+NYRB+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c7f6c8d6f7203554c656e0f9a6ad0a1b359a06e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,127,108,141,111,114,3,85,76,101,110,15,154,106,208,161,179,89,160,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
