This one is complete, including the book and all*\n\nDr. Fredric Wertham wrote a book that shook the comic industry, but if the world was a sane place it really shouldn't have!\n\nAs a thesis it's laughable! Worthy of a -F only! Little effort was done to treat sources legit, or even trying to define the sort of books he critisized!\n\nDon't ever trust a criminal, who say his/her crimes were influences by comics/movies/videogames/other but who can't mention a single specific title!\n\nIn the end, it all came down to the rant of a crank, with the conclusion that publishers were the ones to really be held responsible for the horrible actions of violent criminals!\n\nNonetheless the book was influental, and indirectly caused the most hated Comic Book Code. All while film studios continued to pour out movies with similar content.\n\nJust how? Read the book yourself, and try to figure it out!\n\nAnd when your done, you might start to wonder about the books that after all are mentioned with a title. Could they really be that bad?\n\nSo included is a good chunk of the mentioned books!\n\nNow you can be the judge!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36248577a01c02293d844ec6c3b4945d28d14ab2","amp;dn":"Fredric+Wertham%3A+Seduction+of+the+Innocent+%2B+The+Comic+Books%21+%28F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36248577a01c02293d844ec6c3b4945d28d14ab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,36,133,119,160,28,2,41,61,132,78,198,195,180,148,93,40,209,74,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
