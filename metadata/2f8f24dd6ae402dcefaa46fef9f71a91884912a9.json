Cousar &amp; Beverly R. Gaventa &amp; James D. Newsome &amp; J. Clinton McCann - Texts for Preaching: A Lectionary Commentary Based on the NRSV (Years A, B and C)(Westminster John Knox Press, 1993-1995). 1850 pages.\n\nRetail pdf.\n\nShort description:\n\nLectionary commentary covering all three years of the Revised Common Lectionary. Not fundamentalist in orientation -- rather it's mainline Protestant, moderate to liberal.\n\nDescription:\n\nBased on the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible, this unique and comprehensive resource provides resources for an entire year of sermons and offers practical help to preachers and others involved using the Revised Common Lectionary. Beginning with Advent, it deals with the texts for Years A, B and C. Each of the four texts--the Old Testament, Psalter, Gospel, and Epistle--are treated in relation to each Sunday and important festival day, including Christmas, Ash Wednesday, and Good Friday. A brief introduction gives the general thrust of the texts and the relationship among them with emphasis upon interpretation of the texts. Suggestions concerning the implications for life today are also included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8f24dd6ae402dcefaa46fef9f71a91884912a9","amp;dn":"Brueggemann+et+al+-+Texts+for+Preaching%3A+A+Lectionary+Commentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8f24dd6ae402dcefaa46fef9f71a91884912a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,143,36,221,106,228,2,220,239,170,70,254,249,247,26,145,136,73,18,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
