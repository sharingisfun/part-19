That&amp;#039;s arguable, but there&amp;#039;s no doubt that the late John Lee Hooker (1917-2001) was in a class by himself, a genuine original whose music--raw, primitively simple, scary even, powered by his deep moan of a voice--was the very embodiment of the Delta blues style. Big names like Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, and many more line up to pay tribute to the man in this absorbing 90-minute documentary; there are also plenty of interviews with family, friends, business associates, and the grizzled, laconic bluesman himself, along with some decent performance footage (as is usual in such projects, we get no complete songs). But this 2000 film&amp;#039;s best moments come courtesy of writer-director Joerg Bundschuh&amp;#039;s beautifully photographed contemporary footage, with no accompaniment except the hypnotic groove and profound soul of John Lee Hooker&amp;#039;s music.\n\n\nPlayers: \nEric Clapton\nRobert Cray\nFito De la Parra\nBuddy Guy\nJohn Hammond\nJohn Lee Hooker\nZakiya Hooker\nEddie Kirkland\nJohn Mayall\nCharlie Musselwhite\nBonnie Raitt ... a.o.\n\nDVD9 - PAL - original&amp;#039;s copy.\n16:9 - That&amp;#039;s My Story\n4:3  -  Stanford&amp;#039;s concert.  \nDD 2.0: English and german.\nSubs.: Spanish, german, dutch, italian and french.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc1e7049b9e0d47c6413c5b9aac251e37aec398d","amp;dn":"John+Lee+Hooker+-+That%5C%27s+My+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc1e7049b9e0d47c6413c5b9aac251e37aec398d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,30,112,73,185,224,212,124,100,19,197,185,170,194,81,227,122,236,57,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
