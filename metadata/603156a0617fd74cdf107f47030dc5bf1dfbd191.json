In Meet Kit, her father must close his car dealership and join the large number of unemployed. In an effort to make ends meet, her mother takes in boarders; Mrs. Howard and her son Stirling settle into Kit's newly redecorated bedroom, while the girl makes the best of her new space in the attic.\n\nThis comes bundled with every Kit Kittredge doll bought from American Girl, whether you got her online, or if you had the lulz to waltz inside the AG Place and fork over a hundred bucks for it. It can be bought standalone, though, and with AG discontinuing their old historical line in favour of the BeForever reboot, I thought maybe we could post at least some of the old books for those who were missing out on things","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603156a0617fd74cdf107f47030dc5bf1dfbd191","amp;dn":"Valerie+Tripp+-+Meet+Kit%3A+An+American+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603156a0617fd74cdf107f47030dc5bf1dfbd191","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,49,86,160,97,127,215,76,223,16,127,71,3,13,197,191,29,251,209,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
