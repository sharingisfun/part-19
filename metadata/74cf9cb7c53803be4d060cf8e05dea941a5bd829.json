This turned out not merely to be a nice way to undercut expectations, but a creative benchmark for the group, arguably its artistic peak. [...] Strong tracks are legion, including 'One of the Three,' allegedly about British hostages in Lebanon but much more accurately a sharp, harrowing meditation on Jesus and apparently meaningless sacrifice, and the low-key beauties of 'Out to Get You' and 'Knuckle Too Far.' But the best punch is right at the end -- the heartbreaking 'Lullaby,' a piano-led sigh of regret and wistful hope, and 'Skindiving,' Booth's near-wordless keen at his most affecting, floating over the low-volume shuffle and bite of the band.&quot;\n\nRipped with EAC v0.99 pre-beta, in lossless FLAC format.\n\nTracks:\n\n1.
