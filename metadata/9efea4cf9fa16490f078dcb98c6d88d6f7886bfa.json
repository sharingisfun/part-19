I added handy bookmarks to the pdf, used OCR Text Recognition, and optimized the pdf already so you don't have to.  This solutions manual will work for the 3rd edition of the book as well I think (so far I have only looked at the homework for the first chapter).  This solutions manual looks like it was scanned originally, and that the book writers wrote the whole thing by hand!  Kind of ridiculous if you ask me as their hand writing gets quite small and hard to read sometimes.  Oh well, get those A's, and learn about some Electromagnetism.  \nGod Bless.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9efea4cf9fa16490f078dcb98c6d88d6f7886bfa","amp;dn":"Applied+Electromagnetism+2nd+Ed+-+Solutions+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9efea4cf9fa16490f078dcb98c6d88d6f7886bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,254,164,207,159,161,100,144,240,120,220,185,140,109,136,214,247,136,107,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
