The Denton, TX band, known for its haunting, claustrophobic take on drunken folk, needed ten full years to bare its heartsÃ¢â‚¬â€one of which is in the album title, Jackleg Devotional to the Heart, a name that songwriter Chris Flemmons conjured shortly after he recorded, and then trashed, the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first attempt in 2005.\n\nFlemmons goes so far as to call this his Ã¢â‚¬Å“love album,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an apt descriptionÃ¢â‚¬â€though love through The Baptist GeneralsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eyes is plenty complicated. JacklegÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs hearts donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resemble valentines. No smooth curls into a final point. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vibraphones, guitarrons and ambient feedback combine like a mess of ventricles, aortas and veinsÃ¢â‚¬â€not to mention, from the sound of it, all of the blood spilled while Jackleg lurched for years toward an eventual finish line.\n\nCall it a love record, then. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the kind of love Flemmons had to figure out in the ten years since The Baptist GeneralsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ critically-acclaimed 2003 full-length debut No Silver/No Gold, a period in which he admits heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fallen in love with a wild spectrum of musicÃ¢â‚¬â€the Ethiopiques series, saxophonist Archie Shepp, film scorer Meredith Willson, and plenty more. That wide spectrum only befits JacklegÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs repeated need to buck genre; in fact, the 2005 version of the album hit the trash heap because Ã¢â‚¬Å“it sounded like any other indie rock-type band,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Flemmons admits. Co-produced by Stuart Sikes (Loretta Lynn, Cat Power, The Walkmen, Modest Mouse, The White Stripes) and the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jason Reimer, Jackleg Devotional to the Heart sounds like exactly no one else.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92e0126ee8fc99fde72c6ff989ba10cd57aacd2c","amp;dn":"The+Baptist+Generals+-+Jackleg+Devotional+to+the+Heart+%5B2013%5D%5BFL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92e0126ee8fc99fde72c6ff989ba10cd57aacd2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,224,18,110,232,252,153,253,231,44,111,249,137,186,16,205,87,170,205,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
