House pioneered an innovative style featuring strong, repetitive rhythms, often played with the aid of slide guitar, and his singing often incorporated elements of southern gospel and spiritual (music).\n\nHe was an important influence on Muddy Waters and also on Robert Johnson, who would later take this style of music to new levels. A seminal Delta blues figure, House remains influential today[3], with his music being covered by blues-rock groups such as The White Stripes.\n\nRead more at Wikipedia: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_House&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_House&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a69c41523c4f26667fe446cd3d94a825c4c95e7","amp;dn":"Eddie+James+%28Son%29+House","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a69c41523c4f26667fe446cd3d94a825c4c95e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,105,196,21,35,196,242,102,103,254,68,108,211,217,74,130,92,76,149,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
