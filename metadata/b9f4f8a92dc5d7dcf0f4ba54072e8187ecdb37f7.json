How are ancient civilizations linked together and what does it say about human instinct? Join Dr Kara Cooney, UCLA Professor of Egyptian Art and Architecture, as she visits tombs and temples around the world bringing an exciting new perspective to the most fascinating riddles in history.\n\n\n1)  Sins of the City \nToday's city dwellers may think of urban living as an improvement over the existence of our hunting and gathering ancestors. But Egyptologist Dr. Kara Cooney explains that our modern tendency to live in cities isn't the result of an inevitable march towards progress. Beginning roughly 12,000 years ago, a sudden change in human behavior determined the very nature of modern civilization. And archaeological evidence from some of the world's first cities -- such as Jericho in the West Bank of Palestine, Catal Huyuk in Turkey, and even early prehistoric settlements in Egypt -- suggests that living in cities may bring just as many problems as it solves.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2185 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 43:32.560\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 743 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f4f8a92dc5d7dcf0f4ba54072e8187ecdb37f7","amp;dn":"DC.Out.of.Egypt.1of6.Sins.of.the.City.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f4f8a92dc5d7dcf0f4ba54072e8187ecdb37f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,244,248,169,45,197,215,220,240,244,186,84,7,46,129,135,236,219,55,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
