Listening to the show of nearly 2 hours &amp; 28 songs (as Elvis says, &quot;We'll sing all night, as long as you want to hear us&quot;) it is impossible to believe that in less than 8 months he would be dead. This really was Elvis' last magnificent performance.\n\nRipped with Rubyripper 0.6.2 on Ubuntu 14.04\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed please!\n\njoh73 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b46e1eee06d5d8c2b20deb9dd966916fc022df","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+New+Year%27s+Eve+31-12-76","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90b46e1eee06d5d8c2b20deb9dd966916fc022df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,180,110,30,238,6,213,216,194,178,13,235,157,217,102,145,111,192,34,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
