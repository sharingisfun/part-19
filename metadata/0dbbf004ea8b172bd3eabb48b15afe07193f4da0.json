With Jean-Pierre LÃƒÂ©aud, Catherine-Isabelle Duport, Jacqueline Bir\nBelgium 1967, 35mm, b/w, 93 min. French with English subtitles\n\nBy making his first non-Polish film in Belgium with nouvelle vague icon Jean-Pierre LÃƒÂ©aud and his Masculin-FÃƒÂ©minin co-star Catherine Duport, Skolimowski engaged in an open dialogue with the French New Wave to which his films had been compared from the very beginning. In his irrepressible portrayal of a hairdresser obsessed with race cars and his dream of entering the fastest model Porsche in a weekend rally, LÃƒÂ©aud offers an energized and eccentric variation of the drifting young men in SkolimowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early films. Le DÃƒÂ©partÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s zany story of racing and intrigue is fascinating for its vision of a postwar Europe obsessed with speed and modernization, a theme infused with a gentle melancholy by KomedaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s haunting, jazz inflected score. - Source: http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2011aprjun/skolimowski.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dbbf004ea8b172bd3eabb48b15afe07193f4da0","amp;dn":"Jerzy+Skolimowski+-+Le+Depart+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dbbf004ea8b172bd3eabb48b15afe07193f4da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,187,240,4,234,139,23,43,211,234,187,72,177,90,254,7,25,63,77,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
