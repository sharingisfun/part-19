The vagaries of the Fairchilds are keenly observed, and sometimes harshly judged, by nine-year-old Laura McRaven, a Fairchild cousin who takes The Yellow Dog train to the Delta for Dabney FairchildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wedding. An only child whose mother has just died, Laura is resentful of her boisterous, careless cousins, and desperate for their acceptance. As the hour moves closer and closer to wedding day, Laura arrives at a more subtle understanding of both the Fairchilds and herself. Born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi, Eudora Welty is one of the SouthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest novelists. She won a Pulitzer in 1972 for The OptimistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Daughter. Delta Wedding is her best known work.\n\n[Eudora is the best known email software named for her :]\n\n  Awards - AudioFile Earphones Award","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb9220ceb8b5ab2e3df774eeb24b3cc02e767c47","amp;dn":"DELTA+WEDDING+-+Eudora+Welty.+Read+by+Sally+Darling+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb9220ceb8b5ab2e3df774eeb24b3cc02e767c47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,146,32,206,184,181,171,46,61,247,116,238,178,75,60,192,46,118,124,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
