This first pressing does have its subtleties, as those more intrigued by a rougher, independent sound should enjoy the production quality of this effort. Overall it is identical, only lacking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTimothy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a song that was included on the re-release. For those into politically driven, emotional hardcore punk, Boy Sets Fire is arguably one of the best, and this happened to be their breakthrough album, which found the band courted and later signed by the label otherwise known for modern rock monsters\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 2001\nLabel: Victory Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Post Hardcore, Punk\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating: 4 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n1.
