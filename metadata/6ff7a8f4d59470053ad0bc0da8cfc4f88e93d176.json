Dense urban living has been prescribed as a panacea for the environmental and resource crises of our time. But is it better or worse for our happiness? Are subways, sidewalks, and tower dwelling an improvement on the car-dependence of sprawl?\n\nThe award-winning journalist Charles Montgomery finds answers to such questions at the intersection between urban design and the emerging science of happiness, and during an exhilarating journey through some of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most dynamic\n\ncities. He meets the visionary mayor who introduced a Ã¢â‚¬Å“sexyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lipstick-red bus to ease status anxiety in BogotÃƒÂ¡; the architect who brought the lessons of medieval Tuscan hill towns to modern-day New York City; the activist who turned ParisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s urban freeways into beaches; and an army of American suburbanites who have transformed their lives by hacking the design of their streets and neighborhoods.\n\nFull of rich historical detail and new insights from psychologists and MontgomeryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own urban experiments, Happy City is an essential tool for understanding and improving our own communities. The message is as surprising as it is hopeful: by retrofitting our cities for happiness, we can tackle the urgent challenges of our age. The happy city, the green city, and the low-carbon city are the same place, and we can all help build it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ff7a8f4d59470053ad0bc0da8cfc4f88e93d176","amp;dn":"Happy+City+-+Transforming+Our+Lives+Through+Urban+Design+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ff7a8f4d59470053ad0bc0da8cfc4f88e93d176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,247,168,244,213,148,112,5,58,208,188,13,168,207,196,248,142,147,209,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
