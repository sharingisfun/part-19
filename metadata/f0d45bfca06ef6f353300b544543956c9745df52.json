CAN \r\n\r\nENLIGHTENMENT BE THE TOPMOST PLEASURE, AS A DEFINITION?\r\n\r\nANSWER: It is not pleasure....\r\n....................\r\nat the end..\r\n\r\nQUESTION: THIS CAN MAKE THE HEADLINES OF THE VATICAN! WHEN YOU SIT IN THE CHAIR YOU TRANSCEND ANY SEXUAL DEFINITION. BUT WHEN YOU DANCE WITH A FEMALE DISCIPLE, YOU ARE REAL MACAO (MACHO?)-LOOKING. WHY SUCH A DIFFERENCE?\r\n\r\nANSWER: You think that even while dancing I should look as if I am sitting in the chair? Or vice versa -- sitting in the chair I should look as if I am dancing? The change is bound to be there -- sitting in the chair is a different posture, dancing is a different posture, eating at my table is a different posture. They have to be different. They simply show that man is not linear, that man is multi-dimensional. Dancing with a woman, certainly I have to be respectful to a woman. I am not a homosexual.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A LATIN LOVER?\r\n\r\nANSWER: Yes, certainly. I am a lover, and every gesture of mine shows that I am a lover. I love every beautiful thing in the world, and that is my teaching to my people: love everything beautiful in the world. Okay? Can we dance now?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0d45bfca06ef6f353300b544543956c9745df52","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Last+Testament_Vol-3+%2307_OK+can+we+dance+now","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0d45bfca06ef6f353300b544543956c9745df52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,212,91,252,160,110,246,243,83,48,11,84,69,67,149,108,151,69,223,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
