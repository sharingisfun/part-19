He was influential in the evolution of modern Celtic fusion, a blending of traditional Celtic and modern music.\n\nHe began playing the Great Highland Bagpipes at the age of 10, and by the time he was 12 he was winning prizes at piping competitions in Scotland. \nIn 1996, Bennett released his first self-titled album on Eclectic Records. In 1998 he released Bothy Culture, his most successful album. In 2000, just a few months after a highly acclaimed headlining set at the Cambridge Folk Festival, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nAbout this torrent:\nI decided to upload this after my long search for these four CDs in original. It seems impossible to get my hands on all of them, I still don't have a original copy of Hardland. \nSo this torrent is here to make these CDs available to more people. But as always: if you like the music please buy it if you're able to! Again, I also experienced that this can be quite difficult.\n\nThe albums:\n1996 - Martyn Bennett\n1997 - Bothy Culture\n2000 - Hardland\n2003 - Grit\n\nAll in ~265 kbps VBR MP3. Only thing missing are proper illustrations for Hardland.\n\nThis is my first torrent, feedback is always welcome. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4628e220dbc918f144088f05efb9cb21aefedac","amp;dn":"Martyn+Bennett+-+Four+CDs+265kbps+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4628e220dbc918f144088f05efb9cb21aefedac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,98,142,34,13,188,145,143,20,64,136,240,94,251,156,178,26,239,237,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
