For more than forty years, Hitchens delivered to numerous publications on both sides of the Atlantic essays that were astonishingly wide-ranging and provocative. The judges for the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay, posthumously bestowed on Hitchens, praised him for the way he wrote â€œwith fervor about the books and writers he loved and with unbridled venom about ideas and political figures he loathed.â€ He could write, the judges went on to say, with â€œundisguised brio, mining the resources of the language as if alert to every possibility of color and inflection.â€ He was, as Benjamin Schwarz, his editor at The Atlantic magazine, recalled, â€œslashing and lively, biting and funnyâ€”and with a nuanced sensibility and a refined ear that he kept in tune with his encyclopedic knowledge and near photographic memory of English poetry.â€ And as Michael Dirda, writing in the Times Literary Supplement, observed, Hitchens â€œwas a flail and a scourge, but also a gift to readers everywhere.â€\r\n\r\nThe author of five previous volumes of selected writings, including the international bestseller Arguably, Hitchens left at his death nearly 250,000 words of essays not yet published in book form. And Yetâ€¦ assembles a selection that usefully adds to Hitchensâ€™s oeuvre. It ranges from the literary to the political and is, by turns, a banquet of entertaining and instructive delights, including essays on Orwell, Lermontov, Chesterton, Fleming, Naipaul, Rushdie, Pamuk, and Dickens, among others, as well as his laugh-out-loud self-mocking â€œmakeover.â€ The range and quality of Hitchensâ€™s essays transcend the particular occasions for which they were originally written. Often prescient, always pugnacious, and formidably learned, Hitchens was a polemicist for the ages. With this posthumous volume, his reputation and his readers will continue to grow.\r\n\r\nChristopher Hitchens was the cartographer of his own literary and political explorations. He sought assiduously to affirmâ€”and to reaffirmâ€”the ideas of secularism, reason, libertarianism, internationalism, and solidarity, values always under siege and ever in need of defending. Henry James once remarked, â€œNothing is my last word on anything.â€ For Hitchens, as for James, there was always more to be said","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a740e0d7d537039ec6fd7cd530ccfcd0b7d288ca","amp;dn":"And+Yet_._+Essays+-+Christopher+Hitchens.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a740e0d7d537039ec6fd7cd530ccfcd0b7d288ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,64,224,215,213,55,3,158,198,253,124,213,48,204,252,208,183,210,136,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
