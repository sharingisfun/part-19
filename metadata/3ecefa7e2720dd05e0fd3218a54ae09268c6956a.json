Within a generation it had become a basic notion of our everyday moral life, replacing older reproaches like lout and heel with a single inclusive categoryÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œa staple of country outlaw songs, Neil Simon plays, and Woody Allen movies. Feminists made it their stock rebuke for male insensitivity, the est movement used it for those who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬Å“get it,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Dirty Harry applied it evenhandedly to both his officious superiors and the punks he manhandled.\n\n\nThe asshole has become a focus of collective fascination for us, just as the phony was for Holden Caulfield and the cad was for Anthony Trollope. From Donald Trump to Ann Coulter, from Mel Gibson to Anthony Weiner, from the reality TV prima donnas to the internet trolls and flamers, assholism has become the characteristic form of modern incivility, which implicitly expresses our deepest values about class, relationships, authenticity, and fairness. We have conflicting attitudes about the A-wordÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œwhen a presidential candidate unwittingly uttered it on a live mic in 2000, it confirmed to some that he was a man of the people and to others that he was a boor. But considering how much the word does for us, and to us, it hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gotten nearly the attention it deservesÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œat least until now.[/i]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ecefa7e2720dd05e0fd3218a54ae09268c6956a","amp;dn":"Ascent+of+the+A-Word-+Assholism%2C+the+First+Sixty+Years+by+Geoffr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ecefa7e2720dd05e0fd3218a54ae09268c6956a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,206,250,126,39,32,221,5,224,253,50,24,165,74,224,146,104,198,149,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
