The challenging material (&quot;The Song Is You&quot; is the only one of the five songs that is a standard) inspires the musicians to play creative solos. It is particularly interesting to hear Baker interpret the Wayne Shorter tune &quot;ESP.&quot; This set has been reissued on CD in the OJC series.\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Tidal Breeze 6:46\n2 Shifting Down 7:28\n3 ESP 5:38\n4 The Song Is You 9:14\n5 Once Upon A Summertime 11:20\n\n\nCredits\n\nBass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ron Carter\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mel Lewis\nPiano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harold Danko\nTenor Saxophone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gregory Herbert\nTrumpet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chet Baker\n\nNotes\n\nRecorded February 20, 1977 at Sound Ideas Studios, New York, NY ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3092eecb517bbc0a62889e9a67f2844ad6e8ed20","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+Once+upon+a+summertime+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3092eecb517bbc0a62889e9a67f2844ad6e8ed20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,146,238,203,81,123,188,10,98,136,158,154,103,242,132,74,214,232,237,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
