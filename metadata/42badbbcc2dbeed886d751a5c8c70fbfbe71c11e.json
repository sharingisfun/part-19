Now every Interstellar Police officer on Alberon is searching for him. If they don't find him, one of his fellow contractors certainly will â€¦ and the most feared criminal organization in the galaxy has severe punishments for employees who break the rules. Rath's only hope is to find the rogue contractor who helped him escape a company deathtrap after his final mission.
