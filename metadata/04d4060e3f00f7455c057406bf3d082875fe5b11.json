Out of these 4 records, Paparazzi's unreleased LP &quot;Cold In A Warm Climate&quot; is one of my all time favorites. highly recommended. Also fans of Tuxedomoon will probably like to find out how the solo effort of Winston Tong sounds like. Tirez Tirez &quot;Etudes&quot; is an extremely rare record and much sought-after! Also the fantastic glam-rock record from boys of Airdrie, United Kingdom &quot;The Big Dish&quot; speaks for itself. Great record. Hope you enjoy these!\n\n\nBig Dish - Swimmer [1986]\n\nPaparazzi - Cold in A Warm Climate [1984]\n\nTirez Tirez  - Etudes [1980]\n\nWinston Tong - Theoritically Chinese [1985]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04d4060e3f00f7455c057406bf3d082875fe5b11","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+27%5D+New+Wave%2C+Glam+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04d4060e3f00f7455c057406bf3d082875fe5b11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,212,6,14,63,0,247,69,92,5,116,6,191,61,8,40,117,254,91,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
