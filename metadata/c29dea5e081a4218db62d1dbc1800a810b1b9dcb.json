He is the oldest son of the real Ip Man.\n\nThe film focuses on Ip Man's early life and the story of how he learnt Wing Chun. In contrast, Ip Man and Ip Man 2 focus on the events in his life that took place during the Second Sino-Japanese War and after he moved to Hong Kong.\n\nAs a child, Ip Man learns Wing Chun from Chan Wah-shun together with Ip Tin-chi and Lee Mei-wai. After Chan's death, Ip continues to learn Wing Chun from his senior, Ng Chung-sok, before eventually leaving Foshan to study in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, Ip is bullied and humiliated by foreigners, who look down on him. During that time, he meets master Leung Bik, who is actually the son of Leung Jan, Chan Wah-shun's teacher. Ip learns a different style of Wing Chun from Leung and his prowess in martial arts improves tremendously.\n\nIp returns to Foshan years later and falls in love with Cheung Wing-shing, the daughter of the vice-mayor of Foshan. However, he would later discover that he needs to overcome obstacles to be with her. At the same time, Ip reunites with his fellows and Ng Chung-sok sees that Ip had mastered a new style of Wing Chun from Leung Bik, which differs from Chan Wah-shun's orthodox style. Both of them start to have disagreements over how the art should be practised.\n\nUPLOADER NOTES\nSORRY NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES YET...HARDCODE CHINESE SUBTITLES...I THINK THIS IS MISLABELED BECAUSE NOT DVDRip QUALITY...BUT STILL GOOD QUALITY FOR A MOVIE THAT WAS JUST RELEASED 24 June 2010 IN THEATERS...PLEASE COMMENT :)\n\ncredit ZJM BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/2817/vlcsnap2010072023h57m09.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/2817/vlcsnap2010072023h57m09.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/8475/vlcsnap2010072023h52m29.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/8475/vlcsnap2010072023h52m29.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/6260/vlcsnap2010072023h58m55.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/6260/vlcsnap2010072023h58m55.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/811/vlcsnap2010072100h00m41.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/811/vlcsnap2010072100h00m41.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/7712/vlcsnap2010072100h01m01.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/7712/vlcsnap2010072100h01m01.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK ME...THANK MC8 &amp; HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c29dea5e081a4218db62d1dbc1800a810b1b9dcb","amp;dn":"The.Legend.is.Born-Ip.Man.2010.DVDRip.XviD-ZJM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c29dea5e081a4218db62d1dbc1800a810b1b9dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,157,234,94,8,26,66,24,219,98,209,219,193,128,10,129,11,27,157,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
