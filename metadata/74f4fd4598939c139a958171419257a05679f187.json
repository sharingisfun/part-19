The story begins in a courtroom and it is told through flashbacks. This is a story of how a black soldier in the face of danger from the Indians can be so easily mistaken as a criminal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74f4fd4598939c139a958171419257a05679f187","amp;dn":"Sergeant+Rutledge++%28Western+1960%29++Jeffrey+Hunter%2C+Constance+Tow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74f4fd4598939c139a958171419257a05679f187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,244,253,69,152,147,156,19,154,149,129,113,65,146,87,160,86,121,241,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
