Very Cool SPOOKY MUSIC!\n\nSPOOKY SOUTHCOAST INTERVIEWS BRIAN FROM \\\\\\&quot;TAPS\\\\\\&quot; (GHOST HUNTERS TV SHOW)\nRecorded this from the Internet. Spooky Southcoast is a radio program that broadcasts every Saterday night. They interview Brian from TAPS (Ghost Hunters). Cool parts to listen for is when Brian tells of the time he went on an investigation with Keith and an old woman becomes POSESSED and her eyes, ALL of her eyes!, turn black and she starts cursing and laughing hysterically at Brian! He says he started yelling for Keith! COOL!\n\nAnd last, but not least,...\n\nART BELL -GHOST TO GHOST RADIO BROADCASTS FROM 1996 TO 2005\nArt had his own radio broadcast and would, about once a year, mostly in October to celebrate Halloween, allow ordinary people call in and tell their own ghost stories, personal stories of ghostly things that have happened to them. This show was broadcast ALL NIGHT so it was always a little eerie to listen to some of these peoples stories at night, in the dark. These are RANDOM files I have put together, some with the commercials intact, others with the commercials edited out. Some of these broadcast will last about 3 to 4 hours.\n\nENJOY! \nHAPPY HALLOWEEN!\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83240ad014250c118251737b71d6040782d6ed7e","amp;dn":"Unsolved.Mysteries.GHOSTS.AVIs.%2B.MORE.Halloween","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83240ad014250c118251737b71d6040782d6ed7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,36,10,208,20,37,12,17,130,81,115,123,113,214,4,7,130,214,237,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
