And on his self-titled release Ã¢â‚¬â€ his debut on Jack WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Third Man Records Ã¢â‚¬â€ LaFarge\nblends these musical styles better than ever before.\n\nWhile his last studio album, 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Middle of Everywhere, felt rushed at times and almost jittery, the new record mellows\nout over the course of its 12 still diverse tracks. LaFarge no longer tries to fit as many words as possible in one breath\ninstead he draws out descriptive stories in slower drawls. His blister-inducing fingerpicking has transformed into a strolling strum.\nAnd while LaFargeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nasally tenor has become somewhat of a trademark, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found a singing voice like a good honey whiskeyÃ¢â‚¬â€bold\nand biting with a smooth finish.\n\nThe best tracks on Pokey LaFarge tell modern stories over top of traditional American sounds augmented by a fiddle, clarinet, muted\ntrumpet and mouth harp. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Day After DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a perfectly old-timey ditty in which LaFarge sings about the droll of working an office job.\nLater, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Close The DoorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers harsh commentary on health care reform to the tune of a minor key barkeep sing-along. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s folk songs\nlike the lovely Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Get LostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and nostalgic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Home Away From HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ however, that showcase LaFargeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knack for capturing emotion.\nConsistent and authentic throughout, Pokey LaFarge is an essential new record for anyone who appreciates old sounds.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3974b73f242633f731a61f83bc2b39c3be2441e0","amp;dn":"Pokey+LaFarge+-+Pokey+LaFarge+%282013%29+Third+Man+Records+FLAC+Beol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3974b73f242633f731a61f83bc2b39c3be2441e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,116,183,63,36,38,51,247,49,166,31,131,188,43,57,195,190,36,65,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
