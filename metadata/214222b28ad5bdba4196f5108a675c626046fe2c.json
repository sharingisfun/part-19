It is a sympathetic portrait of a flawed-hero figure fearlessly committed to the freedom of information. On December 7th, 2010, Julian Assange was arrested in London, England. He has been held in custody, charged with the sexual assault of two Swedish women. But a far bigger picture surrounds Assange.\n\nWith Julian Assange - Wikileaks: Warrior for Truth, authors Valerie Guichaoua and Sophie Radermecker present a complete portrait of this mysterious character. They have traced his steps all over the world (the United States, Australia, Iceland, the UK, Belgium, Switzerland and Sweden) gathering exclusive information and interviews on his past life, his trouble with the law, but also on WikiLeaks: how it works and the controversy surrounding it. In the process, Valerie and Sophie reveal the questionable motivations of the two Swedish women and the inconsistencies in their accusations. Julian Assange - Wikileaks: Warrior for Truth is the defence that Julian Assange himself could not have written.[/color][/size]\n\n[size=4][b][color=red]About the Authors:[/color]\nValerie Guichaoua[/b]\nValerie Guichaoua is a writer first and foremost.
