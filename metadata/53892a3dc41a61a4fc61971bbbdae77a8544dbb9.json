Features 'Stranger Candy', 'Plywood Superman' and 'Jailbird'. Luaka Bop. 2008.\n\nThe songs on this live EP came from the solo gigs. If you haven't seen Jim White live, this gives a great snapshot of what a Jim White show is like. He's quite the raconteur, and often tells strange stories between songs. When he tours solo, he uses a small array of electronic and old school gadgets (including a kid's toy keyboard), records samples of himself on the fly, then loops them and layers the loops. By the time the song is done, it often sounds like there are more than just one musician on the stage. \n\n1.Stranger Candy\n2.Jailbird\n3.Counting numbers in the air\n4.Alabama Chrome\n5.Jim3:16.Plywood superman\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53892a3dc41a61a4fc61971bbbdae77a8544dbb9","amp;dn":"Jim+White...A+Funny+Little+Cross+ar%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53892a3dc41a61a4fc61971bbbdae77a8544dbb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,137,42,61,196,26,97,164,252,97,151,27,187,218,231,122,133,68,219,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
