As Authority Drive, they feel they have perfected their brand of alternative/pop rock and are challenging themselves to bring it to the masses one person at a time. This song is a perfect sample of their sound as they bring their energy to the song without losing the feeling or trampling the holiday nature of the tune.\n\nYou can check out Authority drive at any of their websites &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Authority+Drive&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Authority+Drive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.purevolume.com/AuthorityDrive&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.purevolume.com/AuthorityDrive&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor myspace and facebook as well.\n\n\n\nMerry Christmas!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0acb3f277afff457293d279c7fe0922a0857cbe","amp;dn":"Authority+Drive+-+All+I+Want+For+Christmas+Is+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0acb3f277afff457293d279c7fe0922a0857cbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,172,179,242,119,175,255,69,114,147,210,121,199,254,9,34,160,133,124,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
