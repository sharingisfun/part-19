A former AAA game industry veteran, (Crytek, Sony, Silicon Knights), James left his job so that he could pursue his artistic ambitions. The first result of this is Ultraworld: a work intended to help define video games as an artistic medium. Yes, that sounds pretentious, but hey, don't walk away just yet. Ultraworld's story was written in a way that could only exist in this format, and none other. This could never be a book, a movie, or a play; it could only be a video game. Some people may not classify Ultraworld as such, especially those who cling to the word &quot;game&quot; in the literal sense. What's more important, though, a label, or the finished work? Wherever it lands, as long as the viewer gets something worthwhile out of it, then it doesn't matter.\n\nWarning: Ultraworld was built using CryEngine, which has several strict requirements to run.
