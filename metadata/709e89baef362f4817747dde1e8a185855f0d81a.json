I've been collecting his stuff for a few years and this is as much as I have been able to find. To me, Stompin' Tom was one of the most important figures in Canadian music. Being one of the only ones to actually sing about the country where he was from. I guarantee you'll learn more Canadian history through this mans work than any high school history class.
