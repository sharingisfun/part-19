Crowe has never attached his name to inferior product, and while Come On Down may not make anyone forget Crowe's past triumphs, it certainly holds its own when compared to the rest of the bluegrass pack. Crowe's banjo work is, as usual, of considerable interest, as is the inventive resonator guitar of Phil Leadbetter. The breadth of material here marks another strong point, moving from classic traditionals to covers of Merle Haggard, Charley Pride, and even Townes Van Zandt. Pride's ballad 'I'm So Afraid of Losing You' benefits from stately twin fiddles and Crowe's clever pedal-steel approximations, but the roaring version of Van Zandt's 'White Freightliner' might just top the list. Newcomers Greg Luck and Dwight McCall (Jim's son) ably share lead vocal duties; McCall's high tenor injects life into the harmonies, although his lead vocals tend to be overdone.\n(Marc Greilsamer)\n\n- - -\n\nJ.D.
