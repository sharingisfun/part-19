Michael Weston has received a &quot;burn notice&quot;. \n\nDumped in his hometown of Miami, Florida, he's been left in the cold with no money, no job and no information. With no job history, cash or credit, he becomes a private eye with the skills he picked up as an intelligence operative. With the help of his old friend, the drinking, womanizing Sam Axe, and his gun-running, trigger-happy ex-girlfriend Fiona, he makes people's problems go away. But when he's done, Micheal's biggest problem becomes finding out who burned him and trying to get back into the game. \n\nBurn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe is a prequel movie focusing on Sam Axe and is set before the events of Burn Notice. It tells the story of Sam's days in the Navy SEALs leading up to him going to Miami, and serves as a lead-in to the fifth season of Burn Notice.\n\n\nBrought to you by Nosnibordivx - We use the DivX &quot;Home Theatre&quot; profile","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f31b49490c285c8797394bfbaa854d7c5cba0d3","amp;dn":"Burn+Notice+-+Season+1+-+complete+-+%7BNosnibor%7D+%5BDivX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f31b49490c285c8797394bfbaa854d7c5cba0d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,49,180,148,144,194,133,200,121,115,148,191,186,168,84,215,197,203,160,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
