I don't have the other 4 episodes.\n\nAlso with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, whom John Lennon suggested run\nfor President (years later he would -- 5 times !!)\n\nThe interview with comedian Louis Nye is actually cut off.  I'm not sure\nif that's the fault of the person who recorded this show or not, but \nhe was unusually boring...so maybe that's a good thing!\n\nThis episode runs 66 minutes, since Mike Douglas had a 90 minute time slot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ec59f04c117146a35795265806672be6261626e","amp;dn":"THE+MIKE+DOUGLAS+SHOW+--+John+Lennon+and+Yoko+Ono%2C+Louis+Nye","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ec59f04c117146a35795265806672be6261626e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,197,159,4,193,23,20,106,53,121,82,101,128,102,114,190,98,97,98,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
