It is now routinely used to study biomolecular structure and dynamics particularly as a result of recent developments of a cascade of highly sophisticated multidimensional NMR pulse sequences, and of advances in genetic engineering to produce biomolecules, uniformly or selectively enriched with 13C, 15N and 2H.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a509f08d4db79654da19f5fa90aed785028f33c5","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1996%5D+NMR+Spectroscopy+and+its+Application+to+Biomedical+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a509f08d4db79654da19f5fa90aed785028f33c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,9,240,141,77,183,150,84,218,25,245,250,144,174,215,133,2,143,51,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
