After an appearance on the local scene's Bouquet of Steel compilation in 1980, Y? annexed with two members of Lips-X (guitarist Paul Nash and keyboardist Lyndon Scarfe) and changed their name to Danse Crazy. Following a recording session and a few gigs -- including one at Leeds' Futurama festival with the likes of Public Image Limited, Joy Division, and Cabaret Voltaire -- Hampshire and Patrick left. By early 1981, the remaining members became the Danse Society. The group made their recorded debut on IKF in July 1981 with the Clock single. Just prior to recording a Peel Session, they added bassist Tim Wright to the lineup. Their manager started the Pax label, which released the band's next single. A Pax EP and another Peel Session predated a defection to their own Society imprint for 1982's Seduction EP. Another single closed the year out, and by this point the Danse Society was earning the interest of several major labels. Arista won out, signing the band in early 1983. A couple singles were released before the full-length Heaven Is Waiting.  \n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 Come Inside\n02 Wake Up \n03 Angel \n04 Where Are We Now \n05 Red Light (Shine)\n06 Heaven is Waiting\n07 The Hurt\n08 2000 Light Years From Home\n09 Valiant to Vile\n10 The Night\n11 Arabia (Bonus Track)\n12 The Seduction (Bonus Track)\n13 The Theme (Bonus Track) \n14 seen the light (Bonus Track)\n15 endless (Bonus Track)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde18346dd1b80a98d7524ac4dbe75ea52dd8005","amp;dn":"Danse+Society+-+Heaven+is+Waiting+%5B1984%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cde18346dd1b80a98d7524ac4dbe75ea52dd8005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,225,131,70,221,27,128,169,141,117,36,172,77,190,117,234,82,221,128,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
