Included here are all their studio albums from 1971 to 2009 and the 1971 through 1984 albums are all the Remastered versions. Also included are the various compilations Eloy have released, the 1978 &quot;Live&quot; album, the 1985 &quot;Codename Wildgeese&quot; soundtrack, and a 1973 bootleg.\n\nAnother thing I've also thrown in is &quot;The Legacy Box&quot;, a 2 DVD set. The 1st DVD is a documentary that talks about Eloy's beginnings from 1969 to activities today. The 2nd DVD collects various videos of Eloy live.\n\nThe last thing I've thrown in is a Vinyl Rip of the 1977 &quot;Ocean&quot; album, since it's arguably their best album and my favorite from them. It's in a 24-bit + 192000Hz FLAC format, so enjoy!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 STUDIO ALBUMS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1971 - Eloy (2008 Remastered Edition)\n1973 - Inside (2000 Remastered Edition)\n1974 - Floating (2001 Remastered Edition)\n1975 - Power And The Passion (2001 Remastered Edition)\n1976 - Dawn (2004 Remastered Edition)\n1977 - Ocean (2004 Remastered Edition)\n1979 - Silent Cries And Mighty Echoes (2005 Remastered Edition)\n1980 - Colours (2005 Remastered Edition)\n1981 - Planets (2005 Remastered Edition)\n1982 - Time To Run (2005 Remastered Edition)\n1983 - Performance (2005 Remastered Edition)\n1984 - Metromania (2005 Remastered Edition)\n1988 - Ra\n1992 - Destination\n1994 - The Tides Return Forever\n1998 - Ocean 2: The Answer\n2009 - Visionary\n\nSPECIAL:\n1977 - Ocean 24-192 Vinyl Rip (FLAC)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 COMPILATIONS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1991 - Rarities\n1993 - Chronicles I\n1994 - Chronicles II\n1994 - The Best Of Eloy Vol. 1 (The Early Days 1972-1975)\n1996 - The Best Of Eloy Vol. 2 (The Prime 1976-1979)\n2003 - Timeless Passages\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 OTHER ALBUMS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1974 - Live In Minden, Germany (04-19-1973) [Bootleg]\n\n1978 - Live (2004 Remastered Edition)\n\n1985 - Codename Wildgeese (Soundtrack)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            THE LEGACY BOX (DVD SET)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDVD 1 - Mighty Echoes - The Story Of Eloy\n\nDVD 2 - Music Video Clip Collection\n\nP.S. - I found out I can't rip subtitles right, but I managed to make subtitles for the Documentary, though they're pretty amateur, so please forgive me about that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e86a5f347bc62b8450b284ae0d9494019edd09f7","amp;dn":"Eloy+-+Ultimate+Discography+%281970-2010%29+%5B%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e86a5f347bc62b8450b284ae0d9494019edd09f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,106,95,52,123,198,43,132,80,178,132,174,13,148,148,1,158,221,9,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
