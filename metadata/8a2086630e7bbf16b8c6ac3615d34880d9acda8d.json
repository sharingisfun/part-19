These birds provide meat and eggs to nourish us and feathers to keep us warm. Their quirky personalities and charming good looks make them barnyard favorites. They inspire passionate devotion from show breeders and provide a living for farmers.\n\nPresented here, breed by breed, are more than 120 barnyard fowl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from chickens and turkeys to emus and pheasants. For each animal, readers will find stunning color photography, a brief history, and a detailed description. The identifying characteristics included for each breed are: class (standard and bantam); size (for cocks and hens); appearance of comb, wattles, and earlobes; color (everything from black-breasted red to silver laced); place of origin; conservation status; and special qualities (including longevity, size and quantity of eggs, quality of meat, and other relevant uses). Author Carol Ekarius provides enough information to satisfy both the dedicated browser and the serious farmer weighing the pros and cons of multiple breeds.\n\nIn 2005, Storey's Illustrated Guide to 96 Horse Breeds of North America celebrated horses in a coffee-table reference that captivated enthusiasts of all ages. Now farmers, breeders, backyard chicken keepers, and unabashed poultry fanatics will have a definitive guide of their own. If it's poultry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ fair or fowl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it's in this book.\n\n# Paperback: 288 pages\n# Publisher: Storey Publishing, LLC; 1 edition (May 30, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1580176674\n# ISBN-13: 978-1580176675\n\n(4)\nThe Chicken Health Handbook by Gail Damerow\n\nReview:\n&quot;The editor of Rural Heritage has written a first-rate guide for the small producer interested in healthful meat and eggs as well as the exotic breed fancier raising birds for show. Having published a number of general guides to backyard poultry, including one for children, Damerow here concentrates on everything that can go wrong: diseases; problems associated with keeping birds in close quarters or caging them; litter; cannibalism; vitamin deficiency, resulting in poor molting; incubators that are too hot or too cold; predators; and the invasions of rats. She stresses that the best preventative measures involve protecting one's flock against outside influences (such as wild birds or other chickens), careful culling, and balanced nutrition. Damerow is a good writer, carefully walking the line between insulting the reader's intelligence, a flaw with many books of this sort, and giving more technical information than growers need. Her discussion of how one keeps straight which chick came from which mating--which involves the injection of food dyes into fertilized eggs, and carefully marking the webbings of feet--is downright ingenious.

This comprehensive guide, written in charming prose from the perspective of an organic farmer, will appeal to readers who are interested in raising chickens, or simply want the best knowledge about how to cook them. With this in mind, farmer and animal expert Jennifer Megyesi discusses all the basic details of raising the birdsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½general biology, health, food, choosing breeds, and so onÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and she cuts through the smoke to identify what terms like &quot;organic,&quot; &quot;free-range,&quot; and so on really mean for poultry farmers and consumers.\n\nNo chicken book would be complete without information on how to show chickens for prizes, and this is no different, but The Joy of Keeping Chickens also stresses the importance of self-sustainability and organic living, and the satisfaction of keeping heirloom breeds. Readers will appreciate the comprehensive nature of this readable, informative guide, and Megyesi's enthusiasm about keeping chickens. Coupled with Geoff Hansen's gorgeous full-color photographs, this text makes for an instant classic in the category.\n100 color photographs\n\n# Paperback: 256 pages\n# Publisher: Skyhorse Publishing (February 25, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1602393133\n# ISBN-13: 978-1602393134","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a2086630e7bbf16b8c6ac3615d34880d9acda8d","amp;dn":"On+Keeping+Chickens+%5BeBook+Pack%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a2086630e7bbf16b8c6ac3615d34880d9acda8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,32,134,99,14,123,191,22,184,198,172,54,21,211,72,128,217,172,218,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
