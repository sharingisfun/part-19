The trio wrote some of the seventies most beautifully crafted songs, merging both elements of folk and rock. Their first hit &quot;A Horse With No Name&quot; became a huge hit in 1972, soon to be followed by &quot;Sandman&quot; and &quot;I Need You&quot; all of which were on their debut top selling album &quot;America&quot;. Their second album &quot;Homecoming&quot; again became a top selling album and produced the hits &quot;Ventura Highway&quot; and &quot;Don't Cross The River&quot;. America continued to release numerous albums throughout the seventies and into the eighties. This collection gives one a good retrospective of the band's output (with only a few minor deletions) including such hits as &quot;Muskrat Love&quot;, &quot;Tin Man&quot;,&quot;Lonely People&quot;, &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot;, &quot;Daisy Jane&quot;, &quot;You Can Do\nMagic&quot; plus more . Their big hits are all here and the entire collection is beautifully remastered by Rhino Records.  If you enjoy listening to groups such as Bread, Three Dog Night, Steely Dan, The Eagles (to name just a few) then this collection will not disappoint.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.A horse with no name                                 [04:12]\n02.Sandman                                              [05:09]\n03.I need you                                           [03:07]\n04.Everyone I meet is form california                   [03:06]\n05.Ventura highway                                      [03:33]\n06.Don't cross the river                                [02:32]\n07.Only in your heart                                   [03:19]\n08.Muskrat love                                         [03:07]\n09.Another try                                          [03:19]\n10.Tin man                                              [03:28]\n11.Lonely people                                        [02:28]\n12.Sister golden hair                                   [03:16]\n13.Daisy jane                                           [03:11]\n14.Woman tonight                                        [02:24]\n15.Today's the day                                      [03:17]\n16.Amber cascades                                       [02:54]\n17.California dreamin'                                  [02:47]\n18.You can do magic                                     [03:53]\n19.Right before your eyes                               [03:54]\n20.The border                                           [04:02]\n21.World of light                                       [04:50]\n22.Paradise                                             [03:39]\n____\n\n75:27 min\n107,8 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
