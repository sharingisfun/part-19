He finds out many surprising truths.\n\nA notorious murdererÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s last words before execution are a request to have the soybean soup he had before his arrest. In the same way the reporter tried to uncover the meaning of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRosebudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Citizen Kane, a broadcast producer starts tracing the secret of the soup. Behind the captivating taste lies a womanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s unfortunate life and love story.\nIt has been twelve years since Lee Seogoon made his last film, Rub Love, and here the director wonderfully mixes two different genres-the thriller and the love story. The English title, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe RecipeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ contains a lot of meaning: a record of a personÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s life, a memory of taste, an experience of loss and a chronicle of hurts. In this sense, the film is a recipe for everything. With his original touch, Lee illustrates the obsession with unforgettable memories of love and a fatalistic point of view. The soybean soup recipe contains pain, longing and salvation. In a sense, the recipe is the very history of KoreaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s memory and tradition.
