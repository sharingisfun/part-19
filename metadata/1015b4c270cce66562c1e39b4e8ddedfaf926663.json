I have also included the opener separately, for those who want to view it. Finally I created file names that reflect what each episode is about, since the actual episode titles mostly did not remind me of which episode was which. I have included a word.doc that has the episode list from Wikipedia, for reference to the actual episode titles.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia:\n\n&quot;The show centres on Jaye Tyler (Caroline Dhavernas), a recent Brown University graduate with a philosophy degree, who holds a dead-end job as a sales clerk at a Niagara Falls gift shop. Jaye is the reluctant participant in conversations with various animal figurines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a wax lion, brass monkey, stuffed bear, and mounted fish, among others ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which direct her via oblique instructions to help people in need.\n\nSome sources use the two-word spelling, &quot;Wonder Falls&quot;, for the title. The title of its theme song, &quot;I Wonder Why the Wonderfalls&quot; by Andy Partridge of XTC fame, lists the single word spelling in its original release on iTunes.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1015b4c270cce66562c1e39b4e8ddedfaf926663","amp;dn":"Wonderfalls+%28complete+series+-+2004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1015b4c270cce66562c1e39b4e8ddedfaf926663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,21,180,194,112,204,230,101,98,193,227,155,78,141,222,223,175,146,102,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
