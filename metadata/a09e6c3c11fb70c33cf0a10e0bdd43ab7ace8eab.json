The current\nmembers of Bardo Pond are Michael Gibbons, John Gibbons, Isobel Sollenberger,\nClint Takeda, and Ed Farnsworth. Bardo Pond&amp;#039;s drug-inspired music is often\nclassified as space rock, post-rock, or psychedelic rock. Many Bardo Pond album\ntitles have been derived from the names of esoteric psychedelic substances.\n\nAllmusic describes Bardo Pond as having &quot;lengthy, deliberate sound explorations\nfilled with all the hallmarks of modern-day space rock: droning guitars, thick\ndistortion, feedback, reverb, and washes of white noise.&quot; Bardo Pond is a\ntaper-friendly band that encourages fans to make recordings of their shows.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a09e6c3c11fb70c33cf0a10e0bdd43ab7ace8eab","amp;dn":"Bardo+Pond+-+Ticket+Crystals+-+COMPLETE+PACK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a09e6c3c11fb70c33cf0a10e0bdd43ab7ace8eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,158,108,60,17,251,112,195,60,240,161,14,11,221,67,171,122,206,142,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
