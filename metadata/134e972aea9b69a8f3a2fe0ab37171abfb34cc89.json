Together with a few later sessions, they feature in this centenary retrospective â€“ the only omission being Paul Zukowskyâ€™s pioneering account of the Duo for violin and piano, replaced with James Levineâ€™s first rendition of the Variations, which has great impact but also a portentousness not evident elsewhere.\r\n\r\nCentral to these performances is Paul Jacobs, who, with Charles Rosen, confirmed that Carterâ€™s piano-writing has an expressive eloquence to match its intellectual brilliance. Listening to his command of rhetoric in the Piano Sonata, Carterâ€™s first (untypical) masterpiece, or the incisive interplay with Joel Krosnick in the Cello Sonata, which marks a new departure, is to be reminded of his unstinting advocacy. As a harpsichordist, Jacobs is unfailingly lucid in the deft play on Baroque stylisms of the Sonata for flute, oboe, cello and harpsichord; and his partnership with Gilbert Kalish in the epic Double Concerto brings a tensile energy yet to be equalled â€“ for all that the stereophonic placing now feels a little too extreme. Other pianists have found greater poise in Night Fantasies, but none has exceeded Jacobsâ€™s grasp of its stream-of-consciousness intensity. Nor has the Composers Quartet been outdone in making the magisterial First Quartet so inclusive an experience, though the vehemence of its successor undersells the musicâ€™s acerbic humour.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, Jan DeGaetani pertly characterises the early settings of Robert Frost, and Gerard Schwarz brings warmth to the Copland-like Elegy and suggests that The Minotaur ballet is not so indebted to Stravinsky as is often assumed. Oliver Knussen gives notice of a fervent advocacy in the song-cycle In Sleep, In Thunder, but Martyn Hill is too elegant to convey the violent contrasts of Robert Lowellâ€™s verse, whereas The Fires of London tend towards the heavy-handed in the scintillating Triple Duo. Their inclusion is still welcome, and the quality of remastering, annotations and presentation does the project justice. Carter devotees will find this a mandatory purchase","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134e972aea9b69a8f3a2fe0ab37171abfb34cc89","amp;dn":"Carter+-+A+Nonesuch+Retrospective+%284CD+Box+Set%29+%7BNonesuch%7D+%282009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134e972aea9b69a8f3a2fe0ab37171abfb34cc89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,78,151,42,234,155,105,168,243,162,254,10,179,113,113,171,251,52,204,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
