If they can be successfully integrated into the wild, they could become the forerunners of an audacious plan to help save the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s population of wild tigers.\n\nFollow the journey from cuddly cub to professional assassin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all captured on film and video ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as the youngstersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ feral instincts slowly emerge in the African wilderness. Instinctively, all cats will stalk. However, it is the killing technique that must be learned by watching their mothers. Without their parentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guiding example, the cubs clumsily cut their teeth on large antelope ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ often holding on for dear life.\n\nMore fascinating than gruesome, the drama of life and death unfolds in amazing detail. A handheld camera hovers inches from JulieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jaws as she prowls, while a clever, head-mounted surveillance camera captures RonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s point of view as he closes in for the kill ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the very first POV images ever recorded from a large predator while hunting. It is a documentary unlike any other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an intimate, step-by-step look at the transition of two zoo-born tigers into the wild as they struggle to become independent and self-sufficient, while serving as pioneers for captive tigers everywhere.\n\n\nMore information: http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tigers/tigers\n\n\nSEE ALSO - Tiger: Spy in the Jungle (BBC, 2008):\n2.04 GiB - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4531939/Tiger__Spy_in_the_Jungle\n4.37 GiB - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4717199/BBC.Tiger.Spy.In.The.Jungle.Complete.Series.720p.HDTV.x264","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54790d8c1544fc0eecd394f0c9c35c62f83f793","amp;dn":"Living+with+Tigers+%28Discovery%2C+2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c54790d8c1544fc0eecd394f0c9c35c62f83f793","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,71,144,216,193,84,79,192,238,205,57,79,12,156,53,198,47,131,247,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
