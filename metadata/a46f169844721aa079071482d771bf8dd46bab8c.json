Full of insights that will prove useful at work, at home, with friends, and just about everywhere else, the book will help readers become tactful schmoozers who can defuse situational tensions and lubricate personal, social, workplace, and political interactions with others.\n\nThe book is organized around five occasions: schmoozing in social interactions, family schmoozing, schmoozing in the workplace, schmoozing in education, and schmoozing in cross-cultural interactions. Examples of both successful and failed schmoozing are drawn from television, films, news, and everyday life. Hundreds of real-world verbal interactions illustrate how recapturing this lost art can lead to increased harmony in all spheres of life.\n\n&quot;What a nice surprise to find a book that really looks at engaging in casual chat schmoozing and how it can enhance our sense of happiness and belonging in social life, as well as our actual success at various endeavors. Boxer explores the impact of good schmoozing on making friends, improving relationships with family members, getting ahead at school or work, and understanding our fellow citizens. This book is replete with examples of schmoozing and provides interpretations as to their contribution to the conversation.&quot; \n\nFebruary 2011\nPublisher: ABC-CLIO, Incorporated\nFormat: Hardcover 203pp \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a46f169844721aa079071482d771bf8dd46bab8c","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Art+of+the+Good+Schmooze","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a46f169844721aa079071482d771bf8dd46bab8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,111,22,152,68,114,26,160,121,7,20,130,215,113,191,141,212,107,171,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
