This salty brotherhood from Canada's most unique region faces swells as high as houses and icebergs the size of small cities as they fish for riches hundreds of miles offshore in the North Atlantic. It's a tough job - tough on boats, tough on gear, tough on the human body - but these bred-in-the-bone fishermen wouldn't have it any other way. \n\n\n------------\n\n\nI will be out of town from April 22 thru early May.\nIf no one caps this show in my absence, I will still do episodes 9 and 10 when I get home (2nd week of May). \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0356fefe6f2402ff022c9916439befa12b43621c","amp;dn":"Cold.Water.Cowboys.S01E08.Band.of.Brothers.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0356fefe6f2402ff022c9916439befa12b43621c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,86,254,254,111,36,2,255,2,44,153,22,67,155,239,161,43,67,98,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
