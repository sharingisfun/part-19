This new Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics edition brings together a dozen of the master's tales-from his early short stories &quot;Under the Pyramids&quot; (originally ghostwritten for Harry Houdini) and &quot;The Music of Erich Zann&quot; (which Lovecraft ranked second among his own favorites) through his more fully developed works, &quot;The Dunwich Horror,&quot; The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, and At the Mountains of Madness.\n\nThe Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories presents the definitive corrected texts of these works, along with Lovecraft critic and biographer S. T. Joshi's illuminating introduction and notes to each story.\n\nEPUB AND MOBI.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8acfcb505bf2547558df0cba61a7d8758ce447a5","amp;dn":"The+Thing+On+The+Doorstep+And+Other+Weird+Stories+By+H.+P.+Lovec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8acfcb505bf2547558df0cba61a7d8758ce447a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,207,203,80,91,242,84,117,88,223,12,186,97,167,216,117,140,228,71,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
