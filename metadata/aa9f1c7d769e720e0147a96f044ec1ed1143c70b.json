I am very cautious when upgrading and only do so every few years. After careful testing I am confident that upgrading to Quicken 2015 did not damage my Quicken 2011 data. I did find that reports that search for memo strings run much slower. Also, 1 out of about 50 custom reports did not preserve its settings so you might want to check for problems in your custom reports after upgrading. I do not use the bank transaction downloading features so cannot comment on whether they still work in this version. Only one version of Quicken can be installed on a system so it is handy to have a 2nd computer running your old version of Quicken to compare against.\n\nInstallation procedure:\n\n1) Unzip to temporary folder.\n\n2) Run install.exe.\n\n3) You may be prompted to reboot Windows after the installation completes.\n\n4) You will be prompted to create an Intuit ID (or enter an existing Intuit ID) the first time Quicken is run. Effective beginning with Quicken 2015, an Intuit ID is required to run (and update) the application. When creating an Intuit ID you will be asked for personal information however any data, including nonsense, can be entered. A valid email address is required.\n\n5) If you want to avoid registering, run Quicken, hold down the Ctrl + Shift keys and select One Step Update from the Tools menu. You will see the message &quot;You will no longer be prompted for registration.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa9f1c7d769e720e0147a96f044ec1ed1143c70b","amp;dn":"Quicken+2015+Canadian+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa9f1c7d769e720e0147a96f044ec1ed1143c70b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,159,28,125,118,158,114,14,1,71,169,111,4,78,193,237,17,67,199,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
