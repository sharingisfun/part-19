The airline operates a fleet of Avro RJ aircraft and Airbus A319s on European routes.\n\n\nThis program focuses on the airline's African operation which is serviced with a fleet of Airbus A330-300s operated by Birdy Airlines.\n\n\nThe dvd takes you on 2 round trip flights from Brussels to Africa. First we fly to Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast, later we visit Senegal and Gambia. During the flights you will get a presentation of the cockpit, you will also follow the pre-departure briefings, get route information, follow the arrival briefings, aircraft walkaround and hear communications with Air Traffic Control including &quot;blind transmissions&quot; over Africa and last, but not least, a detailed cabin presentation and look at the excellent inflight service provided by SN.\n\n\nFlight Information:\n\nFLIGHT#   ROUTE          A/C TYPE   REGISTR   FLT TIME    PIC'S NAME\nSN207     BRU-FNA-ABJ    A330-300   OO-SFN    6h20/1h29   Capt.
