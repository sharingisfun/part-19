The course of his life is clearÃ¢â‚¬â€he will be an apprentice, a mage, and then a superior. But a tragic accident finds him wielding a god-like power over life and death, and as rumors of mage war grow stronger around him, he learns his future is not fated to be as simple as he dreamed. Glamour of the God-Touched follows Garrick as he discovers the forces behind his new magic. The lessons he learns and how he deals with them will threaten the very nature of who he is. \n\n\n2) Trail of the Torean\nCursed magic from the gods. \nA mysterious underground city. \nThe first steps toward open war. \nGarrick is determined to be rid of a devastating magic that threatens to take over his life. Together with DarienÃ¢â‚¬â€the son of a military manÃ¢â‚¬â€he accepts a quest for a commission that promises enough to pay for the sorcery he'll need to break that magic's hold. Along the way he faces powerful forces as ancient as the plane itself, encounters the beautiful leader of a sect of freedom-minded, independent mages, and finds himself in the crossfire of a Lectodinian and Koradictine gambit against the most powerful Torean mage in the region. \nTrail of the Torean follows Garrick as he lives with his treacherous new magic, discovers exactly how deep his connection to the god-like planewalkers might be, and finds that the very future of magic across the entire plane of Adruin hangs in the balance.\n\n\n3) Target Of The Orders\nA god-touched mage. \nA headstrong rebel. \nMagewar to the west. \nAll Garrick wants is to be left alone. But when he and Darien return to Caledena, they find the mage orders have taken control, and that those same orders want GarrickÃ¢â‚¬â€dead or alive. The orders have begun their war, and Garrick may be the only mage who can keep them from victory. \nTarget of the Orders finds Garrick hunted by Elman, an ambitious Lectodinian mage, and by Sunathri, the beautiful leader of the newly formed independent Torean House. But Garrick has bigger problems than these. To survive, he will have to control the dark magic inside him and suffer the twisted politics of the god-like planewalker who is using Garrick for his own purpose. When Garrick discovers the depths of the planewalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s designs, he realizes there is more at stake than simply controlling the plane. \nCan Garrick survive his own magic? Can he survive powers greater than he can conceive? Is he free to choose? \n\n\n4) Gathering Of The God-Touched\nA legendary mountain. \nThree mages of otherworldly power. \nA clash that will change the world. \nGarrick is a young mage inflicted with a chaotic magic tied to a powerful planewalker. He has never wanted anything more than to live his life in peace. The fact of his god-touched power, however, means the two powerful orders that control magic across Adruin will not rest until he is dead. Tired of running, Garrick decides to face his destiny in direct contests with the ordersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ god-touched mages. Darien, the son of DorfortÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commander, and Sunathri, the leader of a faction of independent mages, understand that the freedom of the entire plane is at stake, so they lend him their blades in support. \nTo succeed, they will have to use Garrick as bait, convince the leaders of Dorfort to join them, and face the horrors of war against the overwhelming strength of the ordersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ armies as they convene their forces at the shadows of the legendary GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tower. \nGathering of the God-Touched follows Garrick as he faces the repercussions of his magic, and grows to understand what it means to have a place in the world. Along the way, he discovers the planeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimate destiny may well lie in places far more exotic than anyone could expect\n\n\n5) Pawn Of The Planewalker\nA god-touched vigilante. \nPowerful rivalries. \nA desperate plan. \nAfter a hollow victory at GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tower, Garrick seeks vengeance from mages who have wronged him. But a call from Darien brings him back to Dorfort, and the machinations of his god-like superior take him to Rastella, a cold and distant plane that is ruled by a man who has stolen control of the planeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magic. All the while, the remaining mages of the Koradictine order, thought to be devastated after the battle at GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tower, hatch a breathtaking plan to reclaim their glory. \nPawn of the Planewalker follows Garrick as he discovers the vastness of Existence. Can Garrick save magic in Rastella? Will doing so create greater disturbance elsewhere? Can he return to his own plane in time to save those he loves? And, finally, what part must Garrick play in the schemes of the planewalker who controls the very power that drives him? \nThe answers to these questions will define the course of history.\n\n\n6) Changing Of The Guard\nA desolate plane. \nA devastated order of mages. \nA planewalker hungry for revenge. \nGarrick has agreed to lead the independent Torean mages, if for no other reason than to protect them from deceit and trickery of the god-like planewalkers. But when he returns to Dorfort, he finds the high superior of the Koradictine order has kidnapped Will, the boy Garrick had taken under wing. Devastated, he vows to retrieve the boy, a choice that results in being disowned by the twisted planewalker who is his mage superior. Meanwhile, the Lectodinian order launches a winter offensive designed to gain control of magic across Adruin, and the remnants of the Koradictine leadership joust for position as they enact a desperate ploy to survive. \nIn Changing of the Guard, Garrick is on his own as he hunts the Koradictine high superior through a trail that leads through demonic underplanes and mystical time warps. Can he survive the planes without his superiorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aid? Can he save the boy? And perhaps more important, what will remain of the orders if he survives? \nThe results will change the face of Adruin forever.\n\n\n7) Lord Of The Freeborn\nTorean treachery. \nA planewalker's fury. \nA city under siege. \nGarrick wants to bring purpose to his Freeborn mages so he can use them to protect the plane from the whims of the god-like planewalkers. After the city of Dorfort evicts the Freeborn, however, his first task is to find them a new home. The Freeborn are a flighty collection, though, filled with fiercely independent and opinionated members as well as those who are not above treachery to get their way. Unknown to Garrick, a renegade Koradictine mage who has her own ties to the planewalkers is making her last-gasp effort to remain in power. And this time Garrick himself is the target. \nWhen the Koradictine arrives in Dorfort she unleashes an evening of terror the city has never before seen. \nIn Lord of the Freeborn, Garrick must fight for the survival of his order, fight for his friends, and fight to save himself. Does he have what it takes to survive a planewalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full fury? Can he save Adruin from annihilation? Will he live to face the truth of his full destiny?\n\n\n8) Lords Of Existence\nUltimate power. \nTreachery. \nA battlefield of pure magic. \nGarrick has destroyed a god-like planewalker, and now finds himself shunned by his superior and marked for death by the Lords of Existence. He also discovers his powers have grown to monstrous proportions, and realizes that if he loses control now he may well destroy all life in Dorfort, and perhaps even across the entire plane of Adruin. As Garrick retreats to a sanctuary deep inside the ruins of the underground city of Arderveer, the Lectodinian order seizes the opportunity to unleash their plans to storm the plane. Meanwhile, the ruling powers of Existence decide that the easiest way to punish Garrick is to exterminate Adruin. \nIn Lords of Existence Garrick confronts his own humanity, his banished superior, and human leaders who refuse to see the truth as he takes his fight against the planewalkers all the way into the world of All of Existence itself. \nTo win he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice, and every life in Adruin hangs in the balance.\n\n\n\nIs this torrent dead?
