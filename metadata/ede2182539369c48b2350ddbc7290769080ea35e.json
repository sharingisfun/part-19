In 1991, Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) was an American soldier serving\nin the Persian Gulf when he was shot in the head; pronounced dead by a field\nsurgeon, Starks somehow returned to life, though with no small number of\npsychological problems to show for his troubles. A year later, Starks is\nwalking through the snowy Vermont wilderness when he discovers a woman whose\ntruck has broken down, Jean (Kelly Lynch). Starks tries to help Jean and her\nyoung daughter, and later flags down a car for a ride into town; however, the\ncar is being driven by a criminal on the run from the police (Brad Renfro),\nand not long after the car is cornered by police, Starks' memory goes blank.\nWhen he comes to, Jack is accused of killing a patrolman in the violent\nstandoff that followed, and is told that the woman, her daughter, and the\ncriminal existed only in his imagination. Declared insane in his murder\ntrial, Starks is sentenced to a mental institution run by Dr. Becker\n(Kris Kristofferson), who seems to believe that the more brutal the treatment\nthe better. As Starks suffers frequent beatings and long spells in a frozen\nlocker, his mind drifts from his harrowing past into the future, where he\nvisits with Jackie (Keira Knightley), who once was the young girl Starks\ntried to help. The Jacket also features Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dr. Lorenson\na compassionate doctor who tries to help Starks and his fellow patients.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Adrien Brody.\n=&gt;-Keira Knightley.\n=&gt;-Daniel Craig.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-John Maybury.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Mystery : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2005.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.30 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 817 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 42mn.\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.500.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 512.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1700 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 219 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ede2182539369c48b2350ddbc7290769080ea35e","amp;dn":"The+Jacket+-+Sci-Fi+Mystery+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ede2182539369c48b2350ddbc7290769080ea35e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,226,24,37,57,54,156,72,178,53,13,219,199,41,7,105,8,14,163,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
