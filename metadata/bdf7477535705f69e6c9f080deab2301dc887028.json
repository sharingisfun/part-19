Black box logging gives you the freedom to log data under all circumstances without a laptop computer in the vehicle. Wide band O2, 5V analog voltage and thermocouple inputs allow you to integrate data from most external sensors directly with EFILiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s logged data stream.\n\nSpecialty DVT controls such as Crank Angle Sensor Error relearn (CASE), cylinder power balance test and manual idle control are all available in the EFILive Scan Tool. With DVT controls you also manually control functions in real time such as turning cooling fans on/off, control fuel pressure and many other functions.\n\nView logged data real time, or play back recorded logs at a later stage. To assist in data analysis, data can be displayed in many forms ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ virtual dashboard, charts, tables, and 3D surface maps. Create a visual cue that helps you diagnose faults at a single glance.\n\nHighly regarded as the premier Scan Tool for late model GM based Gas and Diesel vehicles, the EFILive Scan Tool is the one tool your tool box cannot be without.
