It&amp;#039;s a South-African musical, sort of a mix of all the popular music styles of the era.\n\nIt was the first black South-African musical to ever reach an international audience, and did much for the anti-apartheid movement.\n\nIf anyone has any higher-quality rips of this, please let me know - I have so far not been able to find a CD version of this musical. Please rip it if you have it!\n\nThis was ripped from the LP Galaxy GAL 6001, using some mediocre equipment.\n\nRipped and edited with Audacity, encoded to FLAC using flac 1.1.2 on a Debian computer.\n\nInfo:\n-------------------------------------------------------\nAll music written by BERTHA EGNOS\n\nLyrics by GAIL LAIKER\n\nVocal arrangements by BERTHA EGNOS\n\nProduced by BILLY FORREST &amp; LOFTY SCHULTZ\n\nArranged by LOFTY SCHULTZ\n\nRecorded at GALLO (Africa) &amp; MvN Studios, Johannesburg\n\nEngineers: JOHN LINDEMAN / PETER THWAITES\n           PAUL WRIGHT / PETER CERONIO\n\nMastering: SATBEL Music Recording Studios, Johannesburg\n           GALLO (Africa) Studios, Johannesburg\n\nEngineers: ALLAN GOLDBERG / PETER THWAITES\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease enjoy and share.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:250769e51cab61c9be2bc782407464a5eb9f3fa8","amp;dn":"Ipi+Tombi+-+Music+from+the+Stage+Production","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"250769e51cab61c9be2bc782407464a5eb9f3fa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,7,105,229,28,171,97,201,190,43,199,130,64,116,100,165,235,159,63,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
