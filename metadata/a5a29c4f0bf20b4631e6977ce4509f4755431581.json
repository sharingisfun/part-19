Degrees, radians and grads are supported, indicated by DEG, RAD, GRAD in the display. Use the DRG key to change mode.\n* If any of the digit keys are disabled, or the decimal point doesn't work, or you have answers with letters in, or basic arithmetic appears to be wrong, then you are in binary, octal or hexadecimal mode. Press DEC to return to decimal operation. If you don't need these modes, please make sure that 'Enable Radix Modes' is disabled in the settings.\n* If you can't find HEX, BIN or OCT modes, go to the settings and make sure that 'Enable Radix Modes' is checked.\nPlease read the help for more information.\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nInstall the apk,\nEnjoy and seed.\n\n\nDon't forget to seed.If you like this then support the developers by buying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a29c4f0bf20b4631e6977ce4509f4755431581","amp;dn":"RealCalc+Plus+v1.7.4+apk+android+%7Bms5d%7D+%5BAMRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a29c4f0bf20b4631e6977ce4509f4755431581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,162,156,79,11,242,11,70,49,230,151,124,228,80,159,71,85,67,21,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
