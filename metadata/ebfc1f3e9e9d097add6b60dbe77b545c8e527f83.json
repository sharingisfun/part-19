It enables you to store data from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents, such as images and music, directly within the database. SQL Server 2008 delivers a rich set of integrated services that enable you to do more with your data such as query, search, synchronize, report, and analyze. Your data can be stored and accessed in your largest servers within the data center all the way down to desktops and mobile devices, enabling you to have control over your data no matter where it is stored. \n\nSQL Server 2008 enables you to consume your data within custom applications developed using Microsoft .NET and Visual Studio and within your service-oriented architecture (SOA) and business process through Microsoft BizTalk Server while information workers can access data directly in the tools they use every day, such as the 2007 Microsoft Office system. SQL Server 2008 delivers a trusted, productive, and intelligent data platform for all your data needs.\n\n\nSQL Server 2008 New Features\n\n\nTRUSTED\nSQL Server provides the highest levels of security, reliability, and scalability for your business-critical applications.\n\n   \n\nProtect valuable information\n\nTransparent Data Encryption \nEnable encryption of an entire database, data files, or log files, without the need for application changes. Benefits of this include: Search encrypted data using both range and fuzzy searches, search secure data from unauthorized users, and data encryption without any required changes in existing applications.\n\n\nExtensible Key Management \nSQL Server 2005 provides a comprehensive solution for encryption and key management. SQL Server 2008 delivers an excellent solution to this growing need by supporting third-party key management and HSM products.\n\n\nAuditing \nCreate and manage auditing via DDL, while simplifying compliance by providing more comprehensive data auditing. This enables organizations to answer common questions, such as, &quot;What data was retrieved?&quot; \n \n \n\n   \n\n Ensure business continuity\n\nEnhanced Database Mirroring\nSQL Server 2008 builds on SQL Server 2005 by providing a more reliable platform that has enhanced database mirroring, including automatic page repair, improved performance, and enhanced supportability. \n\n\nAutomatic Recovery of Data Pages\nSQL Server 2008 enables the principal and mirror machines to transparently recover from 823/824 types of data page errors by requesting a fresh copy of the suspect page from the mirroring partner transparently to end users and applications. \n\n\nLog Stream Compression\nDatabase mirroring requires data transmissions between the participants of the mirroring implementations. With SQL Server 2008, compression of the outgoing log stream between the participants delivers optimal performance and minimizes the network bandwidth used by database mirroring.\n \n \n\n   \n\n Enable predictable response\n\n\nResource Governor\nProvide a consistent and predictable response to end users with the introduction of Resource Governor, allowing organizations to define resource limits and priorities for different workloads, which enable concurrent workloads to provide consistent performance to their end users. \n\n\nPredictable Query Performance\nEnable greater query performance stability and predictability by providing functionality to lock down query plans, enabling organizations to promote stable query plans across hardware server replacements, server upgrades, and production deployments. \n\n\nData Compression\nEnable data to be stored more effectively, and reduce the storage requirements for your data. Data compression also provides significant performance improvements for large I/O bound workloads, like data warehousing.\n\n\nHot Add CPU\nDynamically scale a database on demand by allowing CPU resources to be added to SQL Server 2008 on supported hardware platforms without forcing any downtime on applications. Note that SQL Server already supports the ability to add memory resources online. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebfc1f3e9e9d097add6b60dbe77b545c8e527f83","amp;dn":"Microsoft+SQL+Server+2008+Enterprise+++Release+Candidate+0+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebfc1f3e9e9d097add6b60dbe77b545c8e527f83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,252,31,62,158,157,9,122,221,107,96,219,231,123,84,92,142,82,127,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
