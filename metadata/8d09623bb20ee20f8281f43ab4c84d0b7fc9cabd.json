All are improved pdf versions of files available elsewhere. These new versions have some defects but are much more readable than the source files.\n\nAll are clearscan pdf files with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\n1. Law, Love and Language (Sheed &amp; Ward, 1968). (Contains quite a lot of underlining.)\n\ndescription:\n\nWhat is ethics all about? In this book Herbert McCabe suggests that it is about loving, obeying laws and talking to people. In doing so, he offers an introduction to ethical thinking for anyone with a serious interest in moral philosophy. He does so as someone who writes with a Christian audience in mind. Most of his arguments, however, do not presuppose a believing Christian readership.\n\n\n2. On Aquinas (Continuum, 2008). \n\ndescription: The revival of interest in Aquinas has run simultaneously with the rise of interest in Aristotle, on whose philosophy Aquinas based his own. On Aquinas is a masterly work of exposition written with breathtaking clarity. By the use of simple modern analogy Mccabe brings Aquinas's thought to life and underlines the crucial influence of Aquinas on our own contemporary thought. It is rare to find a work of philosophical exposition which is exciting to read. Even those who are unfamiliar with Aquinas will find this book gripping. Published posthumously, this study is thoroughly rewarding and will increase McCabe's reputation as one of Britain's finest theologians of recent years.\n\n\n3. The Good Life: Ethics and the Pursuit of Happiness (Continuum, 2005). (Pp. x-xi missing from the scan.)\n\ndescription:\n\nThe Dalai Lama once wrote that the object of human existence was to be happy. This sounds extremely glib as happiness in the popular imagination is a feeling and in the words of the song 'the greatest gift that we possess'. On the other hand, von Hugel wrote 'Religion has never made me happy;it's no use shutting your eyes to the fact that the deeper you go, the more alone you will find yourself' This small masterpiece by the late Fr Herbert McCabe of the Dominican order steers a steady courss between these two extremes. We feels instinctively that human beings are designed to enjoy themselves and to be happy and yet we are told that suffering is good for the soul. But in the Catholic tradition the true object of human existence is the vision of God and nothing less than this will ever make us truly happy. But Fr McCabe explores much deeper issues. Is Happiness a pleasure or a pain? You hardly know. Certainly it is not a comfort for comfort spells seciurity and hapiness can take you out of yourself to a degree where all secutiry is left behind. Behind a feeling of exultation, you can sense the flame of incandescent terror. This short book is entirely original and will further enhance McCabe's posthumous reputation.\n\n\n4. Faith Within Reason (Continuum, 2007).\n\ndescription:\n\nIs it possible to think about religious beliefs philosophically?  Should religious beliefs be viewed as a flight from reason or as capable of rational support?  Can theologians learn from philosophers?  Can philosophers learn from theologians? Is it possible to be both a good Christian and a good thinker?  Can there be such a thing as reasonable faith?\n\nThis book is chiefly concerned with these questions and others related to them.  A collection of previously unpublished papers written by the late Herbert McCabe O.P., it examines the nature of religious belief, especially belief in God, with an eye on both theological and philosophical arguments.  Some thinkers have sought to drive a wedge between philosophy and theology.  Like Thomas Aquinas, whose writings he especially admired, McCabe seeks to show how the two can be systematically connected.  Some religious truths, he argues, may defy our understanding.  But this does not mean that they cannot be reasonably discussed.\n\nexcerpt:\n\n&quot;Sin is something that changes God into a projection of our guilt, so that we don't see the real God at all; all we see is some kind of judge. God (the whole meaning and purpose and point of our existence) has become a condemnation of us. God has been turned into Satan, the accuser of man, the paymaster, the one who weighs our deeds and condemns usÃ¢â‚¬Â¦It is very odd that so much casual Christian thinking should be worship of Satan, that we should think of the punitive satanic God as the only God available to the sinner. It is very odd that the view of God as seen from the church should ever be simply the view of God as seen from hell. For damnation must be just being fixed in this illusion, stuck forever with the God of the Law, stuck forever with the God provided by our sin.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d09623bb20ee20f8281f43ab4c84d0b7fc9cabd","amp;dn":"Herbert+McCabe+-+Thomist+philosopher-theologian+%284+books%29+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d09623bb20ee20f8281f43ab4c84d0b7fc9cabd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,9,98,59,178,14,226,15,130,129,244,58,180,200,77,11,127,201,202,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
