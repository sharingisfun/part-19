It was released during the early Britpop era with far less critical interest than their highly successful second album Moseley Shoals. Ocean Colour Scene themselves largely ignore this album, feeling that the band and label's conflicting musical views led to a 'watered-down' debut which lacked the edge of the band's live popularity.The first single from the album was &quot;Sway&quot; in February 1992, followed by &quot;Giving it All Away&quot; in March and finally &quot;Do Yourself a Favour&quot; in May.\n\n Track listing\n\n1.&quot;Talk On&quot;\n2.&quot;How About You&quot;\n3.&quot;Giving it All Away&quot;\n4.&quot;Justine&quot;\n5.&quot;Do Yourself A Favour&quot;\n6.&quot;Third Shade of Green&quot;\n7.&quot;Sway&quot;\n8.&quot;Penny Pinching Rainy Heaven Days&quot;\n9.&quot;One of Those Days&quot;\n10.&quot;Is She Coming Home&quot;\n11.&quot;Blue Deep Ocean&quot;\n12.&quot;Reprise&quot;\n\n\n320 kbs \n\n\nThank you for seeding  :o)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1213a9ed7daaf3b86fd68e35c31584afc14015d4","amp;dn":"Ocean+Colour+Scene+-+Ocean+Colour+Scene+1992","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1213a9ed7daaf3b86fd68e35c31584afc14015d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,19,169,237,125,170,243,184,111,214,142,53,195,21,132,175,193,64,21,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
