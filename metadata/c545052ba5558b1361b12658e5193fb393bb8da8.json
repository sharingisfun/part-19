Though it was originally slated to be a special Gangsta Grillz edition mixtape with DJ Drama, Game made an 11th-hour switch and went back to his playa potna DJ Skee, who has been a part of several Game mixtapes over the years.\n\nSkee contributed production to the mixtape as well, making a &quot;Skeemix&quot; of the Compton native's controversial &quot;400 Bars.&quot; Travis Barker lends his drums to a remix of the Cool and Dre-produced &quot;Shake.&quot;\n\nGame has no shortage of fire power elsewhere in the mixtape. Diddy appears on &quot;Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; and Nipsey Hussle raps on the freestyle &quot;Ha Ha,&quot; which uses Fat Joe's &quot;Slow Down&quot; beat. Lil Wayne, Jadakiss, The Birdman, Jim Jones, Hurricane Chris and Bizzy Bone all appear. Game also introduces new talent such as Kanary Diamonds and Maad Maxx.\n\nThe Red Album comes out on June 15 and features guest spots from Dr. Dre and Justin Timberlake.\n\nThe Red Room track listing, according to Game's Camp:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;400 Bars (Skeemix)&quot;\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Ha Ha,&quot; featuring Nipsey Hussle\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;The Professionals,&quot; featuring Menace, Maad Maxx, Kanary Diamonds\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â»&quot;Revolver or the Semi,&quot; featuring Mysonne\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â»&quot;Drop the World,&quot; featuring Kanary Diamonds\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â»&quot;Never Stop Hustlin', &quot; featuring Fabolous\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â»&quot;Real Gangstas,&quot; featuring Hurricane Chris and Bizzy Bone\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Gangs of New York,&quot; featuring Jadakiss and Jim Jones\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Trippin', &quot; featuring Kanary Diamonds\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Everything Red,&quot; featuring Lil Wayne and Birdman\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;First Lady,&quot; featuring Kanary Diamonds\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Lowrider,&quot; featuring Busta Rhymes\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;It Must Be Me,&quot; featuring Pharrell\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Maad Maxxx Freestyle&quot;\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Dopeman,&quot; featuring XO\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Diamonds,&quot; featuring K-Young\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; featuring Diddy\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Slangin Rocks&quot;\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» &quot;Shake&quot; (TRV$ Remix)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Bonus Track: &quot;Over,&quot; featuring Juice &amp; Mysonne","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c545052ba5558b1361b12658e5193fb393bb8da8","amp;dn":"The.Game.The.Red.Room.%5Bmixtape+2010%5D.X0.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c545052ba5558b1361b12658e5193fb393bb8da8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,69,5,43,165,85,139,19,97,177,38,88,229,25,63,179,147,187,141,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
