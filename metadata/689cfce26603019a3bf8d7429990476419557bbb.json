It has the \nworld's fourth-largest blogging community and worst record for road deaths.\n\nIn Tehran, Rageh visits people's homes and travels through a rich variety of \nneighbourhoods in a bid to get to the heart of what he describes as one of the most \nmisunderstood countries in the world. As local people ? from wrestlers and businesswomen \nto taxi drivers and Iran's leading pop star ? share their personal stories and feelings \nabout the current state of affairs in the country, Rageh uncovers a city of extremes, \nof wealth and poverty, where some people survive on less than a dollar a day and others \nshop till they drop in glitzy shopping malls.\n\nIran is also a youthful place; two-thirds of its 70m population is under 30. While \nfilming, Rageh is invited to write an article for a leading youth magazine. This takes \nhim on a journey to discover what life is like for young people and, in particular, \nyoung women in Iran ? and opens his eyes to the country's strict censorship rules.\n\nRageh Inside Iran is a film which transcends images of angry demonstrations and burning \nflags to reveal a country that isn't without its problems but which is also fascinating, \ndynamic and hospitable. \n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Rageh Inside Iran.WnA.avi\nFilesize.....: 699 MB (or 716,770 KB or 733,972,480 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:29:30 (134,252 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 980 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 105 kb/s (52/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.97\nFrame Size...: 608x352 (1.73:1) [=19:11]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:689cfce26603019a3bf8d7429990476419557bbb","amp;dn":"BBC+documentary+Inside+Iran+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"689cfce26603019a3bf8d7429990476419557bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,156,252,226,102,3,1,154,59,248,215,66,153,144,71,100,25,85,123,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
