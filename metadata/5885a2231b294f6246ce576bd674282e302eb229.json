The follow-up to their GrammyÃ‚Â® win is a freewheeling and high-energy collection of 12 original songs entitled 'Tell the Ones I Love.' The album showcases the Steep Canyon Rangers myriad talents instrumental agility, tight harmony vocals, and inventive songwriting, not to mention the integration of percussion. Recorded at Levon Helm s famed studio and produced by Larry Campbell, the highly sought after musician and GrammyÃ‚Â®-winning producer (Bob Dylan, Levon Helm) 'Tell the Ones I love' is a testament to just how far the boundaries of bluegrass can be stretched.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5885a2231b294f6246ce576bd674282e302eb229","amp;dn":"Steep+Canyon+Rangers+-+Tell+The+Ones+I+Love+%282013%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5885a2231b294f6246ce576bd674282e302eb229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,133,162,35,27,41,79,98,70,206,87,107,214,116,40,46,48,46,178,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
