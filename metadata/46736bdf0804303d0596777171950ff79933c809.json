This pack contains nine scenarios based in the modern era (2010 to 2014) and covers a wide variety of freight workings. From hauling a rake of car carriers with EWS liveried 92031, to a ballast train with two heritage class 37 locomotives, there's something for everyone in this pack.\n\nIn these scenarios, we've strived for realism in all areas. For example, each scenario uses the timetable of its relevant year to create an as realistic experience as possible. As well as this, realistic formations are used with most services having their headcode, time of leaving, origin and destination as their name so you can see which train is which!\n\nAll efforts have been made to ensure these scenarios work properly but there is a small possibility that one scenario may not work on a particular setup, and if so, we will try our best to fix it.\n\nRequirements\n\nExtra Stock - Download\n\nArmstrong Powerhouse Class 142 Diesel Multiple Unit Pack \n\nArmstrong Powerhouse HHA Wagon Pack \n\nArmstrong Powerhouse HIA Wagon Pack \n\nJust Trains Autoballaster JJA PlusPak \n\nJust Trains Cargowaggon Flat IGA PlusPak \n\nJust Trains Class 67 Advanced &amp; Car Carriers \n\nJust Trains Voyager - More Information OR Just Trains Voyager (Advanced)\n\nOovee Class 156 \n\nRS.com Class 86 \n\nRS.com Class 325 \n\nRS.com Class 390 \n\nRS.com EWS Class 66 V2.0 \n\nRS.com EWS Class 92 \n\nRS.com Freightliner Class 66 V2.0\n\nRS.com Settle to Carlisle \n\nRS.com West Coast Main Line Over Shap \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and seeed pls!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46736bdf0804303d0596777171950ff79933c809","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+AP39++WCML+Over+Shap+Scenario+Pack+%28Freight%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46736bdf0804303d0596777171950ff79933c809","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,115,107,223,8,4,48,61,5,150,119,113,113,149,15,247,153,51,200,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
