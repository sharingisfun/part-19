And slowly as the time went by, many of the projects were put on, stretched endlessly and in the end left unchanged unfixed and forever broken\nBut because of sweet open platform of the Skyrim and its great community, many fans were able to muscle through the pain of modding and sweat and tears and blood, sorrow and all the know terrors of the world programmers go through and bring you not only expanded world of the Skyrim, but also fix many of the known glitches, bugs, and performance issues over the Skyrim world.\n\n  So that's why am here to give you the gift of Skyrim as it was meant to play. This version of the Skyrim contains few land masses added to the game (((most of them here ARE following original Oblivion back story, even thou some things are not really accurate according to the books, they are still pretty close to its original stoty))), enhanced cities, towns and camps of Skyrim, few mods to clean the game from those annoying bugs and glitches that we all love and know, and last but not least few mods for minor ui changes for better pc control feel over the UI in tha game..\n\nDLC's :\n- Dawnguard\n- HearthFire\n- DragonBorn\n- HighResTexturePacks 1,2 and 3\n\nUnofficial DLC's :\n- Falskaar\n- Wyrmstooth\n- Immersive Solstheim Whiterun Patrolls II\n- ETac full\n- OBIS OBISDB\n- \nMods :\n- Unofficial Patch (fixes a lot of known issues with the game)\n- SkyUI\n- Weapns and Armor fixes (no added weapons and stuff like that, just balance and tweaks for optimization)\n- More bandit camps (whole areas around the endges were empty and sad, now they are fun and crazy)\n- 250 more npcs full voiced\n-Alternative start (adds that special feel to the game that your unique even thou your not, your just the same rat bastard like every one of us)\n- and heres lot more stuff... Point is no mods are added that change any aspect of gameplay just fixes and new world spaces, npcs or monesters... send me a email if you have any questions ...\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5a30352c3b34353133391a233b32353574393537&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4d42997deec3cdfc65b74849e0f636100cb87c7","amp;dn":"Skyrim+%2B+all+official+DLC%27s+%2B+my+favorite+DLC+like+mods+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4d42997deec3cdfc65b74849e0f636100cb87c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,212,41,151,222,236,60,223,198,91,116,132,158,15,99,97,0,203,135,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
