Hacking continues to develop, becoming ever more sophisticated, adapting and growing in ingenuity as well as in the damage that results. Web attacks running over web ports strike with enormous impact. Stuart McClure's new book focuses on Web hacking, an area where organizations are particularly vulnerable. The material covers the web commerce &quot;playground', describing web languages and protocols, web and database servers, and payment systems. The authors bring unparalleled insight to both well- known and lesser known web vulnerabilities. They show the dangerous range of the many different attacks web hackers harbor in their bag of tricks -- including buffer overflows, the most wicked of attacks, plus other advanced attacks. The book features complete methodologies, including techniques and attacks, countermeasures, tools, plus case studies and web attack scenarios showing how different attacks work and why they work.\n\nFollow us on facebook...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e3f3b9a427c32d4183532a11ad8e7b3c791e8d9","amp;dn":"Web+Hacking+-+Attacks+and+Defense.chm+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+Torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e3f3b9a427c32d4183532a11ad8e7b3c791e8d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,63,59,154,66,124,50,212,24,53,50,161,26,216,231,179,199,145,232,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
