Eric Banister\n\nWhen Bill Monroe died in 1996, Ricky Skaggs felt a heavy burden to continue the tradition Monroe had started just over 50 years before. He soon returned from country to his roots performing only bluegrass, and his newest release is a fantastic effort to remind newer fans where it all began. \n\nMining the original 28 sides cut by the band, that featured Monroe, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs, Chubby Wise and Howard Watts, Skaggs selected 12 songs ranging from the well-known &quot;Bluegrass Breakdown&quot; and &quot;Little Cabin Home On The Hill&quot; to lesser known gems like &quot;Goin&amp;#039; Back To Old Kentucky&quot; and &quot;Toy Heart.&quot; \n\nFor this tribute, Skaggs forgoes note-for-note re-creations and as is to be expected, Skaggs and his band do a masterful job of bringing these classics to life. He does pull in a couple of ex-Blue Grass Boys for help. Del McCoury lends his soaring tenor to &quot;The Old Crossroad&quot; and Earl Scruggs, the only surviving member of the original groundbreaking band picks his banjo on &quot;Goin&amp;#039; Back To Old Kentucky.&quot; \n\nThe album is a great album in and of itself, but it also serves as a great starting point for anyone interested in digging deeper into the bluegrass tradition.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nArtist...[ Ricky Skaggs And Kentucky Thunder\nTitle....[ Honoring The Fathers of Bluegrass\nGenre....[ Bluegrass                        \nYear.....[ 2008                             \nEncoder..[ LAME3.97 (-V2 --vbr-new)         \nBitrate..[ VBRkbps                          \nQuality..[ Joint-Stereo                     \nkHz......[ 44.1kHz                          \nSource...[ CDDA                             \nDate.....[ May-02-2008                      \nType.....[ Album                            \nSize.....[ 38,0 MB                          \nLable....[ Skaggs Family Records            \nCat.Nr...[ n/a                              \nURL......[ www.skaggsfamilyrecords.com      \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nNr.

Then in 1945 he    \nadded a singer and guitarist to his band named Lester Flatt,   \nand later in that same year he added an extraordinary          \nthree-finger-styled banjo player named Earl Scruggs to the     \ngroup, and suddenly that sound Monroe had been chasing was     \nright there in front of him. Bluegrass. Rounded out by Chubby  \nWise and Howard Watts, this version of the Bluegrass Boys      \ndidn&amp;#039;t get to record until almost a year later, but the rest,  \nas they so often say, is history. This lovingly assembled album\nis Ricky Skaggs&amp;#039; attempt to pay homage to that amazing band and\nhe leads his Kentucky Thunder ensemble through some of the     \nsongs that Monroe and company recorded in that first burst of  \nsessions for Columbia Records. It&amp;#039;s fitting that the only      \nsurviving member of that version of the Bluegrass Boys, the    \nstill astounding Earl Scruggs, is on hand here to help with the\nopening track, a fine version of &quot;Goin&amp;#039; Back to Old Kentucky.&quot; \nNothing replaces the original sides from 1946 and 1947,        \nnaturally, but these renditions, particularly on tracks like   \nthe lovely &quot;When You&amp;#039;re Lonely,&quot; the wise and cautionary &quot;The  \nOld Crossroad,&quot; and the blistering instrumental explosion of   \n&quot;Bluegrass Breakdown,&quot; gently and warmly remind just how       \ninnovative and fresh the Bluegrass Boys really were some       \nsixty-plus years ago. They created the very template for       \nbluegrass, and while modern players have stretched the         \nboundaries a bit, bluegrass in the 21st century is still very  \nmuch that long ago sound Monroe heard in his head.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5f14f19134add2b891514392d9c11afe4abe7d6","amp;dn":"Ricky+Skaggs-Honoring+the+Fathers+of+Bluegrass%3A+Tribute+to+1946+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5f14f19134add2b891514392d9c11afe4abe7d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,241,79,25,19,74,221,43,137,21,20,57,45,156,17,175,228,171,231,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
