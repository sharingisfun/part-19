Their music mixes elements of rock with blues and pop. Although they have had some success both nationally and internationally, it's on their native Long Island that they have always been best known.\n\nAny torrent I could find was dead, with no seeders. I was about to piece together this torrent using various sources, torrents that didn't completely download, etc. Oddly enough, the best source for The Good Rats mp3's were Russian websites.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5f56fd9b8468f5e728fa8dc485c1631a85ac49f","amp;dn":"The+Good+Rats+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5f56fd9b8468f5e728fa8dc485c1631a85ac49f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,245,111,217,184,70,143,94,114,143,168,220,72,92,22,49,168,90,196,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
