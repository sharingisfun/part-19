This is precisely what:\n : visionary tycoon, Sir Jack Pitman, seeks to accomplish on the Isle of      :\n : Wight, a &quot;destination&quot; where tourists can find replicas of Big Ben (half   :\n : size), Princess Di's grave, and even Harrod's (conveniently located inside :\n : the tower of London).                                                      :\n :                                                                            :\n : Martha Cochrane, hired as one of Sir Jack's resident &quot;no-people,&quot; ably     :\n : assists him in realizing his dream. But when this land of make-believe     :\n : gradually gets horribly and hilariously out of hand, Martha develops her   :\n : own vision of the perfect England. Julian Barnes delights us with a novel  :\n : that is at once a philosophical inquiry, a burst of mischief, and a moving :\n : elegy about authenticity and nationality.                                  :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee723316a1ee062aa0edf0c1c6f375488af8801d","amp;dn":"Julian+Barnes+England+England+2009+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee723316a1ee062aa0edf0c1c6f375488af8801d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,114,51,22,161,238,6,42,160,237,240,193,198,243,117,72,138,248,128,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
