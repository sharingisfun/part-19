When you think about it, his transition from Texas sharecropper to WW II hero to Hollywood actor is remarkable. True, it was hard for him to loosen up on screen, still he delivered his lines well enough, while nobody could do a hard-eyed stare better. \n\nHere Murphy does well enough, carrying most of the movie. The role of a hard eyed loner (Ring Hassard) appears tailor made for him. At the same time, diminutive, girlish Hendrix (Riley) manages her courtroom lawyer sequence in pretty convincing fashion. Ironic to think the two were married at the time, but in the process of getting divorced. So there's something poignant about their riding into the sunset at movie's end.\n\nUniversal popped for a pretty big budget, unlike many of Murphy's later westerns. The red rock Kanab (Utah) locations are really eye-catching. Then too, those wild horse herds are anything but skimpy. And nobody could strum a guitar more soothingly than the rotund Burl Ives. Together they add a lot of color and mood to the dramatics. At the same time, there's not much gunplay, yet quite a bit of suspense to the rather complex story.\nAll in all, it's a picturesque, entertaining Murphy western. \n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 622mb\nDuration.... 01:23:12\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 919kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 120kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95246c886b79eff8863526b0c86d5f5eecd23f70","amp;dn":"Sierra+1950+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95246c886b79eff8863526b0c86d5f5eecd23f70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,36,108,136,107,121,239,248,134,53,38,176,200,109,95,94,236,210,63,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
