Since the dawn of man, men have worshiped stone figures and have gone as far as to sacrifice people on altars to stone gods in hopes they will be given empowerment and or enlightenment.\n\n&quot;You don't see them, not unless you know what to look for. But they see you. They're always there, standing, perching, sitting, crouching, hiding, always watching, observing, sometimes grinning, certainly leering. I call them beasts: Stony beasts.\n\nThe Bible speaks of them as &quot;idols&quot; and warns that while they may consist of mere stone, marble, plaster, or wood, they nevertheless have supernatural powers of hideously strange nature. To deny this is to risk falling victim to their foul and overwhelmingly repugnant grip.\n\nTheir universal existence, often in the most unexpected places, is no accident. It was planned long ago that they would be there. But even after you discover their presence, these menacing, grotesque, supernatural entities refuse to budge. They seem to be carefully obeying the orders of someone, somewhere who sent them forth to be advance agents of some mysterious, dark force. In accomplishing this mission, they are unusually successful, hugely so, harbingers as they are of a cruel and evil agenda which, some horrible day surprisingly soon, will be fully realized.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Texe Marrs\n\nOther Texe Marrs films:\n\nThunder Over Zion &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4387401/Thunder_Over_Zion_-_Texe_Marrs_AVI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4387401/Thunder_Over_Zion_-_Texe_Marrs_AVI&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMasonic Lodge Over Jerusalem &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4644524/Masonic_Lodge_Over_Jerusalem_-_Texe_Marrs_AVI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4644524/Masonic_Lodge_Over_Jerusalem_-_Texe_Marrs_AVI&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCauldron of Abaddon &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4304903/Cauldron_of_Abaddon_-_Texe_Marrs_Divx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4304903/Cauldron_of_Abaddon_-_Texe_Marrs_Divx&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlanet X &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4783818/Planet_X_-_Texe_Marrs_avi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4783818/Planet_X_-_Texe_Marrs_avi&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy public URL:\t  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy RSS feed:\t  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&lt;/a&gt;\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4dd8cc4aab55ba9e7104d1e4bd7e9bab8338e47","amp;dn":"Face+to+Face+With+the+Devil+-+Texe+Marrs+Film","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4dd8cc4aab55ba9e7104d1e4bd7e9bab8338e47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,221,140,196,170,181,91,169,231,16,77,30,75,215,233,186,184,51,142,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
