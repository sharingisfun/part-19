It took several\r\n attempts using less bandwidth, to get the quality I was happy with. The final encoding required 13 days on a spare Athlon PC!\r\n\r\nThe audio is 5.1 AC3 at 384kbps. Unusually, this blu-ray plays at 29.97fps (NTSC speed). I tried to use inverse telecine to convert \r\nit to 23.976fps but the results were poor in places, so 29.97fps it is, I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nI also included named chapter marks, so that you can locate your prefered songs.\r\n\r\nHere are the tracks:-\r\n\r\n00:01:40.000 Good Times, Bad Times\r\n00:04:55.000 Ramble On\r\n00:10:30.000 Black Dog\r\n00:15:57.000 In My Time of Dying\r\n00:28:14.000 For Your Life\r\n00:35:14.000 Trampled Under Foot\r\n00:42:18.000 Nobody's Fault But Mine\r\n00:49:16.000 No Quarter\r\n00:58:41.000 Since I've Been Loving You\r\n01:07:05.000 Dazed and Confused\r\n01:18:59.000 Stairway To Heaven\r\n01:27:47.000 The Song Remains The Same\r\n01:34:25.000 Misty Mountain Hop\r\n01:39:33.000 Kashmir\r\n01:49:38.000 Whole Lotta Love\r\n01:58:02.000 Rock and Roll\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and please, please, continue to seed after you have download\r\n\r\n\r\nScreens:-\r\n \nhttps://postimg.org/image/62sem7l4h/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/853va5wmp/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/w4th20pr5/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/utvv56k1d/\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nCodec:                  h265 10 Bit LE\r\nChroma Format:          4:2:0\r\nFramerate:              29.971\r\nBitrate:                2000 Kbps average, max 3000 kbps\r\nResolution:             1920 x 1080\r\nMode:                   Progressive\r\n\r\nAudio:\r\n\r\nCodec:                  AC3 5.1\r\nBitrate:                384kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:558ba90fd4c4c707e40f4d2212e5f10bbcb6cbad","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+Celebration+Day+Blu-Ray+1080p+HEVC+10Bit+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"558ba90fd4c4c707e40f4d2212e5f10bbcb6cbad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,139,169,15,212,196,199,7,228,15,77,34,18,229,241,11,188,182,203,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
