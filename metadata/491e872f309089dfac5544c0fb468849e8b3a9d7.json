Very difficult, Rappan Athuk will truly strike fear into the hearts of the most stalwart adventurers. It offers legions of inventive traps, tricks, strange features, and monsters -- many of them never before seen. It affords numerous opportunities for roleplaying, but anyone willing to brave these subterranean halls better arrive ready to rumble, or their lives will be short indeed.\n\n\nPS: Support the companies, which games you actually enjoy :)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:491e872f309089dfac5544c0fb468849e8b3a9d7","amp;dn":"Pathfinder+RPG+-+Rappan+Athuk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"491e872f309089dfac5544c0fb468849e8b3a9d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,30,135,47,48,144,137,223,172,85,68,192,251,70,136,73,232,179,169,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
