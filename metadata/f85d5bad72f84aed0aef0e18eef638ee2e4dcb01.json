The fifth edition uses all strands of the &quot;Rule of Four&quot; - graphical, numeric, symbolic/algebraic, and verbal/applied presentations - to make concepts easier to understand. The book focuses on exploring fundamental ideas rather than comprehensive coverage of multiple similar cases that are not fundamentally unique. Calculus teachers will build on their understanding in the field and discover new ways to present concepts to their students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f85d5bad72f84aed0aef0e18eef638ee2e4dcb01","amp;dn":"Calculus+-+Single+and+Multivariable+5th+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f85d5bad72f84aed0aef0e18eef638ee2e4dcb01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,93,91,173,114,248,74,237,10,239,14,24,238,246,56,238,46,77,203,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
