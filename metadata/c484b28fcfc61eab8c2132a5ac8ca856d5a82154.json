Lead singer/guitarist Nick Blinko is notorious for his witty macabre lyrics and dark pen-and-ink artwork, prominently featured on all of Rudimentary Peni's albums. Blinko is also rumored to have written the band's Pope Adrian 37th Psychristiatric album whilst resident in a psychiatric hospital. Bassist Grant Matthews has also written a number of songs for the band, though his lyrics primarily focus on sociopolitical themes. Very few photos exist of the band, as their albums feature Blinko's drawings instead, but Pushead published a few in an early edition of his magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nCacophony (1993) 99.87% CDDA\n\nDeath Church [Reissue] (1994) 99.71% CDDA\n\nThe E.P.'s Of R.P (1994) 99.83% CDDA\n\nPope Adrian 37th Psychristiatric (1995) 99.67% CDDA\n\nEchoes Of Anguish (1997) 99.92% CDDA\n\nThe Underclass (2000) 99.92% CDDA\n\nArchaic (2004) 99.83% CDDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c484b28fcfc61eab8c2132a5ac8ca856d5a82154","amp;dn":"Rudimentary+Peni+-+7CD+Punk+Collection+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c484b28fcfc61eab8c2132a5ac8ca856d5a82154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,132,178,143,207,198,30,171,140,33,50,165,172,140,168,86,213,168,33,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
