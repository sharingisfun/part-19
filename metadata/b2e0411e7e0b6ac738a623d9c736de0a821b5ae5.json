It is usually described as one of Tolstoy's two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world's greatest novels.\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, marriage, age, and death. Though it is often called a novel today, it broke so many conventions of the form that it was not considered a novel in its time. Indeed, Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2e0411e7e0b6ac738a623d9c736de0a821b5ae5","amp;dn":"War+and+Peace+by+Lev+Nikolayevich+Tolstoy+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2e0411e7e0b6ac738a623d9c736de0a821b5ae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,224,65,30,126,11,106,199,56,166,35,217,199,54,222,10,130,27,90,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
