Not only was she a Grammy Award-nominated American singer, songwriter, pianist, and arranger, but she was also a staunch civil rights activist and voice for black America. In her lifetime, she recorded over 40 live and studio albums, spanning the genres of jazz, soul, folk, R&amp;B, gospel, and pop music, and setting the stage for future generations of artists including Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, Lauryn Hill, and many more\n\nHere is Nina Simone in incredibly intense performances, sounding as passionate and comfortable belting out a rock song as she does singing jazz or blues. This new collection of never before seen video and live tracks dubbed &quot;Protest Anthology&quot; collects eight previously unreleased video interviews and 11 unheard live tracks of hit songs &quot;Mississippi Goddamn,&quot; &quot;Backlash Blues,&quot; &quot;To Be Young, Gifted, and Black,&quot; and more in one package, and it will offer fans a look at the Ã¢â‚¬Å“High Priestess of SoulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as she really was both on and off stage.\n\nThe first volume of a five-release series, these tracks contain some of Nina Simone's most political statements ever captured, and truly sum up her strong viewpoints on being black in America during the 1960s, viewpoints that surely would have been controversial in her time. These recordings are finally being unearthed under exclusive license from her ex-husband Andy Stroud.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33678fe79446f6b3e93b7bb1f048006517d01b34","amp;dn":"Nina+Simone+-+Protest+Anthology+%5B2008%5D+mp3+V0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33678fe79446f6b3e93b7bb1f048006517d01b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,103,143,231,148,70,246,179,233,59,123,177,240,72,0,101,23,208,27,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
