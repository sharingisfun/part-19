Later, when the Third Hokage comes to his house to give him his allowance Naruto asks him who his parents were and what were they like. The Hokage refuses to answer him, telling Naruto that it wouldn't bring back the dead. A few years later, while in the Academy, Naruto meets Sasuke Uchiha and is continuously defeated by him. During one spar, Naruto realises that Sasuke's eyes are filled with hatred. Shortly after that, he finds out that Sasuke is the only survivor of the Uchiha clan massacre. After graduating, Naruto and Sasuke are placed on the same team along with Sakura Haruno and manage to pass Kakashi's bell test. As they go to their mission to the Land of Waves, they are attacked and Naruto gets injured. To everyone's dismay, Naruto pierces his own hand to remove the venom and vows to never need to be saved again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:536333922359070feb0f03cff69da90a1e1e163e","amp;dn":"%5BM%40nI%5D+Naruto+Shippuden%2FShippuuden+257+720p+%28Dual+Audio%29+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"536333922359070feb0f03cff69da90a1e1e163e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,99,51,146,35,89,7,15,235,15,3,207,246,157,169,10,30,30,22,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
