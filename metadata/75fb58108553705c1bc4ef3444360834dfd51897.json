For the purposes of understanding the coverage here, attention must be paid to the meaning of the word scandal: the damage to reputation brought on by the violation of codes of morality or proprietary to which the transgressors are normally expected to adhere. For example, one article covers the resignation of former New York governor Eliot Spitzer in early 2008, after he admitted to using an escort service for a prostitute. Each essay focuses on a single event, or series of closely related events, that has been perceived as a scandal. The essays reconstruct what happened, why the events are considered scandals, and what their impact on history has been. The chronological distribution of topics is weighted toward the most recent yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€more than half of the topics from 1970 onward and one-quarter from the years since 2001. However, every decade of the 20th century is represented by no fewer than 12 topics, and only three decades have fewer than 20 topics. BOTTOM LINE This set offers unprecedented breadth and depth on the subject. Suitable for a wide range of library types.Ã¢â‚¬â€Albert Vara, Temple Univ.
