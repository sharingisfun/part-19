Oldham was so entranced by the Beach Boys' 1966 album, Pet Sounds that he enlisted songwriter Billy Nicholls to record a British response, which became this largely forgotten album. The Small Faces' Steve Marriott can be heard very prominently on &quot;Would You Believe?,&quot; despite Oldham's attempts to drown him out with heavy orchestration. Oldham wanted this to be the British Pet Sounds but financial difficulties with the label caused it to be shelved (it only achieved an initial promotional run of 100 copies, as Immediate IMCP009) before it ever hit the streets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984f40a2062c1d1f962f81b6867571e2b94895f5","amp;dn":"Billy+Nicholls+-+Would+You+Believe+%281968%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984f40a2062c1d1f962f81b6867571e2b94895f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,79,64,162,6,44,29,31,150,47,129,182,134,117,113,226,185,72,149,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
