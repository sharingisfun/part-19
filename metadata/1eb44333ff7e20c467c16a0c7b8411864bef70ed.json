Of the four founding members, only Hugh Cornwell had any kind of recognizable historical pedigree, having played alongside Richard Thompson in the schoolboy band Emil &amp; the Detectives. According to Thompson, their repertoire stretched from &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; and the blues, through to &quot;old Kiki Dee B-sides,&quot; while their gigging was largely confined to the Hornsey School of Art, where Thompson's sister was Social Secretary. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.
