He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run with lightning speed, sunlight doesn't hurt him and he doesn't have an unquenchable lust for blood. Gene is a human, and he knows the rules. Keep the truth a secret. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only way to stay alive in a world of nightÃ¢â‚¬â€a world where humans are considered a delicacy and hunted for their blood.\nWhen heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chosen for a once in a lifetime opportunity to hunt the last remaining humans, GeneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carefully constructed life begins to crumble around him. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thrust into the path of a girl who makes him feel things he never thought possibleÃ¢â‚¬â€and into a ruthless pack of hunters whose suspicions about his true nature are growing. Now that Gene has finally found something worth fighting for, his need to survive is stronger than everÃ¢â‚¬â€but is it worth the cost of his humanity?
