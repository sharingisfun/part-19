Under the influence of Earth's yellow sun, these Daxamite terrorists have gained Superman-like powers and have become impossible for the heroes to hold back - let alone defeat. Victory seems impossible until RJ Brande, the Legion's founder, presents his secret weapon: Jan Arrah, the last surviving transmuter from Trom.\n\n\nThanks goes to MaidOfMight for this release.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d409ef9b439ddb6489dce03d8f96be9ccb07b2","amp;dn":"+Legionnaires+Annual+02+%281995-08%29+%28MaidOfMight-Novus-HD%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d409ef9b439ddb6489dce03d8f96be9ccb07b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,212,9,239,155,67,157,219,100,137,220,224,61,143,150,190,156,203,7,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
