You exist in this world only as a virtual presence, a sort of remote-control existence, which the computer portrays as a hand-shaped mouse cursor. In this world are a range of locations and strange creatures, related loosely (and with considerable poetic license) to Northern myth. You begin near to the long-abandoned home of a family of Norns (small furry creatures), where a few eggs, languishing in a broken-down incubator, are almost all that remains of the Nornir race.\n\nThe first game in this twin pack introduces you to the world of artificial life technology and the Norns of Albia. Than you can discover the all-new Norns, Ettins and Grendels. Explore the Shee Laboratories and discover the all-new Norns inhabiting a vibrant, living eco-system - find the Genetic Splicer and defend your Norns against the vicious and disease-ridden Grendels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7814fe1c8f162f0a05886e5c03531ca8bae0889","amp;dn":"Creatures+-+The+Albian+Years+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7814fe1c8f162f0a05886e5c03531ca8bae0889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,129,79,225,200,241,98,240,160,88,134,229,192,53,49,202,139,174,8,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
