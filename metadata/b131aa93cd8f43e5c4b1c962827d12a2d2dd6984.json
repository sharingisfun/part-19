In the ten years since the publication of the Star Wars Encyclopedia, a lot has happened in that galaxy far, far away: four new feature films, a host of official original novels, comics, video games, and more. Now, thirty years of information on all things Star Wars-ranging from science and technology to history and geography, culture and biography to ecology and cosmology-has been supplemented with an entire decade's worth of all-new material. Abundantly illustrated with full-color artwork and photos, and now in a new three-volume edition to accommodate its wealth of detailed entries, the Star Wars Encyclopedia encompasses the full measure of George Lucas's creation.\n\nHere's just a sampling of what's inside:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ character portraits of both the renowned (Luke Skywalker, Queen Amidala, Darth Vader) and the obscure (Tnun Bdu, Tycho Celchu, Bib Fortuna)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ the natives and customs of planets as diverse as Tatooine and Hoth, Dagobah and Kashyyyk\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ the rituals, secrets, and traditions of Jedi Knights and Sith Lords\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ a timeline of major events in Star Wars history, from the Clone Wars and the inception of the Empire to the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker and the invasion of the monstrous Yuuzhan Vong\n\nScrupulously researched and written by leading authorities Stephen J. Sansweet, Pablo Hidalgo, Bob Vitas, and Daniel Wallace, this landmark work is the must-have centerpiece of every Star Wars library.\n\n\n\nFrom the up loader:\nIt took me about a week to scan all 3 volumes.  I had been waiting for someone to upload it for a year but no one did so I figured I'd buy it and do it myself :) enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b131aa93cd8f43e5c4b1c962827d12a2d2dd6984","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Star+Wars+Encyclopedia+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b131aa93cd8f43e5c4b1c962827d12a2d2dd6984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,49,170,147,205,143,67,229,196,177,201,98,130,125,18,162,210,221,105,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
