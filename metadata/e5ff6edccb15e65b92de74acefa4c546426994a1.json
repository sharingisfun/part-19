It was released on 9 September 1996 on S2 Records in the United Kingdom and 14 January 1997 on Work Group in the United States. The album features the international hit single &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot;. The album has a more diverse sound than previous albums, with more instrumental tracks, and a greater electronic influence, evident in songs such as &quot;Alright&quot;, which mixed new synthetic sounds with shades of acid jazz. It also entered the Guinness Records as the best-selling funk album in history.\nSony Music released Jamiroquai's first three albums as two-CD deluxe editions on 11 March 2013 (in the UK) to celebrate 20 years since their first album on the label. Emergency On Planet Earth (1993), The Return Of The Space Cowboy (1994), and Travelling Without Moving (1996) have been remastered and come with bonus discs of B-sides, live performances, and rarities, including unreleased BBC archive material.\n\n\nReview:\n&quot;Travelling Without Moving,&quot; was the album that made Jamiroquai a household name throughout the world. Although his two prior albums were successes, &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; certified his status as the undeniable king of modern funk and soul. While many would doubt that a short &quot;white boy,&quot; could really get his groove on, they are sadly mistaken.\nHere is the band that brought the soul and funk the 1970's and 1980's were memorable for back, and totally changed the face of these musical styles forever. Groups such as Cameo, Parliament, Kool &amp; the Gang, and Earth Wind and Fire, were the godfathers of the past, but the fact that lead singer Jay Kay is English and sounds a lot like a young Stevie Wonder makes it much more appealing that funk &amp; soul have crossed racial lines to become an appreciated form of international music.\nTracks such as &quot;Cosmic Girl,&quot; and &quot;Alright&quot; bring back the spirit of 1970's funk to a newer generation of music listeners everywhere. &quot;Alright,&quot; which is my favorite track on the album, is memorable due to Jay Kay's divine vocals and his band's excellent orchestration of the music. &quot;Cosmic Girl,&quot; is a fun, lively song that will make anyone who lived during the seventies feel that they are reliving them again.\nFor all of you who need an all-instrumental song that will blow your mind away, try &quot;Didjital Vibrations.&quot; That song's use of Australian Aboriginal woodwinds and traditional instruments, plus Jay Kay's humming will make you feel so relaxed, that it almost seems that you are in some type of relaxation therapy that will alleviate most of your stress and worries away.\n&quot;Virtual Insanity,&quot; and his incredible video already have become classics both on radio and television. The beautiful song, &quot;Everyday,&quot; explores Jamiroquai's ability to carry a love ballad similar in the same tradition Marvin Gaye and Barry White became famous for. Finally, the album's title track, &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; is an awesome-sounding track that uses a small amount of lyrics, but plenty of groove (and also &quot;horsepower&quot;) to keep one's attention alive.\n&quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; is a must have album for anyone who adores funk, soul, or disco. It is a landmark album in the 1990's music scene. No one should pass this album by!\nReview by Luis Hernandez (Amazon)\n\n\nTracklist:\nDisc: 1\n01. Virtual Insanity (Remastered)\n02.
