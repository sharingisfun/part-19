From these meager beginnings grew his greatest album. Duane Allman joined the band shortly after recording began, and his spectacular slide guitar pushed Clapton to new heights. Then again, Clapton may have gotten there without him, considering the emotional turmoil he was in during the recording.\n\nHe was in hopeless, unrequited love with Patti Boyd, the wife of his best friend, George Harrison, and that pain surges throughout Layla, especially on its epic title track. But what really makes Layla such a powerful record is that Clapton, ignoring the traditions that occasionally painted him into a corner, simply tears through these songs with burning, intense emotion. He makes standards like &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows You (When You're Down and Out)&quot; into his own, while his collaborations with Bobby Whitlock -- including &quot;Any Day&quot; and &quot;Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?&quot; -- teem with passion. And, considering what a personal album Layla is, it's somewhat ironic that the lovely coda &quot;Thorn Tree in the Garden&quot; is a solo performance by Whitlock, and that the song sums up the entire album as well as &quot;Layla&quot; itself.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12b88e9ca48a4a8bb615784f7242df060b335a16","amp;dn":"Derek+%26amp%3B+The+Dominos+-+Layla+AOALS+%5B2CD%5D+%282011%29+40th+Annivers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12b88e9ca48a4a8bb615784f7242df060b335a16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,184,142,156,164,138,74,139,182,21,120,79,114,66,223,6,11,51,90,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
