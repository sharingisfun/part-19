For completist collectors, however, it's valuable for the inclusion of a bunch of things that don't show up too often on such compilations. With 26 tracks and 72 minutes of music, it's a pretty good value for an under-the-counter item. The length and breadth of the material means it's pretty difficult to summarize in a paragraph or two, but the highlights include a version of &quot;It's All Too Much&quot; with some brief sections (and lyrics) that didn't make it into the final edit; a 1963 John Lennon solo piano demo of &quot;I'm in Love,&quot; which the Fourmost covered, but the Beatles never put on their own records; a brass overdub session for &quot;Penny Lane&quot;; a sloppier alternate take of &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; (not the same alternate as appears on the official Anthology 2), and Lennon home demos for &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot; and &quot;Hey Bulldog.&quot; Other tracks are less interesting, as they're similar to many of the official versions or overdubs in isolation from the completed recordings. And while the numerous extracts from a television special on the making of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band allow us to hear some isolated vocal and instrumental tracks, that's more interesting for scholarly study than audio enjoyment (and they'd be easier to bear if they were grouped together rather than scattered throughout the disc). Keep in mind, too, that some of these tracks have appeared in better quality on other bootlegs, though you'll need one of those small-press collector handbooks to try to make sense of what appears where in its best form.
