Based on the best-selling novel by Jeremy Larner, Drive, He Said, free-spirited and sobering by turns, is a sketch of the exploits of a disaffected college basketball player (William Tepper) and his increasingly radical roommate (Michael Margotta), as well as a feverishly shot and edited snapshot of the early seventies (some of it was filmed during an actual campus protest). Fueled by Vietnam-era anxieties and perched on the edge of utter insanity, Nicholson's audacious comedy (also starring Bruce Dern and Karen Black) is a startling howl direct from the zeitgeist.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img718.imageshack.us/img718/3730/vlcsnap2010121717h04m42.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img718.imageshack.us/img718/3730/vlcsnap2010121717h04m42.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img143.imageshack.us/img143/4940/vlcsnap2010121717h05m17.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img143.imageshack.us/img143/4940/vlcsnap2010121717h05m17.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/6643/vlcsnap2010121717h05m30.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/6643/vlcsnap2010121717h05m30.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----not my rip----------\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,566,117,888 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:30:29\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x384 (AR: 1.833)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1919 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.296 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 384 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
