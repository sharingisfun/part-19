It features the Ralph Brewster Singers along with an orchestra conducted by Gordon Jenkins.\n\nCapitol reissued the album in 1963 with different cover art and a new title, The Sinatra Christmas Album, a title which also featured on the album's initial 1987 compact disc pressing. The original title and cover were eventually restored for subsequent CD pressings in 1990 and 1999. In 2001, the album art was altered from its 1957 version. The CD bonus tracks were originally issued on a 1954 Capitol 45 rpm single, arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle.\n\nIn 2007 the album was reissued yet again, with a &quot;50th Anniversary&quot; banner placed atop the 2001 cover art and an additional bonus track (a vintage radio PSA that Sinatra did for the American Lung Association's &quot;Christmas Seals&quot; campaign) added.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e07d23aa5163ca75a4ed56e323cec5cb48ca46a","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+A+Jolly+Christmas+%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e07d23aa5163ca75a4ed56e323cec5cb48ca46a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,7,210,58,165,22,60,167,90,78,213,110,50,60,236,92,180,140,164,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
