It is noted for its long introductory passage of clocks chiming and alarms ringing, recorded as a quadrophonic test by Alan Parsons, not specifically for the album.\n\nThe song is a memento mori describing the phenomenon in which time seems to pass more quickly as one ages, often leading to despair in old age over missed opportunities of the past.\n\nEach clock at the beginning of the song was recorded separately in an antiques store. This is followed by a two-minute passage dominated by Nick Mason's drum solo, with rototoms and backgrounded by a tocking sound created by Roger Waters picking two muted strings on his bass. With David Gilmour singing lead on the verses and with Richard Wright singing lead vocals on the bridges and with female singers and David Gilmour providing backup vocals, the lyrics of the song deal with Roger Waters's realization that life was not about preparing yourself for what happens next, but about grabbing control of your own destiny.\n\nA guitar solo from Gilmour provides the refrain over the same chord progressions as the verse and bridge. A reprise of the album's earlier &quot;Breathe&quot;, containing a similar melody and beat, characterised by Mason's drumming and a similar vocal line, brings the song to a closing, before it segues into &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;. When the tom drums were recorded, there were only three available so the band had to tune the drum after each hit to get the right pitch and then mix the hit into the song.\n\nIn January 2007, readers of the Guitar World magazine voted Gilmour's guitar solo on the song the 21st greatest guitar solo of all time.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, and was released in March 1973. The concept album  built on ideas explored by the band in their live shows and earlier recordings, but it lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterised their work following the departure in 1968 of founding member, principal composer, and lyricist Syd Barrett. The Dark Side of the Moon's themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.\n\nThe album was developed as part of a forthcoming tour of live performances, and was premiered several months before studio recording began. The new material was further refined during the tour and was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. The group used some of the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesisers were given prominence in several tracks, and a series of recorded interviews with staff and band personnel provided the source material for a range of philosophical quotations used throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was directly responsible for some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album, including the non-lexical performance of Clare Torry. The album's iconic sleeve features a prism that represents the band's stage lighting, the record's lyrics, and the request for a &quot;simple and bold&quot; design.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was an immediate success, topping the Billboard 200 for one week. It subsequently remained in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988, longer than any other album in history. With an estimated 45 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums worldwide. It has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered by several other acts. It spawned two singles, &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot;. In addition to its commercial success, The Dark Side of the Moon is one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently ranked as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:038956fdd3cfcba7c1413c8aeaa9e85554ce67fc","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Time+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"038956fdd3cfcba7c1413c8aeaa9e85554ce67fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,137,86,253,211,207,203,167,193,65,60,138,234,169,232,85,84,206,103,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
