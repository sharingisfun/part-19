We show how easy it is to trick your sense of taste by changing the colours of food and drink, explain how what you see can change what you hear, and see just how unreliable our sense of colour can be. But all this trickery has a serious purpose. It's helping scientists to create a new understanding of how our senses work - not as individual senses, but connected together. It holds the intriguing possibility that one sense could be mapped into another.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.72GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available at mvgroup)\nSource: DVB-S\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a149e3a5498bdfd895e623b0d62d6b80154b4034","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2010+Is+Seeing+Believing+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a149e3a5498bdfd895e623b0d62d6b80154b4034","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,73,227,165,73,139,223,216,149,230,35,176,214,45,107,128,21,75,64,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
