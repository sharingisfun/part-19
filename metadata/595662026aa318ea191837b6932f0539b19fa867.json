Amos Kollek\n\nDeauville Film Festival - NOMINATED - Grand Special Prize\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168787/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168787/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFilmed in New York City, New York, USA\n\nDirector Amos Kollek continues his exploration of the theme of lonely women lost in the big city with Fiona, which goes further and exposes the wasted lives of whores and junkies in New York City. Fiona was abandoned by her mother when she was six months old. She grew up in foster homes where she was abused and finally became a crack-smoking prostitute. She lives her life according to her own rules, without any qualms. After a fiasco with three cops in a restaurant, she hides out in a derelict building where drug addicts squat. By now she is thirty-one years old. She meets another woman, Anita, who carries the scars of her life on the streets. Gritty and unsparing, the film blends an original screenplay with actual documentary footage shot in a Lower East Side crack-house with prostitutes playing some of the key roles. The tender relationship between these women is felt without descending into voyeurism or pity and is depicted with an authenticity that transcends the line between fiction and documentary.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 640x528, 25.000 fps, 1056 Kbps, 01h21m32s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\n\nDVDRip, English audio, optional French subtitles\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/qgm39m5z3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/qgm39m5z3/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/j4gladh83/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/j4gladh83/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/vx9ao1i7n/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/vx9ao1i7n/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/e397909rn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/e397909rn/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/83lg5coz7/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/83lg5coz7/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:595662026aa318ea191837b6932f0539b19fa867","amp;dn":"Fiona+-+1998+%5BAmos+Kollek%5D+NYC+junkie+crime+drama+-+french+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"595662026aa318ea191837b6932f0539b19fa867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,86,98,2,106,163,24,234,25,24,55,182,147,47,5,57,177,159,168,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
