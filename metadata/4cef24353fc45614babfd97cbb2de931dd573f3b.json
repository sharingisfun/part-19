Fitts\n\nReview\n&quot;The writing and presentation is clear and economical. The figures have a crisp and uncluttered look to them. Fitts stresses concepts over formal development....a fine textbook.&quot;\n-Roger Beckie, Univ. British Columbia, for VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL, 2003\n\n&quot;Groundwater Science would serve well as the text for an introductory groundwater course...The graphics are crisp and explanatory.
