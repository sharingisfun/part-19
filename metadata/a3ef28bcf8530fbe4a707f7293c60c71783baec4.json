Sword of Honour, a splendid British miniseries, is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Evelyn Waugh. Waugh's alter ego in the film, Guy Crouchback, played with gravitas, fortitude, and a wee bit of vulnerability by a pre-James Bond Daniel Craig, joins the World War II effort as an older soldier because he feels a pure calling to fight evil. And fight he does, though the realities of war and army life are ultimately revealed to him in all their venality and haphazardness. The film sweeps across Europe, from pre-war England--where life for the upper crust is all crisp linen, martinis, and a fierce denial of the notion that the British Empire is, in fact, doomed--to Capt. Crouchback's missions in Vichy France, an utterly destroyed Crete, Egypt, and more. All the while, Crouchback fights his own demons along with the Nazis; his alluring ex-wife, Virginia (played with sultry sensuality by the American actress Megan Dodds, so memorable in the British series MI-5), to whom Crouchback is undeniably still drawn. The action and production values are top-notch, as is the ensemble cast. But the key is Craig, whose world-weary demeanour only barely masks the needs of a soldier--and a man--who is all too human. His performance is soul-stirring and even those who think they aren't war-film fans will be captivated by the layered storytelling here.\n\nDirector: Bill Anderson\n\nWriter:  William Boyd, based on the novels by Evelyn Waugh\n\nStars: Daniel Craig, Megan Dodds, Nicholas Boulton, Adam Godley, Selina Cadell, Katrin Cartlidge, Leslie Phillips, Guy Henry, Simon Williams, Patrick Hannaway, Sean McKenzie\n\nRun time 191 minutes\n\nSize: 1.78 GB \n\nRipped from DVD and converted to AVI\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nTam&amp;Carla\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3ef28bcf8530fbe4a707f7293c60c71783baec4","amp;dn":"Sword+of+Honour+%282001%29+DvDrip%5BEng%5D+Tam.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3ef28bcf8530fbe4a707f7293c60c71783baec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,239,40,188,248,83,15,190,74,112,127,114,147,198,12,113,120,59,174,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
