Two men, two women, each with their own reasons for being there. But after twelve weeks, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready for a break and pile into a Land Cruiser for an adventure.\n\nThey get more than they bargained for. Bandits hijack them. They wake up in a hut, hooded, bound, no food or water. Hostages. As a personal favor, John Wells is asked to try to find them, but he does so reluctantly. East Africa isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t his usual playing field. And when he arrives, he finds that the truth behind the kidnappings is far more complex than he imagined.\n\nThe clock is ticking. The White House is edging closer to an invasion of Somalia. Wells has a unique ability to go undercover, and to make things happen, but if he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find the hostages soon, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be dead Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the U.S. may be in a war it never should have begun.\n\nFull Retail ePub, Calibre Ready","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b40ecd2d0e5289054760d8f9a6f7ccf5e3bb8f3","amp;dn":"The+Night+Ranger+by+Alex+Berenson+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b40ecd2d0e5289054760d8f9a6f7ccf5e3bb8f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,64,236,210,208,229,40,144,84,118,13,143,154,111,124,207,94,59,184,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
