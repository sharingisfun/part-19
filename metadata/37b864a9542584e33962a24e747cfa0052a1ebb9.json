She tells him that she'll be leaving Minnesota to stay with him. Chris had left Anna 15 years ago to be raised by relatives who live on a farm in the countryside of St. Paul.

In order to survive, she has worked in a brothel for two years.

Anna and Matt soon fall in love with one another and Anna has the best days of her life. However, when Matt proposes to marry her, she is reluctant and haunted by her recent past. Matt insists and compels Anna to tell him the truth. She opens her heart to Matt and her father, disclosing the dark secrets of her past.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: German\nRunTime 85 mins\nSubtitles: Hard Coded English\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 85 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b864a9542584e33962a24e747cfa0052a1ebb9","amp;dn":"Anna+Christie+%281930%29+Xvid+1cd+-+German+Version+-+Greta+Garbo%2C+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b864a9542584e33962a24e747cfa0052a1ebb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,184,100,169,84,37,132,227,57,98,162,78,116,124,250,0,82,161,235,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
