They range from founding father Dick Dale to its most popular bands, the Surfaris, Belairs, Ventures, and Chantays. \nWhile not particularly a hardcore surf collection, this disc certainly outlines its virtues, and the tunes were long enough to display guitar proficiency, but short enough to prevent self-indulgence and repetition.
