The book contains real-life examples of how a subtle change in cell components can have a considerable effect on cellâ€™s performance. Examples are supported with approachable basic science commentaries.\r\n\r\nProviding a unique combination of practical know-how with an in-depth perspective, this book will appeal to graduate students, young faculty members, or others interested in the current research and development trends in lithium-ion technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb379bd377ebc3e122b754008b154406d5b259d","amp;dn":"Lithium-ion+Battery+Materials+and+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb379bd377ebc3e122b754008b154406d5b259d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,179,121,189,55,126,188,62,18,43,117,64,8,177,84,64,109,91,37,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
