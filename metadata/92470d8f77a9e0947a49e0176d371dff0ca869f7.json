The audience is rowdy and loud and the \r\ngroup feed off of this to offer a killer show, with some of the best \r\nplaying ever, and surely the best live version of Heartbreaker ever \r\nplayed. The audience recording captures the energetic atmosphere \r\nperfectly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92470d8f77a9e0947a49e0176d371dff0ca869f7","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1970.03.07+Montreux%2C+Switzerland+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92470d8f77a9e0947a49e0176d371dff0ca869f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,71,13,143,119,169,224,148,122,73,224,23,109,55,29,255,12,168,105,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
