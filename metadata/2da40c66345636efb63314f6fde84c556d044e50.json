Co-leaders Jamie \nDailey and Darrin Vincent have already had a profound impact on much of the \nbest modern bluegrass via their contributions to such estimable performers as \nDoyle Lawson &amp; Quicksilver, Ricky Skaggs &amp; Kentucky Thunder, and Rhonda \nVincent &amp; The Rage. Stepping out on their own for the first time, Dailey &amp; \nVincent make breathtaking music that seamlessly connects country music&amp;#039;s \nroots in brother duet singing to its future in exhilarating, full-throttle \nbluegrass - without ever sacrificing heart, sincerity, and soul.\n\n&quot;Even before one note of their stunning record had been heard, the pair \nearned a standing ovation at the 2007 International Bluegrass Music \nAssociation convention and were booked for more than 100 shows. Now that \nthe album is here, the advance accolades are completely understandable. \nThis is music that can stand side by side with any of the most revered \nbluegrass discs ever made.&quot; - from the liner notes by Robert K. Oermann\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da40c66345636efb63314f6fde84c556d044e50","amp;dn":"Dailey+and+Vincent+-+Dailey+and+Vincent+%5B2008%2FVBR162%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2da40c66345636efb63314f6fde84c556d044e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,164,12,102,52,86,54,239,182,51,20,246,253,232,76,85,109,4,78,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
