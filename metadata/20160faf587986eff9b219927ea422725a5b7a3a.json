Advanced lighting controls, indicated by research as the &quot;next big thing,&quot; are now mandated by the ASHRAE/IES 91.1-1999 energy standard, the basis for all state energy codes in the U.S., and are becoming the norm rather than the exception in new construction. This book provides in-depth information about the major trends, technologies, codes, and design techniques shaping the use of today's lighting control systems, including dimming, automatic switching, and global as well as personal control.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20160faf587986eff9b219927ea422725a5b7a3a","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2005%5D+Advanced+Lighting+Controls+Energy+Savings%2C+Producti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20160faf587986eff9b219927ea422725a5b7a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,22,15,175,88,121,134,239,249,178,25,146,126,164,34,114,90,91,122,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
