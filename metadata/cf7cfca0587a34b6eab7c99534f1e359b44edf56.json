Applying the same objective criteria to legal and illegal substances, an argument is made that legality is not a clear measure for harm. Tackling a variety of questions, such as Which is more harmfulÃ¢â‚¬â€Ecstasy or alcohol? Can addiction be cured? and Does the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; have serious unintended effects that can hurt children?, this analysis equips readers with the ability to make educated decisions regarding drugs both personally and in their communities. Broadening the scope of the discussion, a framework is explored for formulating national drug policies that will minimize a myriad of harmsÃ¢â‚¬â€social, medical, criminal, financial, and environmental.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://books.google.com/books?isbn=1906860165&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://books.google.com/books?isbn=1906860165&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.drugscience.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.drugscience.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: I didn't create this file or torrent, I've just added some trackers and piggybacked it over here to boost the swarm and lengthen its availability.
