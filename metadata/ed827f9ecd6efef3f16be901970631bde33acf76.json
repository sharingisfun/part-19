With both bassist and drummer positions now having greater significance, Iommi recruited the skills of Dave ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe BeastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Spitz and drummer Eric Singer (later of Kiss renown) and for the first time the position of a keyboardist became a visible credit and long-serving back-room operator, Geoff Nicholls was finally brought to the foreground as an official member. However, it would be the position of lead vocalist that would have the greatest impact upon the new Sabbath sound and the appointment of ex. Trapeze and Deep Purple bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, set interest and expectations high.\n\nBut regardless of what these new recruits would bring to the melting pot, musically, this new Black Sabbath album would be somewhat of a departure from what was expected from the name. Iommi had obviously been writing to please his personal musical palette and not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“to orderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for the Black Sabbath fan-base. As such, the songs on Seventh Star are more blues inclined and in the case of the single release, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“No Stranger To LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, an altogether more AOR and radio friendly breeze is adopted.\n\nThere but for the grace of god, the twelfth official Black Sabbath studio album was released on 28th January 1986. Inevitably reviews were mixed but die-hard Sabs took the record to the number 27 position in the UK and number 78 in the US.\n\nThis re-mastered Deluxe Expanded Edition of the album adds the US Remix of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“No Stranger To LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ single and also for the very first time on CD, a live performance from LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hammersmith Odeon in June ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢86 which features then unknown American singer, Ray Gillen on lead vocals who was brought-in to complete the tour following the departure of Glenn Hughes due to illness.\n\nDon't be shy!

Share your thoughts now...\n\nKnown worldwide as the embodiment of heavy metal, England's Black Sabbath enveloped the 1970s in a dense fog of apocalyptic imagery, monolithic guitar riffs, and horror-movie lyrics. When frontman Ozzy Osbourne left the band in 1979 for a highly successful solo career, the band soldiered on with a number of replacements, including Rainbow's Ronnie James Dio. In 1997, Ozzy and his former bandmates staged a much-publicized reunion. In the 2000s, when Ozzy got busy with solo recordings, Ozzfest, and his reality show THE OSBOURNES, Dio stepped in once again to front another incarnation of the band.\n\n\n\nDisc One\n\n* 1.
