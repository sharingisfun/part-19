Deliriously, delightfully, delectably happy. Her junior year in college, while not without some major issues, is turning out better than she ever dreamed. She's finally found closure to a question that has bothered her for as long as she can remember. She's even been able to put some serious distance between herself and her twisted mother. Best of all, she's in love with the hot, handsome, and mysterious Logan Walker.\nIf only she could share with Logan the one thing she must keep secret. The one relationship that, if he finds out about it, will blow apart everything that brings her happiness.\nEven as Ellie and Logan learn to open up to each other, even as they get closer than they've ever gotten to anyone else before, the reckless secrets they're holding on to may just be the thread that unravels everything. \n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60dd2b9512ed5e63aa1a09bf7a95a429d18414cd","amp;dn":"Reckless+Secrets+-+Gina+Robinson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60dd2b9512ed5e63aa1a09bf7a95a429d18414cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,221,43,149,18,237,94,99,170,26,9,191,122,149,164,41,209,132,20,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
