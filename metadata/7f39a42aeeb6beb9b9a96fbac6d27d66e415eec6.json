In A Matter of Life, Jeffrey Brown draws upon memories of three generations of Brown men: himself, his minister father, and his preschooler son Oscar. Weaving through time, passing through the quiet suburbs and colorful cities of the midwest, their stories slowly assemble into a kaleidoscopic answer to the big questions: matters of life and death, family and faith, and the search for something beyond oneself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f39a42aeeb6beb9b9a96fbac6d27d66e415eec6","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+Brown+-+A+Matter+Of+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f39a42aeeb6beb9b9a96fbac6d27d66e415eec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,57,164,42,238,182,190,185,185,169,111,186,198,210,125,102,228,21,238,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
