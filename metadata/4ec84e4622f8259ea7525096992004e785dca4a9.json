At the film's center is Blake Morrison himself, who for as long as he can remember has lived in the overarching shadow of his physician father, Arthur (Jim Broadbent) falling prey to feelings of embarrassment from the old man, as well as occasional awe. In the 1950s, when Blake (Bradley Johnson) was a child, the boy watched as Arthur partook in socially uncouth behavior such as wheedling his way into clubs to which he didn't belong, and carrying on an extramarital affair with the full knowledge of his wife, Kim (Juliet Stevenson). As the years passed, teenage Blake's (Matthew Beard) discomfort around his father hardened into resentment, particularly when the adolescent boy expressed interest in a girl, Rachel (Carey Mulligan), who clearly preferred his father; compounding the situation, Blake then had to suffer through Arthur's decision to publicly humiliate his son in front of everyone. The central dynamic has changed for the two, however, by the late '80s, when Blake, now married to Kathy (Gina McKee) and freshly established as a successful novelist and poet, learns that Arthur has contracted terminal cancer. Now, the junior Morrison takes a headfirst plunge into the memories and recollections of his youth and grapples with the dynamic of his relationship with Arthur for the first time in his life as he comes face to face with the need to provide loving care for the old man.\n\n************************************\n\n- Duration: 1h 32mn\n\n- Nominal bit rate: 1246 Kbps\n\n- Res: 1280 x 720\n\n- AR: 16:9\n\n- FPS: 23.976 fps\n\n- Audio: AAC, 2 channels, 128Kbps\n\n************************************\n\n\nGeneral\n------------\nFormat : Matroska\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\nFile size : 899 MiB\nDuration : 1h 32mn\nOverall bit rate : 1363 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2015-01-15 12:01:50\nWriting application : mkvmerge v7.5.0 ('Glass Culture') 64bit built on Jan 4 2015 16:48:44\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.1 + libmatroska v1.4.2\n\n\nVideo\n---------\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;632e020a0d232f574d53&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 1h 32mn\nNominal bit rate : 1246 Kbps\nWidth : 1280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.056\nWriting library : x264 core 142\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=4\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\n\nAudio\n----------\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : A_AAC\nDuration : 1h 32mn\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nTitle : Stereo\nLanguage : English\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ec84e4622f8259ea7525096992004e785dca4a9","amp;dn":"And+When+Did+You+Last+See+Your+Father+2007+720p+HDRip+x264+title","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ec84e4622f8259ea7525096992004e785dca4a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,200,78,70,34,248,37,158,167,82,80,150,153,32,4,231,133,220,164,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
