Always thought that Penn could make it big time but the commercial success he enjoyed, came with this one. The whole album is coherent collection of fine pop songs - well written tunes, with balanced harmonies and better than average lyrics (mostly about love, but hey this is pop music). Gems are &quot;No myth&quot;, &quot;This &amp; that&quot; and &quot;Cupid`s got a brand new gun&quot;. On the other hand there are no bad songs on the album. Good pop and fun, easy rock.  Penn can definitely write a hook and the band behind him is very tight.  Just a nice pleasant album. Not going to change the world, but I don&amp;#039;t need the world changed EVERY time I play a CD. Sometimes I just want to enjoy good music.\n\n01 No Myth 4:10 \n02 Half Harvest 4:05 \n03 This &amp; That 3:31 \n04 Brave New World 4:32 \n05 Innocent One 3:16 \n06 Disney&amp;#039;s a Snow Cone / Bedlam Boys 5:11 \n07 Invisible 3:45 \n08 Cupid&amp;#039;s Got a Brand New Gun 3:27 \n09 Big House 2:56 \n10 Battle Room 3:37 \n11 Evenfall 3:54 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26bdd8c316b5a3d914816db9fe1debe436908686","amp;dn":"Micheal+Penn+-+March+%5B1989%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26bdd8c316b5a3d914816db9fe1debe436908686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,189,216,195,22,181,163,217,20,129,109,185,254,29,235,228,54,144,134,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
