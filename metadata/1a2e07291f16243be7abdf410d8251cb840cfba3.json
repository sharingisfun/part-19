Equally strong was his determination to bring justice and freedom \nto a world terrorized by criminal violence and corruption. \n\nInigo's inspirational dreams, shared by hundreds of millions throughout \nthe galaxy-spanning gaiafield, gave birth to a religion---Living Dream. \nBut when the appearance of a Second Dreamer seemed to trigger the expansion \nof the Void---an expansion that is devouring everything in its path---the \nIntersolar Commonwealth was thrown into turmoil. With the adherents \nof Living Dream determined to set forth on a dangerous pilgrimage into \nthe Void, interstellar war threatens to erupt. \n\nWith time running out, the fate of humanity hinges on a handful of people. \nThere is Araminta, only now awakening to the unwelcome fact that she \nis the mysterious Second Dreamer---and to the dire responsibilities \nthat go with it; Inigo, whose private dreams hint at a darker truth \nbehind Edeard's legendary life; Paula Myo, the ruthless field operative \nof the Commonwealth, whose search for Araminta and Inigo is about to \nyield a most unpleasant surprise; and Justine, whose desperate gamble \nplaces her within the Void, where the godlike Skylords hold the power \nto save the universe...or destroy it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2e07291f16243be7abdf410d8251cb840cfba3","amp;dn":"The+Temporal+Void+by+Peter+F.+Hamilton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2e07291f16243be7abdf410d8251cb840cfba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,46,7,41,31,22,36,59,231,171,223,65,13,130,81,203,132,12,251,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
