In Venezuela, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sanctuaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that he chose to withdraw from the world for four long years, our killer reappears on the scene. What brought him back? Boredom, fatigue, the need for action? His old friend, Mariano, recommends him for a quick-and-dirty freelance job. Except that the job, obviously, is worse than it seemed at first. Remove one banker and one international oil broker, sure, no problem. But why is his third and final target a nun, Madre Luisa, so devoted, selfless and invested in her ministry to the poorest of the poor in all of Latin America? A perfect jumping-on spot for readers new to the series!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce6a8a95c01baa7a0eade28cb7af8d4c932f5ea","amp;dn":"The+Killer+Vol.+3+-++Modus+Vivendi+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce6a8a95c01baa7a0eade28cb7af8d4c932f5ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,230,168,169,92,1,186,167,160,234,222,40,203,122,248,212,201,50,245,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
