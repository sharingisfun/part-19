Graduate students can learn here the terminology and scope of the field, and animal fanciers can discover the genetics behind common color variants of mammals. The book is hailed for being written by four of the premier scientists in the field. These authors aim to present the molecular /cellular work in the context of phenotype and the interacting functions of genes that direct the development and function of one biological system. For other researchers, the depth of genetic knowledge on the pigmantary system makes it a valuable model for the study of other systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f449ff62d1dfe7a6b97193bbd721528c7ba6bb70","amp;dn":"The+Colors+of+Mice%3A+A+Model+Genetic+Network","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f449ff62d1dfe7a6b97193bbd721528c7ba6bb70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,73,255,98,209,223,231,166,185,113,147,187,215,33,82,140,123,166,187,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
