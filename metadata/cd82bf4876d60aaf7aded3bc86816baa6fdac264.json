This release 1990 on Blue Note.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nThe Modern Jazz Quartet never actually recorded for Blue Note but their United Artists date was reissued on this Blue Note CD. The MJQ (vibraphonist Milt Jackson, pianist John Lewis, bassist Percy Heath and drummer Connie Kay) perform six of Lewis's compositions which were used in the film Odds Against Tomorrow. Best known is &quot;Skating in Central Park&quot; but all of the selections have their memorable moments and it is good to hear this classic unit playing such fresh material. \n\n01. Skating In Central Park   \n02. No Happiness For Slater   \n03. A Social Call   \n04. Cue #9   \n05. A Cold Wind Is Blowing   \n06. Odds Against Tomorrow   \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd82bf4876d60aaf7aded3bc86816baa6fdac264","amp;dn":"Modern+Jazz+Quartet+-+Odds+Against+Tomorrow+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd82bf4876d60aaf7aded3bc86816baa6fdac264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,130,191,72,118,214,10,175,122,222,211,188,134,129,107,170,111,218,194,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
