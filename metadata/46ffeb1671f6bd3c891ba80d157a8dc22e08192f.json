Generations of students have benefited from the teachings of this 19th-century master, who sought always to &quot;produce as near a likeness to Nature, in every respect, as the instrument, or material employed, will admit of; not so much by bona fide imitation, as by reviving in the mind those ideas which are awakened by a contemplation of Nature . . . The renewal of those feelings constitutes the true purpose of Art.&quot;\r\nThis volume consists of direct reproductions of Harding's sketches of vignettes from natural settings. Each is accompanied by a series of lessons emphasizing both practical and theoretical considerations. The edition features the added attraction of 23 outstanding plates from the author's Lessons on Trees","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46ffeb1671f6bd3c891ba80d157a8dc22e08192f","amp;dn":"On+Drawing+Trees+and+Nature+%282005%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46ffeb1671f6bd3c891ba80d157a8dc22e08192f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,255,235,22,113,246,189,60,137,27,168,13,21,122,141,194,46,8,25,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
