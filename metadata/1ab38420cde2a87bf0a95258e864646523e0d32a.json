To use, simply copy a URL and paste into the ScribdViewer.exe.\nIf you would like to use the built-in viewer (allows for printing PDFs),\nthen you will need the ActiveX (Internet Explorer) version of flash\nplayer and a PDF printer program. These are both included in the Extra\nfolder. If you only want to view the documents, you can just copy the\nlink generated by ScribdViewer.exe into your browser. If you try to\nprint from firefox, it will result in the flashplayer plugin crashing,\nso you need to use the built-in viewer.\n\nSettings.inf contains some brief info on how to generate the links from\nscribd. This may need to be updated periodically. I've included this to\nreduce the need for regular program updates.\n\nProgrammed by: Synaps3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab38420cde2a87bf0a95258e864646523e0d32a","amp;dn":"ScribdViewer+1.1+by+Synaps3+-+PDF+Blocked+Scribd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab38420cde2a87bf0a95258e864646523e0d32a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,179,132,32,205,226,168,123,240,169,82,88,232,100,100,101,35,224,211,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
