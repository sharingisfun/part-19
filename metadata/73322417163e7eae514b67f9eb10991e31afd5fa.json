These cuts have all been heard scattered about on various other albums going back to High Heeled Blues from 1989; here they are pulled together into one comprehensive whole. She explores the wide variety of country-blues, and even at 69-plus minutes this disc never gets repetitive. Except for five cuts, she is unaccompanied, and when she is, it only enhances what she does. Her youngest son, Jordan Block Valdina, helps out by doing the male vocal on a stunning a cappella version of &quot;Be Ready When He Comes.&quot; The harmonica backing by Little Annie Raines (a frequent collaborator with Paul Rishell) just perfectly walks that line of being enhancing without intruding. If you like country-blues, this is one you don't want to miss.
