The double album introduces her alter-ego &quot;Sasha Fierce&quot;. I Am... Sasha Fierce was also released as a deluxe edition, and later an accompanying remix album with videography, a platinum edition, and a re-release to celebrate one year since the album's first release. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 482,000 copies in its first week. Upon its release, I Am... Sasha Fierce received generally mixed to positive reviews from most music critics. It spawned five worldwide singles and earned Knowles five Grammy Awards at the 52nd Grammy Awards. To date, the album has sold over six million copies worldwide.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Danny McKenna - The latest outing from former Destiny's Child starlet BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is an intentionally schizophrenic affair. Splitting herself into two separate characters--herself and alter ego Sasha Fierce--is the artist's way of presenting what she obviously sees as an artistic duality. The first set, I Am..., is intended give a glimpse beneath the surface of her usual R&amp;B-pop persona. Featuring recent single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf I Was a Boy&quot;, the soaring ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHalo&quot;, and ballads like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDisappear&quot;, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAve Maria&quot;, it seems her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreal&quot; self is way more saccharine than the lady that brought us sassy pop moments like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCrazy in Love&quot; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaby Boy&quot;. That side of her personality comes rushing back out on Sasha Fierce, a more rousing collection that kicks off with the infectious handclaps of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSingle Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;, ventures into Euro-dance territory with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRadio&quot;, and gets surprisingly risque with the voyeuristic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVideo Phone&quot;. Which part of the album you enjoy most will depend on your musical proclivities, but the new, bifurcated BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ensures there's enough diversity to satisfy the most demanding pop aficionado.\n\nCD Listings\n\n[01] Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\n[02] Diva\n[03] Ego\n[04] Halo\n[05] If I Were A Boy\n[06] Smash Into You\n[07] Sweet Dreams\n[08] Broken-Hearted Girl\n[09] Scared Of Lonely\n[10] That's Why You're Beautiful\n[11] Hello\n[12] Radio\n[13] Video Phone\n[14] Ego (Remix)\t&gt; Featuring Kanye West\n[15] Why Don't You Love Me\n[16] Honesty\n[17] Save The Hero\n[18] Satellites\n[19] Disappear\n[20] Ave Maria\n \nVideo Listings\n\n[01] If I Were A Boy\n[02] Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\n[03] Diva\n[04] Halo\n[05] Broken-Hearted\n[06] Ego (Remix)\t&gt; Featuring Kanye West\n[07] Ego (Fan Exclusive)\n[08] Sweet Dreams\n[09] Behind The Scenes (The Videos)\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 01h:18m:17s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 1.03GB (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Mpeg\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; R&amp;B Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 08 November 2008 [Re-Issue 22 September 2009]\nRecord Company\t&gt; Sony Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.beyonceonline.com \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9_Knowles \n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/k/knowles.html \n\t&gt; www.ilike.com/artist/BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.bebo.com/beyonce \n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/beyonce \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt;[Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)]\n\t&gt;[If I Were A Boy]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d83d5e8d1461b3faad98270cbf5856f5f978bb88","amp;dn":"%5B2008%5D+I+Am...Sasha+Fierce+-+Beyonce+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d83d5e8d1461b3faad98270cbf5856f5f978bb88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,61,94,141,20,97,179,250,173,152,39,12,191,88,86,245,249,120,187,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
