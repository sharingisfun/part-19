High-publicity cases about foodborne illnesses over recent years have heightened public awareness of food safety issues, and momentum has been building to find new ways to detect and identify foodborne pathogens and eliminate food-related infections and intoxications. This extensively revised 4e covers how the incidence and impact of foodborne diseases is determined, foodborne intoxications with an introduction noting common features among these diseases and control measures that are applicable before and after the basic foodstuff is harvested.\n\nBrief Contents\nList of Contributors.........xxiii\nPreface......................xxix\nPreface to the Third Edition.....................xxxi\nDedication...................xxxiii\nSECTION 1 FOODBORNE DISEASE: EPIDEMIOLOGY AND DISEASE BURDEN\nSECTION 2 FOODBORNE INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL\nSECTION 3 FOODBORNE INFECTIONS: VIRAL\nSECTION 4 FOODBORNE INFECTIONS: PARASITES AND OTHERS\nSECTION 5 INTOXICATIONS\nSECTION 6 POLICY AND PREVENTION OF FOODBORNE DISEASES\nIndex.........................529","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bd0270bc770a0c0d9cecfb63e9bfa7f0c437c93","amp;dn":"Foodborne+Infections+and+Intoxications+%284th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bd0270bc770a0c0d9cecfb63e9bfa7f0c437c93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,208,39,11,199,112,160,192,217,206,207,182,62,155,250,127,12,67,124,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
