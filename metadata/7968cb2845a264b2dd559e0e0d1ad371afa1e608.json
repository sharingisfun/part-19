Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ might not be an ideal keynote song but it is certainly one of FloydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature songs, something that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be said of every one of the 16 songs here, the oddest choices being Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Happiest Days of Our LivesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (used as an extended intro for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Fletcher Memorial HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (an album cut from the un-beloved The Final Cut). Apart from these tunes, A Foot in the Door serves up the expected -- five cuts from Dark Side of the Moon, three from Wish You Were Here, four from The Wall (of the big radio staples, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Run Like HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Young LustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are absent), adding the early Syd Barrett Ã¢â‚¬Å“See Emily PlayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the latter-day Ã¢â‚¬Å“High HopesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Learning to FlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ almost as afterthoughts. Although the compilation could withstand some minor tweaks -- a post-Syd song like Ã¢â‚¬Å“One of These DaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ would have been welcome, for instance -- this is still a very worthy compilation of (most of) the Floyd songs everybody knows by heart.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
