Although none of his four originals (&quot;Workout,&quot; &quot;Uh Huh,&quot; &quot;Smokin',&quot; &quot;Greasin' Easy&quot;) caught on, the fine saxophonist is in top form. He jams on the four tunes, plus &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free,&quot; with an all-star quintet of young modernists -- guitarist Grant Green, pianist Wynton Kelly, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones -- and shows that he was a much stronger player than his then-current boss Miles Davis seemed to think.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01. Workout\n 02. Uh Huh\n 03. Smokin'\n 04. The Best Things In Life Are Free\n 05. Greasin' Easy\n 06. Three Coins In The Fountain\n\nPerfectly played on Foobar2000 with &quot;foo_input_sacd&quot; plugin.\n For those Mac users wishing to play ISO, SACD format: see Audirvana Plus\n - Make sure you've configured it properly (check up the player settings).\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae36e354ad9b2a1b5933eaed3adad6a3b8b66037","amp;dn":"Hank+Mobley+-+Workout+%281962%29+%5BAPO+Remaster+2011%5D+SACD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae36e354ad9b2a1b5933eaed3adad6a3b8b66037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,54,227,84,173,155,42,27,89,51,234,237,58,218,214,163,184,182,96,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
