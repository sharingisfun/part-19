At the center of this change are Apple and Google, two companies whose philosophies, leaders, and commercial acumen have steamrolled the competition. In the age of the Android and the iPad, these corporations are locked in a feud that will play out not just in the marketplace but in the courts and on screens around the world.\n     \nFred Vogelstein has reported on this rivalry for more than a decade and has rare access to its major players. In Dogfight, he takes us into the offices and board rooms where company dogma translates into ruthless business; behind outsize personalities like Steve Jobs, AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now-lionized CEO, and Eric Schmidt, GoogleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s executive chairman; and inside the deals, lawsuits, and allegations that mold the way we communicate. Apple and Google are poaching each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s employees. They bid up the price of each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acquisitions for spite, and they forge alliances with major players like Facebook and Microsoft in pursuit of market dominance.\n     \nDogfight reads like a novel: vivid nonfiction with never-before-heard details. This is more than a story about what devices will replace our phones and laptops. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about who will control the content on those devices and where that content will come fromÃ¢â‚¬â€about the future of media in Silicon Valley, New York, and Hollywood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b5b6e7cfc54de2563074cd7fb2aa5c7868c678d","amp;dn":"Dogfight+-+How+Apple+and+Google+Went+To+War+and+Started+A+Revolu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b5b6e7cfc54de2563074cd7fb2aa5c7868c678d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,91,110,124,252,84,222,37,99,7,76,215,251,42,165,199,134,140,103,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
