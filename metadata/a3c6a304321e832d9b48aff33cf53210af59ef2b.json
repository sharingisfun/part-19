When that post is viewed, your affiliate link is quietly \nand invisibly called in the background.\n\nThe visitor has no idea that this is happening - all they see \nis a plain text link that you add to your post. After all, \nthere's no need to make your affiliate link publicly visible \nwithin the post any more, as the visitor to your blog has \nalready been cookied.\n\nAs far as they're concerned, you've written a product review \nwith no intent of financial gain, and they're ready to go through \nto the site and buy.\n\nCookies Bomber is very easy to use. Just upload and \nactivate the plugin, then go to the Cookies Bomber settings page.\n\nOnce you're there you can add your affiliate links to as \nmany posts or pages as you like.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3c6a304321e832d9b48aff33cf53210af59ef2b","amp;dn":"Wordpress+Cookie+Bomber+WP+Plugin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3c6a304321e832d9b48aff33cf53210af59ef2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,198,163,4,50,30,131,45,155,72,175,243,60,245,50,16,175,89,239,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
