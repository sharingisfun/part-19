On this CD reissue of his final Prestige date, Allison (in a trio with bassist Addison Farmer and drummer Ronnie Free) performs seven instrumentals ( including &quot;It's Crazy,&quot; &quot;Autumn Song&quot; and &quot;Groovin' High&quot; ) but it is the three vocals ( &quot;Eyesight To The Blind,&quot; &quot;That's All Right&quot; and Duke Ellington's &quot;Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me&quot; ) that are most memorable.  One realizes why Allison was soon emphasizing his vocals; he was a much more distinctive singer than pianist although his piano playing was actually pretty inventive.  This is an excellent all-round set. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nMose Allison (Piano and Vocal) \nAddison Farmer (Double Bass) \nRonnie Free (Drums) \n\nMose Allison - Autumn Song Tracks:\n01  Promenade (Mose Allison) 4:12 \n02  Eyesight To The Blind (Sonny Boy Williamson) 1:43 \n03  It's Crazy (Dorothy Fields/Richard Rodgers) 3:40 \n04  That's All Right (Jimmy Rogers) 2:28 \n05  Devil In The Cane Field (Mose Allison) 4:05 \n06  Strange (Matthew Fisher/John Latouche) 3:08 \n07  Autumn Song (Mose Allison) 3:43 \n08  Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me (Duke Ellington/Bob Russell) 3:13 \n09  Spires (Mose Allison) 3:05 \n10  Groovin' High (Dizzy Gillespie) 5:38","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8883b7746046874bad06cea5506fac4d5d65750b","amp;dn":"Mose+Allison+-+Autumn+Song+%281959%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8883b7746046874bad06cea5506fac4d5d65750b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,131,183,116,96,70,135,75,173,6,206,165,80,111,172,77,93,101,117,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
