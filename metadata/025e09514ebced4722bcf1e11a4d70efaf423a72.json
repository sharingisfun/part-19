Nathan Harris on his most difficult mission: coming home after being seriously wounded in Afghanistan. Embedded with Harris's unit during their assault on a Taliban stronghold, Dennis brilliantly toggles between the intense experience of war, stunningly photographed by the director himself, and the challenges of re-adjusting to civilian life in small town North Carolina. Hell and Back Again brings the war home in ways that make gun-toting soldiering look like a day at the beach compared with the physical and psychic scars that manifest upon returning home","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:025e09514ebced4722bcf1e11a4d70efaf423a72","amp;dn":"Hell+And+Back+Again++2011+BDRIP+XVID-WBZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"025e09514ebced4722bcf1e11a4d70efaf423a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,94,9,81,78,188,237,71,34,188,241,225,26,77,112,239,175,66,58,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
