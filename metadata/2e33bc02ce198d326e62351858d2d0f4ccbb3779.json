But within minutes of his arrival, Ethan is involved in a violent accident. He comes to in a hospital, with no ID, no cell phone, and no briefcase. The medical staff seems friendly enough, but something feelsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦off. As the days pass, EthanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation into the disappearance of his colleagues turns up more questions than answers. Why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t he get any phone calls through to his wife and son in the outside world? Why doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t anyone believe he is who he says he is? And what is the purpose of the electrified fences surrounding the town? Are they meant to keep the residents in? Or something else out? Each step closer to the truth takes Ethan further from the world he thought he knew, from the man he thought he was, until he must face a horrifying factÃ¢â‚¬â€he may never get out of Wayward Pines alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e33bc02ce198d326e62351858d2d0f4ccbb3779","amp;dn":"Pines+By+Blake+Crouch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e33bc02ce198d326e62351858d2d0f4ccbb3779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,51,188,2,206,25,141,50,110,98,53,24,88,210,208,244,204,187,55,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
