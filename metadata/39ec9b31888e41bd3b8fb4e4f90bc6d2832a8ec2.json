Plenty of horns and steel drums accompany songs like &quot;Majesty,&quot; and &quot;Lord I Lift Your Name on High&quot; contains a guitar sound not unlike that found on some of Jimmy Buffett's fun tunes.  If you are intrigued by the sound of reggae music but had trouble finding any that was spiritually-edifying, check out this.\n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ec9b31888e41bd3b8fb4e4f90bc6d2832a8ec2","amp;dn":"Christafari+-+1999+-+The+First+Fruit+of+Christafari","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39ec9b31888e41bd3b8fb4e4f90bc6d2832a8ec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,236,155,49,136,142,65,189,59,143,180,228,249,11,198,210,131,42,142,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
