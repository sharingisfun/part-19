Now theyâ€™ll pursue him across the whole Wild West, fighting their way through hordes of bandits, bears, braves and boogeymen just to find Boon and repay their debt withâ€¦ A FISTFUL OF GUN!\r\nSelect one of eleven unique playable gunslingers and seek revenge as a lone wolf or with up to eight other bandits in local and online co-op. Master the specialized controls of each character, collect gold from fallen foes to purchase upgrades, and imbibe a bit of liquid courage and unleash a tornado of lead across the dusty plains.\r\nMisfits and Outlaws: Choose between eleven different gunslingers each with their own unique control scheme and methods of attack to master.
