Richard Benjamin (who later went on to star in another Roth adaptation, PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT) makes his film debut as Neil Klugman, a poor librarian from the Bronx who falls in love with Jewish American Princess Brenda Patimkin (Ali MacGraw, also making her film debut). The cross-class love affair displeases Brenda's well-to-do Westchester family and Neil soon finds himself plunged into a maelstrom of class snobbery and elitism that threatens to overwhelm the relationship.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064381/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064381/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91b7bc918579583ba08df703c19b52f94313d77c","amp;dn":"Goodbye+Columbus+Dvdrip+H264+Bookerdog.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91b7bc918579583ba08df703c19b52f94313d77c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,183,188,145,133,121,88,59,160,141,247,3,193,155,82,249,67,19,215,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
