Edward LarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic, Summer for the Gods, received the Pulitzer Prize in History in 1998 and is the single most authoritative account of a pivotal event whose combatants remain at odds in school districts and courtrooms. For this edition, Larson has added a new preface that assesses the state of the battle between creationism and evolution, and points the way to how it might potentially be resolved.\n\n2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45881906c08f754c0dee85de72f57a623cfa0129","amp;dn":"Summer+for+the+Gods%3A+The+Scopes+Trial+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45881906c08f754c0dee85de72f57a623cfa0129","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,136,25,6,192,143,117,76,13,238,133,222,114,245,122,98,60,250,1,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
