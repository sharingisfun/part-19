In this book, the celebrated writer Mr. Fox can't stop himself:\n : from killing off the heroines of his novels, and neither can his wife,     :\n : Daphne. It's not until Mary, his muse, comes to life and transforms him    :\n : from author into subject that his story begins to unfold differently.      :\n :                                                                            :\n : Mary challenges Mr. Fox to join her in stories of their own devising; and  :\n : in different times and places, the two of them seek each other, find each  :\n : other, thwart each other, and try to stay together, even when the roles    :\n : they inhabit seem to forbid it. Their adventures twist the fairy tale into :\n : nine variations, exploding and teasing conventions of genre and romance,   :\n : and each iteration explores the fears that come with accepting a lifelong  :\n : bond. Meanwhile, Daphne becomes convinced that her husband is having an    :\n : affair, and finds her way into Mary and Mr. Fox's game. And so Mr. Fox is  :\n : offered a choice:                                                          :\n : Will it be a life with the girl of his dreams, or a life with an           :\n : all-too-real woman who delights him more than he cares to admit?           :\n :                                                                            :\n : The extraordinarily gifted Helen Oyeyemi has written a love story like no  :\n : other. Mr. Fox is a magical book, endlessly inventive, as witty and        :\n : charming as it is profound in its truths about how we learn to be with one :\n : another.                                                                   :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd8a2f77fcc14534569a57d7aa9df499853510db","amp;dn":"Helen+Oyeyemi+Mr+Fox+2011+Retail+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd8a2f77fcc14534569a57d7aa9df499853510db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,138,47,119,252,193,69,52,86,154,87,215,170,157,244,153,133,53,16,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
