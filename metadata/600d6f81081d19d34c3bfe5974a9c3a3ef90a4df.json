What formed this merciless psychopath who was, as well, a consummate politician, the dynamic world statesman who helped create and industrialize the USSR, outplayed Churchill and Roosevelt, organized Stalingrad, took Berlin and defeated Hitler?\n\nYoung Stalin tells the story of a charismatic, darkly turbulent boy born into poverty, of doubtful parentage, scarred by his upbringing but possessed of unusual talents. Admired as a romantic poet and trained as a priestÃ¢â‚¬â€both by the time he was in his early twentiesÃ¢â‚¬â€he found his true mission as a fanatical revolutionary. A mastermind of bank robbery, protection rackets, arson, piracy and murder, he was equal parts terrorist, intellectual and brigand. Here is the dramatic story of his friendships and hatreds, his many love affairsÃ¢â‚¬â€with women from every social stratum and age groupÃ¢â‚¬â€his illegitimate children and his complicated relationship with the Tsarist secret police. Here is Stalin the arch-conspirator and escape artist whose brutal ingenuity so impressed Lenin that Lenin made him, along with Trotsky, top henchman. Montefiore makes clear how the paranoid criminal underworld was StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s natural habitat, and how murderous Caucasian banditry and political gangsterism, combined with pitiless ideology, enabled Stalin to dominate the KremlinÃ¢â‚¬â€and create the USSR in his flawed image.\n\nBased on ten years of research in newly opened archives in Russia and Georgia, Young StalinÃ¢â‚¬â€companion to the prizewinning Stalin: The Court of the Red TsarÃ¢â‚¬â€is a brilliant prehistory of the USSR, a chronicle of the Revolution, and an intimate biography. A thrilling work of history, unparalleled in its scope, full of astonishing new evidence and utterly fascinating: this is how Stalin became Stalin.\n\n496 pages\nPublisher: Knopf; 1ST edition (October 16, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1400044650\nISBN-13: 978-1400044658","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:600d6f81081d19d34c3bfe5974a9c3a3ef90a4df","amp;dn":"Young+Stalin+%282007%29+by+Simon+Sebag+Montefiore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"600d6f81081d19d34c3bfe5974a9c3a3ef90a4df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,13,111,129,8,29,25,211,76,59,254,89,116,169,195,163,239,144,164,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
