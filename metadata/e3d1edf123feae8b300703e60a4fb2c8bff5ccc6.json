They're much worse. But there's also plenty that we can do about it.\n\nAs oil pricesÃ¢â‚¬â€and public outrageÃ¢â‚¬â€skyrocket, Antonia Juhasz, a leading industry critic and expert on corporations and globalization, gives us the hardest-hitting exposÃƒÂ© of the oil industry in decades. In The Tyranny of Oil she investigates the true state of the U.S. oil industryÃ¢â‚¬â€uncovering its virtually unparalleled global power, influence over our elected officials, and lack of regulatory oversight, as well as the truth behind $150-a-barrel oil, $4.50-a-gallon gasoline, and the highest profit in corporate history. Exposing an industry that thrives on secrecy, Juhasz shows how Big Oil manages to hide its business dealings from policy makers, legislators, and, most of all, consumers. She reveals exactly how Big Oil gets what it wantsÃ¢â‚¬â€through money, influence, and lies.
