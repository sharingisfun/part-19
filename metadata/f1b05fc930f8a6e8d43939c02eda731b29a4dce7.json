Got your FPL card?\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nMy Life As a Man is American writer Philip Roth's seventh novel. The \nwork is split into two sections: the first section, &quot;Useful Fictions,&quot; \nconsisting of two short stories about a character named Nathan Zuckerman \n(although this character frequently featured in Roth's later novels, \nscholarship has revealed this not to be the same character), and the \nsecond section, &quot;My True Story,&quot; which takes the form of a first-person \nmemoir by Peter Tarnopol, a Jewish writer who authored the two stories \nin the first section.\n\nMy Life As a Man is the first of Roth's work that tackles the issue of \nthe writer's relationship to his work, a theme he would develop in \nsubsequent novels, particularly Operation Shylock. In his autobiography, \nRoth reveals that much of Tarnopol's life is based on his own \nexperiences; for example, Roth's destructive marriage to Margaret \nMartinson, which is portrayed through Tarnopol's relationship with the \ncharacter of Maureen.\n - - -\n\nA fiction-within-a-fiction, a labyrinthine edifice of funny, mournful, \nand harrowing meditations on the fatal impasse between a man and a \nwoman, My Life as a Man is Roth's most blistering novel. At its heart \nlies the marriage of Peter and Maureen Tarnopol, a gifted young writer \nand the woman who wants to be his muse but who instead is his nemesis. \nTheir union is based on fraud and shored up by moral blackmail, but it \nis so perversely durable that, long after Maureen's death, Peter is \nstill tryingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and failingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to write his way free of it. Out of desperate \ninventions and cauterizing truths, acts of weakness, tenderheartedness, \nand shocking cruelty, Philip Roth creates a work worthy of StrindbergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a \nfierce tragedy of sexual need and blindness.\n - - -\n\nFrom BrillianceAudio.fail\n\nAt its heart lies the marriage of Peter and Maureen Tarnopol, a gifted \nyoung writer and the woman who wants to be his muse but who instead is \nhis nemesis.
