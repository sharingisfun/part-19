There was a mixture of music from not just Namlook, but also from the numerous other artists and collaborators on the label. Now, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the label, the Ambient Cookbook II has been released. Comparisons with the original release are of course inevitable, but in reality this new 4 CD set is something entirely new. Whilst still featuring an excellent selection of music from Fax, the majority of the tracks are by Namlook or Namlook &amp; Collaborators. The only non-Namlook tracks are Atom's &quot;Tuff Transmitter&quot;, Inoue's &quot;Magnetic Field&quot; and Jochem Paap's &quot;Dx Synth&quot;. Overall, this is a highly recommended release, which would serve as a good introduction to the label. In the main though, it is a worthwhile part of any Fax devotee's collection. Familiar tracks are put together in a new context, so even if you do have most or all of the original releases, this is still worth getting.
