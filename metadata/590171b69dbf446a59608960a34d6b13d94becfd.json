The main focus here is NES and SNES sound files in NFS and SPC format, in multiple redundant collections which each have their own unique advantages and each of which is available on the net from various sites.  The SID files are audio from Commodore 64 games.\n\nTogether with the MIDI files, the collection spans music produced by Nintendo, Sega, Sony, and many more companies, for NES, SNES, Playstation, and many more consoles; as well as music from games for C64, PC, Amiga, and Apple computers.  The MIDI collection is not titled consistently however, so to figure out which files go to which games you may need to consult the included html files or go to www.vgmusic.com where the files came from.\n\nIf you are looking for individual SPC files not a collection you may want to try this torrent: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://snesmusic.org/v2/torrent.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://snesmusic.org/v2/torrent.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou may also wish to check out this torrent if all you are only interested in NSF files, though it is slightly older: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3637746/NSF_(NES_Sound_Format)_Collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3637746/NSF_(NES_Sound_Format)_Collection&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can also find the GoodPSID and GoodSPC files here:\n\n\n-----\n\nHere are some of the sites where you can find these files and get regular updates, or contribute to the collections yourself:\n\nVGmusic\nhttp://www.vgmusic.com/\n\nSlick Productions\nhttp://slickproductions.org\n\nThe NES Music Archive (homebrew)\nhttp://2a03.org/\n\nAkumu's NSF Archive\nhttp://akumunsf.good-evil.net/\n\nHigh Voltage SID Collection\nhttp://hvsc.c64.org/\n\nSNESMusic.org\nhttp://snesmusic.org/\n\nUnderground Gamer\nhttp://www.underground-gamer.com/\n\nKevin Horton's NFS Collection\nhttp://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/nes/nsf.html\n\nZohpar's Doman\nhttp://www.zophar.net/\n\n-----\n\nEnjoy!\n\nFluxcapacitor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:590171b69dbf446a59608960a34d6b13d94becfd","amp;dn":"Game.Audio.NES.SNES.C64.ETC.PC.NSF.SPC.SID.MIDI.Fluxcapacitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"590171b69dbf446a59608960a34d6b13d94becfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,1,113,182,157,191,68,106,89,96,137,96,163,77,107,19,217,75,236,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
