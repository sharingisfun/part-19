It was all one big WAV file so \n\nI had to slice it up as individual tracks. Added all the metadata myself :)\n\nAlbum cover is inside the archive, I forgot to put it inside the actual folder but \n\nyou can just drag and drop it in with the songs. There is one minor issue: Ã¢â‚¬Å“F Wit Dre \n\nDayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has the left channel kinda messed up for the beginning of the song and then \n\ncorrects itself. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had this problem before with other versions of The Chronic, I \n\nthink itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a bad master. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only caveat that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m aware of. \n\nPlease seed and enjoy.\n\n-edm6013 (a.k.a synthy)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44f3c123afb5b256fdd7eaf182bca5f5fe024782","amp;dn":"Dr.+Dre+-+The+Chronic+-+DualDisc+Enhanced+Stereo+24+bit+FLAC+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44f3c123afb5b256fdd7eaf182bca5f5fe024782","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,243,193,35,175,181,178,86,253,215,234,241,130,188,165,245,254,2,71,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
