Elvis doesn't look as good as before in it but his singing is better than ever. There is some great performances including 'An American Trilogy' and 'Johnny B. Goode'. It's amusing but ends sad. It was the last film by Elvis Presley and his only one to win an award. The rock 'n' roll is great on this video including his early songs including 'Blue suede shoes'. There is a great version of 'Love me Tender' and clips from his movies and this is what makes it sad , looking back on when Elvis looked better.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068537/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068537/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nenjoy! ;D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5125ebb9a40cf4678a0a57cca41fc6d1e59af43d","amp;dn":"Elvis.Presley.on.Tour.1972","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5125ebb9a40cf4678a0a57cca41fc6d1e59af43d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,37,235,185,164,12,244,103,138,10,87,204,164,31,198,209,229,154,244,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
