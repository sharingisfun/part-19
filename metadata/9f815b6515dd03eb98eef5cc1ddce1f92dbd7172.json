At the rejuvenation clinics of Lord Julius Stileman, anyone can experience the prime years of their youth once more. However, the treatment will cost you everything you own, and the minimum price is one million bucks. Because the treatment only lasts ten years, after the procedure is complete there begins a deadly race against the clock.
