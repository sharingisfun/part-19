Brian and Elizabeth need a loan to pay off Ã‚Â£26,000 they've spent on seven credit cards. Farid, who came to Britain from Afghanistan aged 17, wants a small mortgage to buy his council flat. And John wants a loan of half a million pounds for his luxury housing development.\n\nClare's branch of NatWest in Huddersfield has an annual profit target to hit and in six months the bank will announce whether or not it's made a profit for the first time since the banking crash seven years ago.\n\nMortgage advisor Gary is trying to drum up new business with a giant coffee cup while customer advisor Richard is trying to take his own advice, stop over-spending and resist the temptation of buying a remote controlled drone on eBay.\n\nThe final episode of this series - with unique, behind the scenes access to a high street bank and its customers - looks at how we borrow money and how banks lend it. Will Claire and her team help bring the bank into profit for the first time in years? The bank needs to lend money to make money, but why do we borrow so much?\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/veuKhLnjQG.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/dGoTEy2b4P.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:165f8b3c071fb1f08c768a60a31243bb7dfbaee5","amp;dn":"The+Bank+A+Matter+of+Life+and+Debt+s01e03+ENG+SUBS+WEBRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"165f8b3c071fb1f08c768a60a31243bb7dfbaee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,95,139,60,7,31,177,240,140,118,138,96,163,18,67,187,125,251,174,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
