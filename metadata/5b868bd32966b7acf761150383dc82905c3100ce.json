Seborg, Duncan A. Mellichamp, Thomas F. Edgar, Francis J. Doyle III (Wiley, 2011).pdf\n\nISBN 9780470128671\n\nThis third edition provides chemical engineers with process control techniques that are used in practice while offering detailed mathematical analysis. Numerous examples and simulations are used to illustrate key theoretical concepts. New exercises are integrated throughout several chapters to reinforce concepts. Up-to-date information is also included on real-time optimization and model predictive control to highlight the significant impact these techniques have on industrial practice. And chemical engineers will find two new chapters on biosystems control to gain the latest perspective in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b868bd32966b7acf761150383dc82905c3100ce","amp;dn":"Process+Dynamics+and+Control+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b868bd32966b7acf761150383dc82905c3100ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,134,139,211,41,102,183,172,247,97,21,3,131,220,130,144,92,49,0,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
