This admirably thorough compilation--part of Bear Family's excellent series of rockabilly retrospectives--contains four CDs' worth of music, as well as a hardbound 104-page book with photos and notes. This makes a nice companion piece to Bear Family's box set of later recordings.\n\n\nLet's Think About Living - His Recordings 1955-1967 BCD 16259 DL This four CD boxed set contains all of Bob LumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recordings from 1955-1967. The Texas-native graced many labels during this period including Abbott, Imperial, Capitol, Warner Brothers, and Hickory Records. The 117 tracks includes 8 unissued masters - many in stereo for the first time - and all of his quintessential rockabilly staples. LumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story is told in a remarkably well-researched 104-page hardcover book that features amazing unpublished photos. The essay, written by the incomparable Hank Davis, augments articles published during the singerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and interviews with the man himself with previously unpublished interviews with key players in LumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal life and career. Fresh insights are provided by LumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow Barbara, daughter Melissa, close friends Bobby and Jeannie Bare, rockabilly legend Mac Curtis, guitar god James Burton, singer-songwriter Troy Shondell, songwriter Glenn Sutton, along with producers Shelby Singleton and Jim Vienneau. More importantly, the music still holds up, and thanks to Bear FamilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s digital remastering, sounds better than ever. One of rock and countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great underrated performers, Bob Luman enjoyed a special vocal gift that allowed him to alternately convey a sense of comfort as well as excitement. Eventually, Boudleaux Bryant penned LumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1960 Top 10 hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Think About Living.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Prior to that both Felice and Boudleaux - best known for their string of hits as sung by the Every Brothers - wrote some of the versatile solo artist's best material from that era including Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Got Everything,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Private EyeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big River RoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a well thought out duet with the adorable Sue Thompson Ã¢â‚¬Å“Too Hot To Dance.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Luman also recorded songs by such top writers as John D. Loudermilk (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Great Snowman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Don Gibson (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad Bad DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Doug Kershaw (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Louisiana ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Bobby Bare (Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬Ëœm Gonna Write A Song About YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Roy Orbison (Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Lonely Room,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Get So SentimentalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Mickey Newbury (Ã¢â‚¬Å“If You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Love MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Carl Perkins (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Poor Boy BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Troy Shondell (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Still Loving YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Despite this abundance of great songwriting, few of LumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early tunes were commercially successful and wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find an audience until years later. Before his death in 1978, he recorded a string of Top 40 country hits for Epic and Polydor which can be found on the Bob Luman 1968-1977 (BCD 15898), which was released in 2000. Both boxed sets are worthwhile, but rockabilly fans will consider this one absolutely essential.\nBy Johnny (Victoria, B.C.
