He summons the following people for the holiday: his scheming but imprisoned wife, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine; his mistress, Princess Alais, whom he wishes to marry; his three sons (Richard, Geoffrey, and John), all of whom desire the throne; and the young but crafty King Philip of France (who is also Alais' brother). With the fate of Henry's empire at stake, everybody engages in their own brand of deception and treachery to stake their claim.\n\nVideo #0 : XviD at 1243 Kbps\nAspect : 672 x 288 (2.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AC3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48 KHz\n\n\nSpoken language(s):\nEnglish\nTexted language(s):\nEnglish, French, Spanish ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:830b762ad188bf3e8ed301f4d4bfedf9cf8ec61c","amp;dn":"The+Lion+in+Winter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"830b762ad188bf3e8ed301f4d4bfedf9cf8ec61c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,11,118,42,209,136,191,62,142,211,1,244,212,191,237,249,207,142,198,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
