But even the resources of the universe are starting to dwindle, so five hundred billion humans begin the long journey back home. The desire to repopulate Earth starts the so-called Coming Home War, until the universal government of the Gaia Coalition declares Earth a sacred, and thus inaccessible, place.\n\nIn this dying universe, the space pirate Captain Harlock travels with his immensely powerful flagship, the Arcadia, to fulfill a mysterious purpose. The young Yama, brother of the Fleet Commander Ezra, is chosen to infiltrate the Arcadia's crew and discover the objective of the pirate captain.\n\n\n[Media Specs]\n\n[Video Information]\nVideo Codec:AVC1 - FFmpeg Decoder(h264)\nInput type:AVC1(24 bits)\nInput size:1280 x 536(2.40:1)\nOutput type:YUY2(16 bits)\nOutput Size:1280 x 536(2.40:1)\nFrame Rate:23.98\nBitRate: Unknown\n\n[Audio Information]\nAudio Codec:AAC(0xaac0) - Default Decoder\nSample rate:48000 -&gt;48000 samples / sec\nBit rate:16 -&gt;32 bits / sample\nChannels:2 -&gt;2 channels\nBitrate: 192 kbps\n\nSUBTITLE: English\n\n\n\n[Screenshots]\n\n[img=spch]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/43/rfwq.jpg[/img]\n\n[img=spch]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/42/84kl.jpg[/img]\n\n[img=spch]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/716/6ic5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img=spch]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/138/9q60.jpg[/img]\n\n[img=spch]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/691/06mr.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa00e7c037db5b213cb1cb376eff212bd9a035a9","amp;dn":"Space.Pirate.Captain.Harlock.2013.720p.BRRip.h264.AAC+%5BEnglish+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa00e7c037db5b213cb1cb376eff212bd9a035a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,0,231,192,55,219,91,33,60,177,203,55,110,255,33,43,217,160,53,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
