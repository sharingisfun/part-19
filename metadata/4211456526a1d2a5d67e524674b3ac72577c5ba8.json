Just copy the single file to any drive / folder and use it.\n\nPacket Tracer is a Cisco router emulator that can be utilized in training and education, but also in research for simple computer network simulations. The tool is created by Cisco Systems and provided for free distribution to faculty, students, and alumni who are or have participated in the Cisco Academy program. The purpose of Packet Tracer is to offer students and teachers a tool to learn the principles of networking as well as develop Cisco Technology specific skills.\n\nThe current version of Packet Tracer supports an array of simulated Application layer protocols, as well as basic routing with RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP, to the extent required by the current CCNA curriculum. While Packet Tracer aims to provide a realistic simulation of functional networks, it should be noted that the application itself only utilizes a small number of features found within the actual hardware running a current Cisco IOS. Thus, Packet Tracer is unsuitable for modeling production networks. With the introduction of version 5.3, several new features were added, including BGP. BGP is not part of the CCNA curriculum. It is part of the CCNP curriculum.\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4211456526a1d2a5d67e524674b3ac72577c5ba8","amp;dn":"Cisco+Packet+Tracer+5.3+Portable.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4211456526a1d2a5d67e524674b3ac72577c5ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,17,69,101,38,161,210,165,214,126,82,70,116,179,172,114,87,124,91,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
