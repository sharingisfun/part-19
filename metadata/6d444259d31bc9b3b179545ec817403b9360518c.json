L'Attentat won the Prix des libraires in 2006, a prize chosen by about five thousand bookstores in France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada.\n\n\nIn an interview with the German radio station SWR1 in 2006, Khadra said Ã¢â‚¬Å“The West interprets the world as it likes. It develops certain theories that fit into its world outlook, but do not always represent the reality. Being a Muslim, I suggest a new perspective on Afghanistan, on religious fanaticism and what I would call religiopathy. My novel, The Swallows of Kabul, gives readers in the West a chance to understand the core of a problem that they usually only touch on the surface. Because fanaticism is a threat for all, I contribute to the understanding of its causes and backgrounds. Perhaps then it will be possible to find a way to bring it under control.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½[1]\nYasmina Khadra became director of the Algerian Cultural Center in Paris in November 2007.\nOn November 2, 2013 Khadra announced his candidacy for the presidency of Algeria","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d444259d31bc9b3b179545ec817403b9360518c","amp;dn":"Yasmina+Khadra+%28Algerian+Author%29+-+3+Novels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d444259d31bc9b3b179545ec817403b9360518c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,68,66,89,211,27,201,179,177,121,84,94,200,23,64,59,147,96,81,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
