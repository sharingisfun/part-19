It is a 2D game set in a 3D world, as the two-dimensional player-character receives a fez that reveals a third dimension and consequently tears the fabric of his universe. Fez's puzzles are built around the core mechanic of rotating between four 2D views of a 3D space, as four sides around a cube, where the environment realigns between views to create new paths.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nCPU: Dual Core 2.4GHz\nRAM: 3GB\nOS: Win XP 32bit\nDirectX: DX9\nHDD Space: 500MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba1bdd5119c77df22c116da9470e0e8e191d5fcc","amp;dn":"FEZ+1.10+-+RG.REBOOT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba1bdd5119c77df22c116da9470e0e8e191d5fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,27,221,81,25,199,125,242,44,17,109,169,71,14,14,142,25,29,95,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
