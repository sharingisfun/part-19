With         \n        snow falling outside and more friends dropping by -          \n        carol singers from Sesame Street and visitors from           \n        Fraggle Rock - something magical happens! The sparkle        \n        of the stage lights up the farmhouse as the Muppets          \n        share their gifts of music, a play and of course,            \n        Fozzie's stand-up comedy act.

Today the rights to the            \n        various Muppet characters are spread between Henson,         \n        Disney and Sesame Workshop, but that was not the case        \n        when Jim was still alive. It wasn't often characters         \n        would meet across universes, and this is indeed the          \n        only time that Muppets, Fraggles, Sesame Street              \n        inhabitants and even Muppet Babies are all present           \n        in the same special. Heck, even Jim makes an                 \n        appearance! The Muppet Babies are cleverly presented         \n        in a flashback home video viewing, so this is also           \n        a rare appearance of Muppet Babies outside animation         \n        - yet another treat!                                         \n                                                                     \n          Due to the above-mentioned character rights issues,        \n        as well as for several other reasons (music rights,          \n        broadcast edits etc) this special has suffered many          \n        cuts over the years. The most complete home video            \n        version is this long out of print R2 2003 DVD release,       \n        which has less incidental music, and lacks two brief         \n        scenes. To bring you the most complete experience            \n        possible, we have included these cut scenes as extras,       \n        grabbed from the original 1987 ABC airing, the only          \n        time they were ever shown. We've also thrown in a            \n        few of the original promos, some of them of questionable     \n        quality, but enjoyable nonetheless. There's even a           \n        short bumper featuring Kermit and Fozzie, also only          \n        ever seen during the original airing, taken from one         \n        of the commercial breaks with Kermit announcing that         \n        the special will return shortly.                             \n                                           Enjoy!                    \n                                                                     \n                                               \n                                             \n                                               \n                    \n                \n                         \n                               \n                                               \n                                                                     \n                              ~HO HO HO~                             \n                                                                    \n                                                              \n                 For the month of December we've decided to     \n                do something special.
