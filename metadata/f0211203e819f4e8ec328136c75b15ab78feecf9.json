Nearly every track feels like itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s swathed in fog, and on songs such as \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the Lowlands,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Broensted's vocals remain one with the mist surrounding \n\nthem. While her voice is lovely, her melodies stay in a safe, similar range \n\ninstead of scaling highs and lows -- an approach that extends to much of \n\nGolden Sea. Yet, just when it feels like the album has receded into the \n\nbackground for good, something intriguing pulls it back into focus: the hand \n\ndrums and Middle Eastern-tinged melisma on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNightsongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or the distant \n\nelectro-toms on the oddly cheery ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Burial.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Our Broken Garden reaps \n\neven richer rewards whenever the band ventures into more daring territory: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Fiery and LoudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t particularly fiery or loud, but its yearning mood \n\nand fairy-tale melody give it urgency and drama, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGarden GrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a \n\nsurprisingly sexy standout with a stomping, Goldfrapp-esque beat and visceral \n\nlyrics like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrip my heart out if you have toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthrow me naked on the \n\nfloor.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ All the elements of Our Broken Garden's sound are promising on \n\nGolden Sea, but Broensted and crew are still learning to move beyond subtle, \n\nhypnotic music and toward something more dynamic. \n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/our-broken-garden/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/our-broken-garden/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0211203e819f4e8ec328136c75b15ab78feecf9","amp;dn":"Our+Broken+Garden...Golden+Sea%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0211203e819f4e8ec328136c75b15ab78feecf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,33,18,3,232,25,244,232,236,50,129,54,199,91,21,171,120,254,236,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
