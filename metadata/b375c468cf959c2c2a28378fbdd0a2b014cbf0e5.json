I use it as a tool to wake up friends and family, THANKS MIKE!\n\nA snippet from the book:\n\n&quot;Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create deposits, and with the flick of a pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take it away from them, and all the fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for this world would be a happier and better world to live in. But if you wish to remain slaves of the Bankers and pay for the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create deposits.&quot; -- Sir Josiah Stamp, President of the Bank of England in the 1920s, the second richest man in Britain &quot;\n\n\nYou can also watch this and keep the book for reference (why I made it in the first place [the pdf that is, I could not believe there was not one already made!])\n\nInsertbefore this:\nwatch?v=SKnF1HEUwuo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b375c468cf959c2c2a28378fbdd0a2b014cbf0e5","amp;dn":"ALL+WARS+ARE+BANKERS%27+WARS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b375c468cf959c2c2a28378fbdd0a2b014cbf0e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,117,196,104,207,149,156,44,42,40,55,143,189,208,162,176,20,203,240,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
