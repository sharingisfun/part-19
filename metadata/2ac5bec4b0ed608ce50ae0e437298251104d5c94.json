A Century of Silent Service is hosted by President Jimmy Carter, himself a former submarine officer.\r\nChronicling the genesis of the US Silent Service from the first real submarine, the C.S.S. Hunley, and John Holland's early gasoline powered boats, the program features an abundance of archival footage and material. \r\nWhether fighting tough foes in wars hot and cold, or going against the stark perils of a developing technology, the U.S. Naval Submarine Force has generated a history unique in American arms. The turn of the millennium marked its first 100 years. This 2-hour special features interviews with a former submariner, President Jimmy Carter, many key Navy experts, along with Silent Service notables such as Capt. Ned Beach, Medal of Honor recipient RADM Eugene Fluckey, VADM James Calvert, ADM Bruce Demars (former director of the US Navy's nuclear power program), and others including enlisted men and wives. Hearing the story told by them conveys the depth of impressive achievements and duty bestowed upon a free country by a special group of sailors. \r\n\r\nSonalysts Inc. Production for the History Channel\r\n\r\n2)  Part II \r\nPart II introduces us to the nuclear attack submarine and its world shattering partner, the ballistic missile boat. With more emphasis on stealth and lethality than ever before, the U.S. Submarine Force took on the Soviet Union in an undeclared war of detection and avoidance. American subs were able to track and remain undetected for weeks. American submarines were a prime factor in the containment strategy that brought the U.S.S.R. to collapse.\r\nStrategic submarines made over 3,000 deterrent patrols during the Cold War while safely and reliably controlling the nuclear weapons under their responsibility. Today, the Submarine Force enters its second century of service conducting complex operations demanding a stealthy, mobile, high-endurance platform with great firepower.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ed/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/75/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d9/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dc/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/A-Century-of-Silent-Service-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2 184 kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 704x536\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 4:3\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\r\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 43mn 30s\r\nNumber Of Parts: 3\r\nPart Size: 740 MB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=A_Century_of_Silent_Service","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac5bec4b0ed608ce50ae0e437298251104d5c94","amp;dn":"HC+A+Century+of+Silent+Service+2of3+x264+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac5bec4b0ed608ce50ae0e437298251104d5c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,197,190,196,176,237,96,140,229,10,224,228,55,41,130,81,16,77,92,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
