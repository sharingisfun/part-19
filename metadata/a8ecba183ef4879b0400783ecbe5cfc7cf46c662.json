Their debut is produced by the venerable David Sitek, TV on the Radio sonic mastermind and one of New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s current great authorities on all things cool. Sitek seems to have the Midas touch in bestowing projects with indie cred, giving Telepathe an almost criminal advantage in courting the skinny jean-sporting crowd. Months before its release, I found a worn-out, burned copy of the album at a Los Angeles art gallery, scratched beyond repair presumably from repeat listening. The Brooklyn girl duoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s preference for analog synths, the most fashionably retro-futuristic element of music imaginable, as well as their meticulously half-grungy/half-chic appearance, would elicit dread from any critic put in the position to evaluate the next ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnext big thing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ However, Telepathe transcend any hype, any preconceptions about whether theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnext big thingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or just look and talk like them, with an incredible debut album that transports listeners into a deliriously vibrant and colorful world of its own.\n\nDance Mother is musical pixie dust illuminated by a warm neon glow. There is a great sense of magic and wonder in TelepatheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music, their chirping, fairy-like, multi-tracked vocals providing a feeling of childlike awe. The programming, originally mapped out on Logic and eventually translated to SitekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wide arsenal of analog machines, offsets the innocence of Busy Gangnes and Melissa LivaudaisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ harmonies with menace and malice, no less colorful than their voices. SitekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s production flourishes make every sonic nuance rich and spacious, giving the band a grandiose sound that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t compromise any of its more claustrophobic moments. Opening track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo FineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ pulses and grinds with synthetic disco basslines and airy keyboard leads, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn Your LineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features marching drums and an elastic vocal melody that are destined to put entire arenas into a trance. Telepathe have crafted a fine debut effort that, perhaps through the assistance of David Sitek, sounds like the work of much more accomplished artists. The only trouble now is surprising people all over again with their follow-up, proving once again that they possess just as much substance as style.\n\nPlease seed to at least 1:1\n\nComments welcome\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8ecba183ef4879b0400783ecbe5cfc7cf46c662","amp;dn":"Telepathe+-+Dance+Mother+2009+320CBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8ecba183ef4879b0400783ecbe5cfc7cf46c662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,236,186,24,62,244,135,155,4,0,120,62,203,229,207,199,207,70,198,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
