Rating: \t\n  4.6 / 5 (based on 40 ratings). What did you think of it?\nPlot:\tA remake of/sequel to the classic &quot;Executioners From Shaolin&quot;, this kung fu classic sees our hero (Gordon Liu) receiving a sound thrashing from Pai Mei (Lo Lieh) early on, and later mastering the graceful embroidery technique from Kara Hui (Ying Hung).\nOverview:\tA remake of/sequel to the classic &quot;Executioners From Shaolin&quot;, this is kung fu cinema at its most absurd and most fun. Lo Lieh plays the dastardly White Eyebrow monk Pai Mei, who--besides being able to achieve weightlessness, so he simply floats away from his attacker&amp;#039;s blows--can suck his testicles into his abdomen! Our hero, played by &quot;baldhead&quot; Gordon Liu, receives a sound thrashing from Pai Mei early on, but later masters the graceful embroidery technique from kung fu babe Hui Ying Hung. Needless to say, he finally gets his revenge when, after some spectacular fight scenes, he attacks Pai Mei&amp;#039;s &quot;vital spot&quot;. Ouch! Ninety minutes of pure bliss.\nCast: \tGordon Liu (Chia Hui)  ||  Lo Lieh  ||  Kara Hui Ying-Hung  ||  Johnny Wang (Lung Wei)  ||  Ging Chue  ||  Yeung Jing Jing  ||  Cheng Miu  ||  Hsiao Ho\n(Click any actor to search for more of their movies!)\nRunning Time:\t89 mins.
