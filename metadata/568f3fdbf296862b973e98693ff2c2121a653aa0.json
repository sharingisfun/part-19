Mrs P's A-Z\r\nAfter getting lost in London using a map that hadn't been updated since 1918, Phyllis Pearsall decided to map the whole of London herself. She claimed to have set out at 5.00am each day and worked 18 hours a day, walking all 23,000 of London's streets. Her map, the London A-Z, was completed in 1936 and has been one of the most successful maps of all time.\r\n\r\nNick tries to follow Mrs P's trail. Can he use his explorer's knowledge to find his way? Can he find the famous 'phantom' roads, or do they only exist in the imagination of the A to Z mapmakers? Nick has only Phyllis Pearsall's street-by-street maps as his guide.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3700Kbps)\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 29 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 808 MB\r\nSource: HDTV (upscaled)\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:568f3fdbf296862b973e98693ff2c2121a653aa0","amp;dn":"Map.Man.Series2.7of8.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"568f3fdbf296862b973e98693ff2c2121a653aa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,143,63,219,242,150,134,43,151,62,152,105,63,242,194,18,26,101,58,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
