Fashioning himself Eric Galt, this nondescript thief and con manÃ¢â‚¬â€whose real name was James Earl RayÃ¢â‚¬â€drifted through the South, into Mexico, and then Los Angeles, where he was galvanized by George WallaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s racist presidential campaign.\n\nOn February 1, 1968, two Memphis garbage men were crushed to death in their hydraulic truck, provoking the exclusively African American workforce to go on strike. Hoping to resuscitate his faltering crusade, King joined the sanitation workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cause, but their march down Beale Street, the historic avenue of the blues, turned violent. Humiliated, King fatefully vowed to return to Memphis in April.\n\nWith relentless storytelling drive, Sides follows Galt and King as they crisscross the country, one stalking the other, until the crushing moment at the Lorraine Motel when the drifter catches up with his prey. Against the backdrop of the resulting nationwide riots and the pathos of KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funeral, Sides gives us a riveting cross-cut narrative of the assassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flight and the sixty-five-day search that led investigators to Canada, Portugal, and EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â€a massive manhunt ironically led by HooverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FBI.\n\nMagnificent in scope, drawing on a wealth of previously unpublished material, this nonfiction thriller illuminates one of the darkest hours in American lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€an example of how history is so often a matter of the petty bringing down the great.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - April 27th 2010\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23196906eee34267e7565fedde58c00265ae433","amp;dn":"Hellhound+on+His+Trail+by+Hampton+Sides+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23196906eee34267e7565fedde58c00265ae433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,49,150,144,110,238,52,38,126,117,101,254,221,229,140,0,38,90,228,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
