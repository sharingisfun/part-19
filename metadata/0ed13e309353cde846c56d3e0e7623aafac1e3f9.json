The tracklist is the preserved in order as played from the source.  The sound quality is very good.  I would classify this as for the most diehard Rush fans only!\n\nTracklist:\n1. Test For Echo\n2. The Color Of Right\n3. Dog Years\n4. Virtuality\n5. Half The World\n6. Driven\n7. Totem\n8. Time And Motion\n9. Resist\n10. Limbo\n11.
