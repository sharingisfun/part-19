A variety of guided exercises are supplemented by short papers and commentaries on legal and ethical issues, challenging readers to develop their own analyses and recommendations. Chapters cover death, genetics, new reproductive technologies, research, long-term care, mental health, children and young people, allocation of scarce resources, and general issues about autonomy and patient choice. An appendix discusses the use of this book in teaching, along with a full bibliography, list of Kennedy Institute keywords, and suggestions for further reading.\n\nDecember 2010\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a752d7f8443ff87539cba7c60f85167b482262","amp;dn":"Cambridge+Medical+Ethics+Workbook+2nd+ed.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a752d7f8443ff87539cba7c60f85167b482262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,167,82,215,248,68,63,248,117,57,203,167,198,15,133,22,123,72,34,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
