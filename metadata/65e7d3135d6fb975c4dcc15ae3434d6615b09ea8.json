That's exactly what Janet Jackson did in becoming one of the biggest female pop and R&amp;B stars of the '80s and '90s. Since her breakthrough in 1986 with the album Control, Jackson's career as a hitmaker has been a model of consistency, rivaling Madonna and Whitney Houston in terms of pop chart success over the long haul. A big part of the reason was that Jackson kept her level of quality control very high; her singles were always expertly crafted, with indelible pop hooks and state-of-the-art production that kept up with contemporary trends in urban R&amp;B. Once established, her broad-based appeal never really dipped all that much; she was able to avoid significant career missteps, musical and otherwise, and successfully shifted her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult. With a string of multi-platinum albums under her belt, she showed no signs of slowing down in the new millennium. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n01.Runaway\n02.What Have You Done For Me Lately\n03.Nasty\n04.When I Think Of You\n05.Escapade\n06.Miss You Much\n07.Love Will Never Do (Without You)\n08.Alright\n09.Control\n10.The Pleasure Principle\n11.Black Cat\n12.Rhythm Nation\n13.That's The Way Love Goes\n14.Come Back To Me\n15.Let's Wait Awhile\n16.Twenty Foreplay\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65e7d3135d6fb975c4dcc15ae3434d6615b09ea8","amp;dn":"Janet+Jackson+-+Design+Of+A+Decade+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65e7d3135d6fb975c4dcc15ae3434d6615b09ea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,231,211,19,93,111,185,117,196,220,193,90,227,67,77,102,21,176,158,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
