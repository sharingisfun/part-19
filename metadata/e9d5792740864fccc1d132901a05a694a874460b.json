Many of us knew we shouldn't really be watching it -- in my case, I should have been in the university libraries -- but it was the sheer appeal of something that was nominally supposed to be for children.\n\nBut Tiswas was a live production in which almost anything could happen -- the complete opposite of a DVD compilation, unless you play it in 'Shuffle' mode.\n\nAlso the pace of this 'Greatest Hits' DVD is nothing like the Saturday morning experience, where the two or three hours included many fillers (such as pop videos, ads and Disney clips) to get your expectations raised for the next piece of studio mayhem.\n\nPracitically anyone who was anyone in the 1970s appeared in this show -- well, anyone with a sense of fun and a willingness to be in Birmingham at the weekend -- and in this DVD, you'll see Michale Palin, Dennis Waterman, Steve Davis, Benny from 'Crossroads', the real Trevor MacDoughnutt etc etc.\n\nThe picture quality varies, but who cares?
