Fast-paced and highly entertaining, Banana takes us from jungle to supermarket, from corporate boardrooms to kitchen tables around the world. We begin in the Garden of EdenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½examining scholarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ belief that EveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œappleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was actually a bananaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and travel to early-twentieth-century Central America, where aptly named ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbanana republicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ rose and fell over the crop, while the companies now known as Chiquita and Dole conquered the marketplace. Koeppel then chronicles the bananaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s path to the present, ultimatelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and most alarminglyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½taking us to banana plantations across the globe that are being destroyed by a fast-moving blight, with no cure in sightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and to the high-tech labs where new bananas are literally being built in test tubes, in a race to save the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most beloved fruit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4acbf2bd8625b894f58a0477e91ede07ed39f22","amp;dn":"Banana+The+Fate+of+the+Fruit+That+Changed+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4acbf2bd8625b894f58a0477e91ede07ed39f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,172,191,43,216,98,91,137,79,88,160,71,126,145,237,224,126,211,159,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
