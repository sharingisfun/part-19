Petty's core musicians (guitarist Mike Campbell, bassist Howie Epstein, and keyboardist Benmont Tench) have been together for so long that their onstage communication is almost telepathic; the emphasis is always on dynamics and interplay instead of bombast.\n\n\n# Actors: Tom Petty, Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench, Howie Epstein, Scott Thurston\n# Directors: Martyn Atkins\n# Producers: Darren Rydstrom, James Pluta\n# Format: Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, DVD, Live, NTSC\n# Language: English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n# Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only.
