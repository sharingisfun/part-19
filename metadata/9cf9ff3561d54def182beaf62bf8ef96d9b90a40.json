Godfrey, &quot;Lake and Sea Monsters&quot;\nChelsea House Publications | 2008-07-30 | ISBN: 079109393X | 127 pages | PDF | 2,1 MB\n\nDid you ever have an experience that turned your whole world upside down? Maybe you saw a ghost or a UFO. Perhaps you had an unusual, vivid dream that seemed real. Maybe you suddenly knew that a certain event was going to happen in the future. Or, perhaps you saw a creature or a being that did not fit the description of anything known in the natural world. At first you might have thought your imagination was playing tricks on you. Then, perhaps, you wondered about what you experienced and went looking for an explanation.\n\n\nEvery day and night people have experiences they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t explain. For many people these events are life changing. Their comfort zone of what they can accept as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is put to the test. It takes only one such experience for people to question the reality of the mysterious worlds that might exist beyond the one we live in. Perhaps you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t encountered the unknown, but you have an intense curiosity about it. Either way, by picking up this book, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve started an adventure to explore and learn more, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve come to the right place! The book you hold has been written by a leading expert in the paranormalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½someone who understands unusual experiences and who knows the answers to your questions.
