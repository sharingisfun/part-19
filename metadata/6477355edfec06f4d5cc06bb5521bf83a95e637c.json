Graves is about to find out when her past comes back to haunt her. But before she and Jack can resolve her past, they need to deal with his.\n\nSix years ago Jack was left for dead during a SWAT raid he commanded. He never speaks of what happened that day, but he doesn't have a choice after someone starts murdering his men. According to the FBI, Jack is either next on the list, or he's the one behind it all.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Author:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLiliana Hart is a USA Today and New York Times Bestselling Author in both the mystery and romance genres. After starting her first novel her freshman year of college, she immediately became addicted to writing and knew she'd found what she was meant to do with her life. She has no idea why she majored in music. Liliana is an avid reader and a believer in all things romance. Her books are filled with witty dialogue, steamy sex, and the all-important happily-ever-afters her romantic soul craves. Since self-publishing in June of 2011, she's sold more than a million ebooks all over the world. She lives in Texas with her husband and four children, and they occasionally let her meet her deadlines.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6477355edfec06f4d5cc06bb5521bf83a95e637c","amp;dn":"Dirty+Rotten+Scoundrel+By+Liliana+Hart++PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6477355edfec06f4d5cc06bb5521bf83a95e637c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,119,53,94,223,236,6,244,213,204,6,187,85,33,191,131,169,94,99,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
