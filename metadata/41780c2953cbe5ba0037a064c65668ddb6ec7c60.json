All phases required for translating a high-level language to machine language is covered, including lexing, parsing, intermediate-code generation, machine-code generation and register allocation.  Interpretation is covered briefly.\n\nAiming to be neutral with respect to implementation languages, algorithms are presented in pseudo-code rather than in any specific programming language, and suggestions for implementation in several different language flavors are in many cases given.  The techniques are illustrated with examples and exercises.\n\nThe author has taught Compiler Design at the University of Copenhagen for over a decade, and the book is based on material used in the undergraduate Compiler Design course there.\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41780c2953cbe5ba0037a064c65668ddb6ec7c60","amp;dn":"basics+of+compiler+design+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41780c2953cbe5ba0037a064c65668ddb6ec7c60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,120,12,41,83,203,229,186,0,55,160,100,198,86,104,221,182,236,124,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
