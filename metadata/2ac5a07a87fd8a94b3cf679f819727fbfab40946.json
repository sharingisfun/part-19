It won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best Book and was shortlisted for the 1994 Sunday Express Book of the Year.  It has been translated into over 11 languages and remains an international bestseller.\n\nThe novel RED DOG (2001) was inspired by a statue of a dog he saw during a visit to the Pilbara region of Western Australia and was made into a film of the same name in Australia in 2011.  BIRDS WITHOUT WINGS (2004) is set in Turkey, and portrays the people in a small village toward the end of the Ottoman Empire, the rise of Kemal AtatÃƒÂ¼rk, and the outbreak of the First World War.  A PARTISAN'S DAUGHTER (2008) tells of the relationship between a young Yugoslavian woman and a middle-aged British man in the 1970s, set in London.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* BIRDS WITHOUT WINGS (Knopf, 2004).\n\n* CORELLI'S MANDOLIN (Pantheon, 1994).  Published in the UK as CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN.\n\n* A PARTISAN'S DAUGHTER (Knopf, 2008).\n\n* RED DOG (Knopf, 2001).\n\n* SENÃƒâ€¢R VIVO AND THE COCA LORD [Latin American Trilogy 2] (Vintage, 1998).\n\n* THE TROUBLESOME OFFSPRING OF CARDINAL GUZMAN [Latin American Trilogy 3] (Vintage, 1998).\n\n* THE WAR OF DON EMMANUEL'S NETHER PARTS [Latin American Trilogy 1] (Vintage, 1991).\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
