We got the skin color to look as natural as possible reducing the red and yellow quite alot, increased the brightness also as in some scenes it was quite dark...added a sharpness filter and slight video denoise. Originally was going to use imagines audio, then imagine released a r5, tried to mix their audio was in sync some time and out in some other so we just got their audio from their ts and synced, anyway Enjoy it spent some time on it :)\n\ncredit PrisM &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9362940ce486544ba01fd12d833910192f0bb1","amp;dn":"The.Bounty.Hunter.R5.LINE.XviD-PrisM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9362940ce486544ba01fd12d833910192f0bb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,147,98,148,12,228,134,84,75,160,31,209,45,131,57,16,25,47,11,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
