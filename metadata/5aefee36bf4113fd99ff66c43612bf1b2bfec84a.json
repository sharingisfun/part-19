It has some of the best Ricky/Karl interplay ever, including Karl's musings on blind ghosts and outwitting a psychic by thinking about her dog.\n\nThere has been an incomplete version of this bunging about the intertubes for a while now, but that version edits out some brilliant bits and cuts off suddenly when Ricky is in the middle of discussing an ant wearing a hard hat. This is the full, unexpurgated version.
