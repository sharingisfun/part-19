Not only had he survived a haemorrhage that had nearly killed him, but he had also met and fallen in love with Alma Schindler, for whom the Fifth Symphony's ardent Adagietto is a love song. Before that, Haydn's Symphony No. 34 makes its first appearance at the Proms.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROMS INTERVAL: What's in a Name?\r\n\r\nNo-one attributed more importance to naming the baby than Laurence Sterne's Walter Shandy but his attempts to ensure his son's future success came to naught and all because he couldn't get his trousers on. As the 2016 list of top baby names is revealed to a waiting world, Sophie Coulombeau explores literary archives to uncover the true story of What's In a Name? Just the fears, hopes and frustrations, ambitions and proclivities of British society over the centuries.\r\n\r\nMedia info:-\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nFormat : MPEG Audio\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Constant\r\nOverall bit rate : 320 Kbps\r\nWriting library : LAME3.98r\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : MPEG Audio\r\nFormat version : Version 1\r\nFormat profile : Layer 3\r\nMode : Joint stereo\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nStream size : 55.3 MiB (100%)\r\nWriting library : LAME3.98r\r\nEncoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 3 -lowpass 20.5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65964ac270da2b7effdf1126b7f7acfc514161eb","amp;dn":"BBC+Proms+2016%2C+Prom+39+-+Haydn%2C+Charlotte+Bray+and+Mahler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65964ac270da2b7effdf1126b7f7acfc514161eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,150,74,194,112,218,43,126,255,223,17,38,183,247,172,252,81,65,97,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
