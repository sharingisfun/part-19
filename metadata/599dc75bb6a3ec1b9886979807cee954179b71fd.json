I have divided it up into 6 separate torrents because it was about 18 Gigs as one torrent. I have listed the titles here, but since I have already spent a lot of time on this, I have not provided a description. You can look each of them up to get more info if you wish.\n\nThis is torrent 4 of 6 containing:\n\nAtlas of World War II, PDF &amp; CBR imagebook\nBeyond Band of Brothers\nHugh Ambrose - The Pacific\nKilling Rommel (MP3)\nOperation Mincemeat\nPatton, Montgomery, Rommel\nStephen Ambrose - D-Day\n\n\nHope this is satisfactory--let me know if it's not.\nI will seed for as long as possible, but give me some help.
