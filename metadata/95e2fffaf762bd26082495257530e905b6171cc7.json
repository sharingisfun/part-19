Spartan and immaculate, it contained his saxophoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a piano, a copy of the Rosicrucian Creed, a mountain of sheet music, and a set of bar bells. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Joe Goldberg, Jazz Masters of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“50s\n\n\n\n\nIn 1960, when the ever-private Sonny Rollins permitted jazz journalist Joe Goldberg into his sanctum sanctorum, the tenor saxophonist was approaching his 30th birthday. More than ten years had passed since his recording debut, five since the release of his stunning, self-defining album Saxophone Colossus. \n\nHis was a powerful instrumental voice filled with endless energy, rhythmic excitement and a fluid outpouring of melodic ideas. He was widely esteemed and acknowledged as one of the giants of his generation.\n\nYet, to Rollins, something was deeply amiss. Dissatisfied with his playing, he placed himself in a creative exile: he stopped performing in public, did not answer his phone, and was discovered practicing alone on the walkway of the Williamsburg Bridge. After months of rumors, Rollins wrote to Down Beat magazine, choosing his words with care to explain his disappearance.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI am at present engaged in numerous pursuits, the most pressing of which are my writing and composing. These endeavors are demanding of the greater portion of my time, concentration and energies and, I feel, will best be seen to fruition by my maintaining a certain amount of seclusionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nRollinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ absence only amplified his renown. An adoring, curious public awaited his return, and the tenor titan, who could be acutely self-aware and was always self-effacing, knew it. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be surprised when you hear me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he warned while still off the scene. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m playing just about the way I did before, only I think much better.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nThe first fruit of his period of self-imposed seclusion was The Bridge, released in 1962. This LP follows on from there.\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n\n01 Fifty-Second Street Theme 15:54\n02 Django 5:28\n03 Now's the Time 16:00\n04 I Remember Clifford 6:33\n\n\nCD2\n\n\n01 St. Thomas 3:09\n02 Afternoon in Paris 3:06\n03 Four I 6:57\n04 Four II 8:57\n05 Winter Wonderland 5:24\n06 When You Wish Upon a Star 3:27\n07 Trav'Lin' Light 13:30\n\n\n\n\nThad Jones (cor) Sonny Rollins (ts) Bob Cranshaw (b) Roy McCurdy (d)\nNYC, January 20, 1964\n\nI Remember Clifford\n\nSonny Rollins (ts) Herbie Hancock (p -2,5/7) Ron Carter (b) Roy McCurdy (d)\nNYC, February 14, 1964\n\n1. 52nd Street Theme\n2.
