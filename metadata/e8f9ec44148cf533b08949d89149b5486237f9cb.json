Bubba Sparxxx's &quot;Ms. New Booty&quot; and Lil Wayne's &quot;Fireman&quot; weren't that old, either, and E-40's &quot;Tell Me When to Go&quot; had just made the rounds, although Bay Area residents might be ticked that the totally hyphy track ended up on a crunk collection. Regardless, it would be a shame to say you care about Southern club music and don't have Three 6 Mafia's &quot;Stay Fly,&quot; Mike Jones' &quot;Back Then,&quot; and the remix of Daddy Yankee's &quot;Gasolina&quot; in your collection. The filler is better than usual and the flow is smooth so ignore the boring cover art and get mostly crunk plus a little hyphy with this satisfying comp. \n\nTrack Listing \n\n1. LIL JON feat.
