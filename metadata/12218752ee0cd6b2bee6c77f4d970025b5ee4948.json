While Metallica and Megadeth were watering down their approach for a more mainstream sound, Pantera got harder with VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER.\n\nFrom the moment vocalist Phil Anselmo screams his first &quot;Revenge!&quot; in &quot;Mouth for War,&quot; the stage is set. Drummer Vinnie Paul showcases relentless technical prowess thrashing out complex double-bass drum patterns in &quot;A New Level&quot; and &quot;By Demons be Driven,&quot; while guitarist Diamond Darrell&amp;#039;s seemingly endless supply of hard-grooving, blues-inspired hooks are the heart of &quot;No Good&quot; and &quot;Live in a Hole.&quot; In the emotional power-ballad &quot;Hollow,&quot; the song&amp;#039;s protagonist faces the heartache of having a friend trapped in a coma; and just as in the epic &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; from COWBOYS FROM HELL, Anselmo continues to struggle with the consequences of fate and the will of the world.\n \nTrack Listing \n1.
