These are some of Lewis' very best recordings; the tonal palette is richly varied as he pays homage to his influences and contemporaries in the pantheon of classic blues and boogie-woogie piano. \n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Medium Boogie (Yancey Special) \n02 - Fast Boogie \n03 - Slow Boogie (Dupree Blues) \n04 - Honky Tonk Train Blues \n05 - Jumpin' With Pete \n06 - Riff Boogie \n07 - Cow Cow Blues \n08 - Yancey Special \n09 - Honky Tonk Train Blues \n10 - Albert's Blues \n11 - Pinetop's Boogie Woogie \n12 - Mr. Freddie's Blues \n13 - Suitcase Blues \n14 - Spooney Sam \n15 - Mama's Bounce \n16 - Shooboody \n17 - Hangover Boogie \n18 - Yancey's Last Ride \n19 - Bush Street Boogie\n\nPersonnel:\n\nMeade &quot;Lux&quot; Lewis - Piano, Soloist\nLouie Bellson - Drums\nIsrael Crosby - Bass\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:031a33389b9ce993ca768c6ef46d5b0b7b4a98ba","amp;dn":"Meade+Lux+Lewis+1946-1954+%28The+Chronological+Classics%29%28jazz%29%28mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"031a33389b9ce993ca768c6ef46d5b0b7b4a98ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,26,51,56,155,156,233,147,202,118,140,110,244,109,91,11,123,74,152,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
