Real-world examples are included, together with global spectrum regulations and policies, for a practical approach to developing technologies for worldwide applications. Cross analog and digital design guidelines are provided to help cut design time and cost. This holistic, system level view of transceiver design for white space technologies is ideal for practising engineers and students and researchers in academia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:064cc27b44ac6e17b04fd92bedde0d732aeca267","amp;dn":"White+Space+Communication+Technologies%5BMyeBookShelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"064cc27b44ac6e17b04fd92bedde0d732aeca267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,76,194,123,68,172,110,23,176,79,217,43,237,222,13,115,42,236,162,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
