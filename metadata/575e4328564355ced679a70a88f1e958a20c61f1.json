DeMille.\n\n\nThe effect of the parting of the Red Sea was created by placing two blocks of blue gelatin side-by-side, heating them until they melted...then running the footage in reverse.\n\n\nThe Egyptian set seen in the prologue was, in reality, an enormous construction, and was actually considerably larger than the Babylon sets in D.W. Griffith's Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages (1916), to which they are often compared.\n\n\nMost of the chariot crashes in the prologue were real and unplanned.\n\n\nDuring one day of the filming of the Exodus scenes, about sixty bit players were injured in chariot crashes. Most went right back to work after getting bandaged up.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:575e4328564355ced679a70a88f1e958a20c61f1","amp;dn":"The+Ten+Commandments+%281923%29+-+Cecil+B+DeMille","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"575e4328564355ced679a70a88f1e958a20c61f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,94,67,40,86,67,85,206,214,121,167,10,136,241,233,88,162,12,97,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
