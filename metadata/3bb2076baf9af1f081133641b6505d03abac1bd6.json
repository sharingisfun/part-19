HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of the few blues guitarists who learned his craft first-hand from the masters of the blues such as Muddy Waters, rather than from recordings.  On Extra Jimmies, Blind Pig Records has compiled a sterling collection of gems from perhaps his most creative period (1992 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1998).\n \nBlind Pig is proud to have helped Jimmy launch his solo career.  After a fifteen year stint as co-founder and lead guitarist of the legendary blues-rock band The Nighthawks, he formed the popular R&amp;B band The Assassins.  Five years later he put together his three piece band called The Drivers to highlight his explosive guitar.   Jimmy and his band became renowned road warriors, playing close to 300 dates a year and establishing him as one of the premier guitarists around.\n \nThe re-mastered tracks on Extra Jimmies are taken from ThackeryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blind Pig debut album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Empty Arms Motel,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as from two other out-of-print CD titles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wild Night Out!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a live recording) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Switching Gears.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bb2076baf9af1f081133641b6505d03abac1bd6","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Thackery+-+Extra+Jimmies+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bb2076baf9af1f081133641b6505d03abac1bd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,178,7,107,175,154,241,240,129,19,54,65,182,80,93,3,171,172,27,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
