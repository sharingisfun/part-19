The Goon and his sidekick Franky often get tied up in other machinations, often in relation to the evil zombie gangs under the command of the Nameless Zombie Priest. The series has a distinctly paranormal slant, with the average story concerning ghosts, ghouls, skunk-apes with an unnatural hunger for pie, extra-dimensional aliens, and mad scientists. \t\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0f31580a78bff2e74f40a5f9d62c4e136b50e22","amp;dn":"The+Goon+%28Dark+Horse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0f31580a78bff2e74f40a5f9d62c4e136b50e22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,243,21,128,167,139,255,46,116,244,10,95,157,98,196,225,54,181,14,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
