Enkele momenten voordat NASA's eerste bemande ruimtevlucht, Capricorn 1 naar Mars zal plaatsvinden, worden de drie astronauten naar een verlaten basis gebracht, waar hun baas Kolloway hen meedeelt dat hun ruimtepakken niet bruikbaar zijn voor een ruimtevlucht. Om te vermijden dat de president na deze kapitale blunder de financiÃƒÂ«le middelen voor het ruimteprogramma van NASA zou inkrimpen, wordt de Capricorn 1 zonder bemanning gelanceerd. De lancering van het ruimtetuig gaat voor de televisiekijkende wereld toch door, en de astronauten worden gedwongen mee te werken aan een gesimuleerde landing. Wanneer het ruimteschip, na zijn zogenaamde terugkeer van Mars, ontploft, begrijpen de astronauten dat zij nooit meer naar huis zullen kunnen terugkeren.\nAt an unspecified time, Capricorn OneÃ¢â‚¬â€the first manned mission to MarsÃ¢â‚¬â€is on the launch pad. Such NASA authorities as Dr. James Kelloway (Hal Holbrook) realize, too late, that a faulty life-support system supplied by a corrupt NASA contractor will kill the astronauts during the flight. As the manned space program needs a success to continue, they find themselves forced to falsify the landing rather than cancel the mission.\n\nMinutes before launch, the bewildered crew of Air Force Colonel Charles Brubaker (James Brolin), Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Peter Willis (Sam Waterston), and Navy Commander John Walker (O. J. Simpson) are removed from Capricorn One and flown to an abandoned United States Army Air Corps desert base. The launch proceeds on schedule, but the public is unaware that the spacecraft is empty. At the base, the astronauts are informed they will help counterfeit the television footage during the flight to and from Mars, and that it is their patriotic duty to participate for the sake of national morale and prestige. Initially they refuse, but Kelloway, himself under extreme duress (from whom, what, or where is never clearly specified) to go through with the hoax, threatens their families if they do not cooperate, claiming a bomb will explode on a plane carrying the family members.\n\nThe astronauts remain in captivity during the flight and are filmed landing on Mars within a studio located at the base. The conspiracy is known to only a few officials, until alert technician Elliot Whitter (Robert Walden) notices that ground control receives the crew's television transmissions before the spacecraft telemetry arrives. Whitter mysteriously disappears before he can finish sharing his concerns with journalist friend Robert Caulfield (Elliott Gould). Caulfield discovers that all evidence of his friend's life has been erased and begins investigating the mission, surviving several attacks on himself and his reputation.\n\nUpon returning to Earth, the empty spacecraft unexpectedly burns up due to a faulty heat shield during re-entry. The captive astronauts board a plane to be placed in the spacecraft but the plane unexpectedly turns around and returns to the airfield. They realize that something has gone badly wrong with the re-entry process and that officials can never release them because doing so would automatically expose the hoax. Knowing that the only logical solution for their captors is to kill them during the cover-up process, they break out of their confinement and escape in a Learjet, which runs out of fuel soon ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e6e1451f28475ca7d521a6d6ca0489236a2f822","amp;dn":"Capricorne.One.1977.Dvd5.NLsub%2BENGsub.Optional","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e6e1451f28475ca7d521a6d6ca0489236a2f822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,110,20,81,242,132,117,202,125,82,26,109,108,160,72,146,54,162,248,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
