Later that night, Mildred is murdered and Steele is a prime suspect; his record of belligerence when angry and his macabre sense of humor tell against him. Fortunately, lovely neighbor Laurel Gray gives him an alibi. Laurel proves to be just what Steele needed, and their friendship ripens into love. Will suspicion, doubt, and Steele&amp;#039;s inner demons come between them? \n\n7.9 out of 10 stars IMDB rating.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a166dba01518efa807cfbed64e38152990d93f72","amp;dn":"In+a+Lonely+Place+-+Humphry+Bogart+1950+-+AC3+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a166dba01518efa807cfbed64e38152990d93f72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,102,219,160,21,24,239,168,7,207,190,214,78,56,21,41,144,217,63,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
