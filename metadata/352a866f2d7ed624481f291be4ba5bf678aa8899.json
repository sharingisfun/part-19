Robinson), a mild banker and amateur painter is at a dinner honoring him for twenty-five years of service in the bank for which he works. On his way home, he helps Kitty (Joan Bennett), an amoral femme fatale who is apparently being attacked by a man. Soon, he becomes enamored of her because his own domestic life is ruled by his bullying wife Adele (Rosalind Ivan), who idolizes her former husband, a policeman drowned while trying to save a woman.\nFrom Christopher's comments about art, Kitty mistakenly believes him a wealthy painter. It turns out that the attacker was Johnny, Kitty's brutish boyfriend (the film implies as strongly as possible under the Production Code that he's her pimp. The postage meter advertising slogan used by Universal Studios to promote the film pictures a woman leaning against a lamp post with a man nearby, a classic image of a prostitute, with whom she was arguing over money. Johnny convinces Kitty to pursue the relationship with Cross, in order to extort money from him. Kitty inveigles Cross to rent an apartment for her, one that can also be his art studio. They take an expensive apartment.\nTo finance this secret life, Cross steals from the bank. Meanwhile, Johnny tries selling some of Cross's paintings, attracting the interest of a famous art critic. Kitty is forced by Johnny to pretend she painted them, charming the critic, who promises to represent her. When Cross's wife sees her husband's paintings in a commercial art gallery as the work of Katherine March, she accuses him of copying March's work. Cross is glad his paintings are appreciated, albeit under Kitty's signature, and happily lets her become the public face of his art.\nMeanwhile, the supposedly dead first husband of Cross's wife suddenly reappears. He explains he had not drowned, but had stolen money from the woman he supposedly was saving. Already suspected as corrupt, he had taken the opportunity to hide. With that, Cross understands his marriage will be invalidated when he confronts his wife with her live dead first husband. Having arranged that, he believes he can then marry Kitty, only to catch her in Johnny's arms. Shocked, he confronts Kitty, but still asks her to marry him; she taunts him in reply. Furious, he murders Kitty with an ice-pick. Johnny is accused, convicted, and put to death for Kitty's murder, despite his attempts to implicate Cross, who goes unpunished. At the trial, Cross denies he painted any of the pictures, however Cross's embezzlement is discovered and he is fired from his job. Posthumously, Kitty is recognized as a great artist.\nAt story's end, Cross, haunted by thoughts of Kitty, attempts to hang himself. He is rescued, but becomes a poor man with no way of claiming credit for his own paintings. He is haunted by Kitty and Johnny being together for eternity, loving each other.\n\n\nTRAMA E GIUDIZIO CRITICO\n\ndal Morandini - Dizionario dei film\n\nSposato a una megera, anziano cassiere e pittore dilettante s'innamora di una prostituta che spinta dal suo protettore gli vende i quadri come se fossero suoi. La uccide, ma ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ condannato l'altro. Rifacimento di La chienne (1931) di Jean Renoir che era tratto da una piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ce di George de la FouchardiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, ma Lang, aiutato da un'ottima sceneggiatura di Dudley Nichols, ne ha cavato qualcosa di originale: una storia psicologica con un magico sottofondo da incubo.\n\n\nREPORT Avinaptic\n\n[ Info sul file ]\nNome La strada scarlatta - Xvid Ita Eng Mp3.avi\nDimensione 889,288,704 bytes (848.092 MB)\n\n[ Info generiche ]\nDurata 01:37:30 (5850.24 s)\nTipo di contenitore AVI OpenDML\nStreams totali 3\nTipo stream n. 0 video\nTipo stream n. 1 audio\nTipo stream n. 2 audio\nAudio streams 2\nISFT VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nJUNK VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\n[ Dati rilevanti ]\nRisoluzione 624 x 468\nLarghezza multipla di 16\nAltezza multipla di 4\n\n[ Traccia video ]\nFourCC xvid/XVID\nRisoluzione 624 x 468\nFrame aspect ratio 4:3 = 1.333333\nPixel aspect ratio 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio 4:3 = 1.333333\nVprp aspect ratio 5:4 = 1.25\nFramerate 25 fps\nFrames totali 146256\nStream size 691,489,984 bytes\nBitrate 945.588535 kbps\nQf 0.129518\nKey frames 803 (0; 300; 600; 900; 1200; ... 146156)\nNull frames 0\nMin key int 5\nMax key int 300\nKey int medio 182.136986\nRitardo 0 ms\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 1 ]\nAudio tag 0x55 (MP3)\nBitrate (contenitore) 128 kbps CBR\nCanali (contenitore) 2\nFrequenza (contenitore) 48000 Hz\nChunks 146246\nStream size 93,604,608 bytes\nPreload 480 ms\nMax A/V diff 496 ms\nTipo MPEG-1 Layer III\nChunk-aligned No\nEmphasis none\nMode joint stereo\nRitardo 0 ms\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 2 ]\nAudio tag 0x55 (MP3)\nBitrate (contenitore) 128 kbps CBR\nCanali (contenitore) 2\nFrequenza (contenitore) 48000 Hz\nChunks 146244\nStream size 93,602,963 bytes\nPreload 480 ms\nMax A/V diff 496 ms\nTipo MPEG-1 Layer III\nChunk-aligned No\nEmphasis none\nMode joint stereo\nRitardo 0 ms\n\n[ Info sulla codifica MPEG4 ]\nUser data DivX503b1393p\nUser data XviD0050\nPacked bitstream SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬ (*)\nQPel No\nGMC No\nInterlaced No\nAspect ratio Square pixels\nQuant type H.263\n\n[ Profile compliancy ]\nProfilo da testare MTK PAL 6000\nRisoluzione Ok\nFramerate Ok\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352a866f2d7ed624481f291be4ba5bf678aa8899","amp;dn":"La+strada+scarlatta+-+Scarlet+Street+%28Fritz+Lang%29+%5BXviD+Ita+Eng+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352a866f2d7ed624481f291be4ba5bf678aa8899","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,42,134,111,45,126,214,36,72,31,41,27,228,186,91,246,120,170,136,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
