They took\nup a long residency at San Francisco's Blackhawk nightclub and gained great\npopularity touring college campuses, releasing a series of albums with such titles\nas Jazz at Oberlin, Jazz Goes to College, and Jazz Goes to Junior College.\n\nBy 1958, after a handful of different drummers and bassists, the &quot;Classic\nQuartet&quot; so called because it remained as such virtually consistently until the\ngroup dissolved ~ had been assembled, consisting of Brubeck, Desmond, Joe\nMorello on drums, and Eugene Wright on bass. In 1959, the Dave Brubeck Quartet\nreleased Time Out, an album their label was enthusiastic about but nonetheless\nhesitant to release. The album contained all original compositions, almost none of\nwhich were in common time. Nonetheless, on the strength of these unusual time\nsignatures [the album included &quot;Take Five&quot;, &quot;Blue Rondo ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  la Turk&quot;, and &quot;Pick Up\nSticks&quot;], it quickly went platinum. The quartet followed up its success with several\nmore albums in the same vein, including Time Further Out [1961], Countdown:\nTime in Outer Space, Time Changes, and Time In. These albums were also known\nfor using contemporary paintings as cover art, featuring the work of S. Neil Fujita\non Time Out, Joan MirÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³ on Time Further Out, Franz Kline on Time in Outer Space,\nand Sam Francis on Time Changes [no artist's work, however, was featured on the\ncover of Time In]. A high point for the group was their classic 1963 live album At\nCarnegie Hall, described by critic Richard Palmer as &quot;arguably Dave Brubeck's\ngreatest concert&quot;.\n\nThe &quot;classic&quot; Dave Brubeck Quartet broke up in 1967, except for a 25th\nanniversary reunion in 1976. Brubeck formed a new quartet in 1968. Today, the\nDave Brubeck Quartet continues to tour the world, performing hits from the classic\nQuartet era as well as new material..\n\n\nSteve Race introduces the legendary Dave Brubeck Quartet in a restored and reedited\n1964 programme, featuring Paul Desmond on saxophone, Gene Wright on\nbass, Joe Morello on drums and Brubeck on piano. Songs include Take 5, the first\njazz record to sell over one million copies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21261673517292942045.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21261673517292942045.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 296 MiB\nDuration                         : 27mn 42s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1494 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7d35141a153d314e534d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1330 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.128\nWriting library                  : x264 core 79\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 188 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nLanguage                         : English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brubeck&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brubeck&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c864dad866c105d947c432de489ddbbac0a12f","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Jazz+625+-+1964+Dave+Brubeck+Quartet+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2c864dad866c105d947c432de489ddbbac0a12f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,200,100,218,216,102,193,5,217,71,196,50,222,72,157,219,186,192,161,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
