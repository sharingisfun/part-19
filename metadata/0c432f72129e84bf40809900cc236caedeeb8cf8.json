They are one of the most successful and critically acclaimed bands of the twentieth century. Rolling Stone has described them as &quot;innovative, precise yet sensual, calculated yet galvanizing&quot; and has also declared that the band &quot;changed the sound of black pop&quot;.\n\nWith That's the Way of the World having made Earth, Wind &amp; Fire one of the best-selling soul bands of the 1970s, Maurice White and co. had no problem filling large arenas. As dynamic as EWF was on-stage, it's a shame that there isn't more documentation of the band's live show. Only one live EWF album was released by a major label in America, the superb Gratitude. First a two-LP set and later reissued on CD, Gratitude brilliantly captures the excitement EWF generated on-stage at its creative peak. Neither hardcore EWF devotees nor more casual listeners should deprive themselves of the joys of the live versions of &quot;Shining Star&quot; and &quot;Yearnin' Learnin'.&quot; Maurice White is magnificent throughout, and Philip Bailey truly soars on extended versions of &quot;Reasons&quot; (which boasts a memorable alto sax solo by guest Don Myrick) and &quot;Devotion.&quot; The album also introduced some excellent new studio songs, including the haunting &quot;Can't Hide Love&quot; and the uplifting &quot;Sing a Song.&quot; One could nitpick and wish for live versions of &quot;Evil,&quot; &quot;Keep Your Head to the Sky,&quot; and &quot;Kalimba Song,&quot; but the bottom line is that Gratitude is one of EWF's finest accomplishments.\n\nStereo 2.0 DFF tracks extracted with Scarletbook\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfrom the 2002 SACD.\n\nSACD-ISO-DFF-1Bit-2.8Mhz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c432f72129e84bf40809900cc236caedeeb8cf8","amp;dn":"Earth%2C+Wind+%26amp%3B+Fire+-+Gratitude+%281975%29+2002+SACD-DFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c432f72129e84bf40809900cc236caedeeb8cf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,67,47,114,18,158,132,191,64,128,153,0,204,35,108,174,222,235,140,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
