But who, or what, is/are, Abraham . . . really? Abraham is a name. A symbol. A feeling. Abraham is a Non-Physical entity Ã¢â‚¬â€ whom Esther calls &quot;infinite intelligence&quot; and Jerry stated, &quot;the purest form of love I've ever encountered.&quot;\n\nLouise Hay calls them &quot;some of the best teachers on the planet today.&quot; She is the Hay House founder and best-selling author of inspirational, self-help books including Heal Your Body, You Can Heal Your Life ...\n\nTo Dr. Wayne Dyer they are &quot;the great Masters of the Universe!&quot; He is an internationally best-selling author of more than 30 books including The Power of Intention, Change Your ThoughtsÃ¢â‚¬â€Change Your Life...\n\n... everything you need to know about Life and how to make it work... All the tools with which to create the experiences youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always wanted. -- Neale Donald Walsch, author, Conversations with God, on The Teachings of Abraham.\n\nMy wife and I have enjoyed these profound and extremely practical Abraham teachings for several years. -- John Gray, PhD. author, Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus\n\nThe Abraham-Hicks teachings have inspired me to a grand new level of clarity, confidence, purpose, and passion. -- Alan Cohen, author, A Deep Breath of Life\n\n... practical teachings of Abraham will have you trusting your inner guidance again, and will set you on course for the most uplifting adventures imaginable. -- Jack Canfield, co-author of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series\n\n\nThe Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience. \n\nAbraham, a group of obviously evolved teachers, speak their broader Non-physical perspective through the physical apparatus of Esther. Speaking to our level of comprehension, from their present moment to our now, through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant yet comprehensively simple, recordings in print and in sound -- they guide us to a clear connection with our Inner Being -- they guide us to self-upliftment from our total self. \n\nCheck out Abraham for yourself. It's the only way to go and the only way to know. \n\nAnd finallyÃ¢â‚¬â€from JerryÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;Mr. Practical&quot;: &quot;I don't know what they are and I don't care what they are. I'm just using them for the good it will do for myself and others.&quot;...\n\nThank you to all who participated to make this possible!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce1710c849d3d89258695eae43e2dbe2cdbb4090","amp;dn":"Abraham-Hicks+2013-06-08+Boston+MA+3CDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce1710c849d3d89258695eae43e2dbe2cdbb4090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,23,16,200,73,211,216,146,88,105,94,174,67,226,219,226,205,187,64,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
