Socrates roved the Athenian agora, courting trouble with the authorities. Rousseau immortalized his rambles through nature on the printed page. Nietzsche once said that only ideas conceived while walking have any value.\n\nIn Examined Life, filmmaker Astra Taylor accompanies some of today's most influential thinkers on a series of unique excursions through places and spaces that hold particular resonance for them and their ideas.\n\nPeter Singer's thoughts on the ethics of consumption are amplified against the backdrop of Fifth Avenue's posh boutiques. Michael Hardt ponders the nature of revolution while surrounded by symbols of wealth and leisure. Judith Butler and a friend stroll through San Francisco's Mission District questioning our culture's fixation on individualism.\n\nAnd while driving through Manhattan, Cornel West - perhaps America's best-known public intellectual - compares philosophy to jazz and blues, reminding us how intense and invigorating a life of the mind can be.\n\nOffering privileged moments with great thinkers from fields ranging from moral philosophy to cultural theory, Examined Life reveals philosophy's power to transform the way we see the world around us and imagine our place in it.\n\nFeaturing Cornel West, Avital Ronell, Peter Singer, Kwarne Anthony Appiah, Martha Nussbaum, Michael Hardt, Slavoj Zizek, Judith Butler and Sunaura Taylor.\n\nTrailer:\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/3282/exa2avi003840962.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/3282/exa2avi003840962.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9673/exa2avi005088917.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9673/exa2avi005088917.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/8316/exa2avi001597762.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/8316/exa2avi001597762.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRip Specs:\n\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD \nDuration : 1h 28mn \nBit rate : 1 482 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 384 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.875 (~ 1.85) \nFrame rate : 23.976 fps \nResolution : 24 bits \nColorimetry : 4:2:0 \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.224 \nStream size : 934 MiB (92%) \n\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nDuration : 1h 28mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nResolution : 16 bits \nStream size : 80.7 MiB (8%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95fbc3d49ce4e14a76a0f812c600f4c6e5de36ce","amp;dn":"Examined+Life+%282008%29+DVDRip+-+modern+philosophy+%2F+social+science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95fbc3d49ce4e14a76a0f812c600f4c6e5de36ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,251,195,212,156,228,225,74,118,160,248,18,198,0,244,198,229,222,54,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
