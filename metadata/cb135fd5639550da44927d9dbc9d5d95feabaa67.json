Their style is not \n&quot;...constrained by the psychobilly tag but veer[s] into punk, country and metal influences too.\n&quot; Mad Sin, formed in 1987, have been inspired by horror punk and B-movie, with a theatrical style.\n Without abandoning the psycho-horror lyrical content, their musical arrangements have widened to\n incorporate other variables.[2] That attitude blasts through Mad Sin's sped-up combination of\n rockabilly, punk, white-trash blues and tongue-in-cheek sarcasm.[3]\nHistory\n\n1980s\n\nFounded 1987 by Koefte De Ville, who had just dropped out of school, punk and rockabilly\n guitarist Stein and four-week-bass-playing Holly, they struggled around with the help of \nsome friends, who organized gigs in several shady bars of Berlin. They played as street musicians\n in shopping malls, where they played rockabilly, country, and blues songs to get the tourist's\n money.[4]\n\n2010\n\nOn April 23, 2010, Mad Sin released their eleventh album Burn and Rise on People Like You records.\n\nSide Projects\n\nKÃƒÂ¶fte formed a side project called Dead Kings with members of Batmobile, Nekromantix,\n Klingonz &amp; Milwaukee Wildmen. Holly, his brother, and Tex followed their Rockabilly \nroots and Dusty Gray and His Rough Riding Ramblers. Stein joined the United Swindlers with members\n of Frantic Flintstones and Ripmen. Peter Sandorff is a member of the psychobilly band Hola Ghost.\n Valle, Tex Morton and Andy Laaf are the &quot;Berlin Three&quot; of U.S. Bombs and One Man Army Drummer\n Chip Hanna in his Country/Americana project Chip Hanna &amp; The Berlin Three which Chip started in 2006","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb135fd5639550da44927d9dbc9d5d95feabaa67","amp;dn":"Mad+Sin+14+CD%27s+ape%2Bcue+incl.+art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb135fd5639550da44927d9dbc9d5d95feabaa67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,19,95,213,99,149,80,218,68,146,125,157,188,157,93,149,254,171,170,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
