They slither, swim, walk and crawl, leap and lunge, and some spend their entire lives contained within a shell. Their ranks include some of the most skillful predators on Earth. And their long-departed dinosaur ancestors are an unending source of fascination to humanity, both in fiction and scientific endeavor. They are &amp;#039;The Reptiles,&amp;#039; the fascinating subjects of a four-part NATURE miniseries.&quot;\n\nPart 4 - Lizards\n\n&quot;The Reptiles&quot; series concludes with the most extraordinarily diverse of all reptiles. Lizards can be found on mountain tops, in the oceans, and in deserts and forests. Viewers meet some of nature&amp;#039;s most spectacular and beautiful varieties, ranging from giants more than ten feet long to tiny creatures no larger than a child&amp;#039;s finger. Lizards bite, lose their tails, have tongues longer than their entire body, and some can even walk on water. The show travels across the globe to feature some of the most fascinating varieties of lizards, including Indonesia, for a look at the deadly Komodo dragon. The program also looks at people who form strong attachments to the animals, such as Henry Lizardlover, who changed his name to express his feelings for the reptiles. Henry sells photographs of his many lizards posed in a variety of humorous settings. \n\nmore info: http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/reptiles/\n\n==\nRuntime: 53mins\nSource: OTA High Definition 1080i\nEncoding: xvid.928x528.1698kbps.mp3.160.vbr\nFile Size: 700MB\n\nFederal funding for CPB/PBS is going to be cut significantly over the next two years, so if you watch any of these programs, please support your local PBS Station by making a contribution or by purchasing their DVDs.
