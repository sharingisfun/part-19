Whether in cinema doorways, school playgrounds or pubs, the consensus seemed to be that it laid out TolkienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tale in a suitably epic fashion and was no less a feat than the Lord of the Rings trilogy. And yet, and yetÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ because weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d seen it all before Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the silhouetted convoy traipsing over pan-shot New Zealand landscapes, the wizards, orcs and elves - because weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d seen it all before the experience was unexpectedly anticlimactic. Thus it is with Black Rebel Motorcycle ClubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seventh album. It does what it does impeccably but they have covered this ground with panache already.\nIt is, then, an enjoyable album, one their fans will relish, although it could do with sounding scuzzier, dirtier. Often likened to the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, this is BRMC approaching the &quot;Sidewalking&quot;-era Chain, rough yet polished. The blues-rock snarl of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hate the TasteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (great lyric Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I hate the taste but I do it all againÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), for instance, has a sleazy groove, but it's Motorhead by way of prime Billy Idol plasticity. Some of the best songs are the heroin-y, sub-Spacemen 3/Spiritualized fare, the soft, drowsy, lo-fi hypno-blues of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some Kind of GhostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the smeared Gregorian gospel slouch of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes the LightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. They also do, and have always done, a mean line in head-nodding drone-rock, best exemplified here by the pulsing, distorted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sell ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The near-nine minute closing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lose YourselfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is also worthy of mention, a slow-blooming narco-ballad that Primal Scream would be proud of.\nBlack Rebel Motorcycle Club wear rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll clichÃƒÂ© with pride, the leather, the black, the drug references and wearily strived-for enigma, and the lesser songs here are easy to mock as a result. However, while they tread familiar ground, they do so with memorable riffs, and quite enough sonic oomph to retain the attention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e067035907ea608ee4dd8dfa2651ccfef1782af6","amp;dn":"Black+Rebel+Motorcycle+Club+-+Specter+At+The+Feast+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e067035907ea608ee4dd8dfa2651ccfef1782af6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,103,3,89,7,234,96,142,228,221,141,250,38,81,204,254,241,120,42,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
