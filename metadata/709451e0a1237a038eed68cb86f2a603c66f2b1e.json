Although comprehensive in its coverage, this textbook focuses on calculating molecular structures and (relative) energies and less on molecular properties or dynamical aspects. No prior knowledge of concepts specific to computational chemistry are assumed, but the reader will need some understanding of introductory quantum mechanics, linear algebra, and vector, differential and integral calculus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:709451e0a1237a038eed68cb86f2a603c66f2b1e","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Computational+Chemistry+2nd+ed+-+Frank+Jensen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"709451e0a1237a038eed68cb86f2a603c66f2b1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,148,81,224,161,35,122,3,142,237,104,203,134,242,166,3,198,111,43,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
