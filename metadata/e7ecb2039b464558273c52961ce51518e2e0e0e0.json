His father was an Alabama slave who acquired the surname Lipscomb when he was sold to a Texas family of that name. Lipscomb dropped his given name, Bowdie Glenn, and named himself Mance when a friend, an old man called Emancipation, passed away. Lipscomb and Elnora, his wife of sixty-three years, had one son, Mance Jr., three adopted children, and twenty-four grandchildren. \n\nLipscomb represented one of the last remnants of the nineteenth-century songster tradition, which predated the development of the blues. Though songsters might incorporate blues into their repertoires, as did Lipscomb, they performed a wide variety of material in diverse styles, much of it common to both black and white traditions in the South, including ballads, rags, dance pieces (breakdowns, waltzes, one and two steps, slow drags, reels, ballin' the jack, the buzzard lope, hop scop, buck and wing, heel and toe polka), and popular, sacred, and secular songs. Lipscomb himself insisted that he was a songster, not a guitarist or &quot;blues singer,&quot; since he played &quot;all kinds of music.&quot; His eclectic repertoire has been reported to have contained 350 pieces spanning two centuries. (He likewise took exception when he was labeled a &quot;sharecropper&quot; instead of a &quot;farmer.&quot;) \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ecb2039b464558273c52961ce51518e2e0e0e0","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Mance+Lipscomb+-+Trouble+In+Mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ecb2039b464558273c52961ce51518e2e0e0e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,236,178,3,155,70,69,88,39,60,82,150,28,229,21,24,226,224,224,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
