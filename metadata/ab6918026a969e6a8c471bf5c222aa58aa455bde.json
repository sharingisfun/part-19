Energy and power engineers and technologists have made our lives much more comfortable and affordable. However, due to the demands of the global population on resources and the environment, innovations of more reliable and sustainable energy resources/management with reduced impact on the environment are being increasingly demanded. The Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC) is an annual International Conference that has been held ever since 2009, and the last seven APPEECs attracted many scientists, engineers and technologists from all around the world to attend, providing ideal forums for them to exchange their new ideas and findings. The 8th APPEEC (APPEEC 2016), which is sponsored by Wuhan University and the 1000 Think Tank, was held from April 15 to 17, 2016 in Suzhou, China. â€œAdvances in Power and Energy Engineering: Proceedings of APPEEC 2016â€ provides cutting-edge scientific and engineering papers of energy and power presented by leading experts in their specialties, and is indeed an excellent reference for energy managers, researchers, engineers/technologists and policy makers to keep up with the latest developments in the fields of Power and Energy Engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6918026a969e6a8c471bf5c222aa58aa455bde","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Power+and+Energy+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6918026a969e6a8c471bf5c222aa58aa455bde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,105,24,2,106,150,158,106,140,71,27,245,194,34,170,88,170,69,91,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
