The chilling impact of Darwin's Theory of Evolution. Darwin's Deadly Legacy looks at the grim social impact of Charles Darwin's idea that all life is the product of time and chance. That theory - never proven and now increasingly discredited - laid the foundation for genocide in Nazi Germany, Adolt Hitler, a disciple of Darwin, tried to speed up evolution by subjecting some 12 million men, women, and children to a horrible death in the Holocaust.

James Kennedy.\n\nDivX     1 Hour 10 Mins    640 x 480     29 Fps     1400 Kbps\n\nDarwin's Dilemma \n\nExamines what many consider to be the most powerful refutation of Darwinian evolution - the Cambrian fossil record. Charles Darwin realized that the fossil evidence did not support his theory of gradual, step-by-step evolutionary development. He hoped that future generations of scientists would make the discoveries necessary to validate his ideas. Today, after more than 150 years of exploration fossil evidence of slow, incremental biological change has yet to be excavated. Instead, we find a picture of the rapid appearance of fully developed, complex organisms during the outset of the Cambrian geological era. Organisms that embody the major animal body plans that exist today. This remarkable explosion of life is truly Darwin's Dilemma and is best explained by the existence of a transcendent intelligence.\n\nDivX     1 Hour 14 Mins    720 x 360     29 Fps     1000 Kbps     \n\nKent Hovind  \n\n100 Reasons why evilution is so Stupid.\n\nDivX     1 Hour 50 Mins    352 x 240     29 Fps     700 Kbps      \n \n\nCreation Is A Fact","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adb8cc5ebebd6cb67ceb936701743cb3f3bf5a47","amp;dn":"Darwin+%28Pack%29+%28DivX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adb8cc5ebebd6cb67ceb936701743cb3f3bf5a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,184,204,94,190,189,108,182,124,235,147,103,1,116,60,179,243,191,90,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
