Like a slightly off-kilter George Plimpton, Cass, in his daring exploits, reveals the intricacies of fear, attention, stress, reward, and consciousness from the inside out. Along the way, he weaves in the story of his stepfather's manic depression and drug addiction, in addition to his own problems--which are many. Cass attacks the subject of the human brain with wit and candor, turning popular science into something distinctly human. Head Case is an imperative read for anyone who has ever wondered, &quot;Why am I who I am?&quot;\n\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2873d2cc492086334df36aaeeeb29a1aa4a6131","amp;dn":"Head+Case%3A+How+I+Almost+Lost+My+Mind+Trying+to+Understand+My+Bra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2873d2cc492086334df36aaeeeb29a1aa4a6131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,135,61,44,196,146,8,99,52,223,54,170,238,235,41,161,170,74,97,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
