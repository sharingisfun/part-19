Something In The Way\n\n\nSome songs are just so good that they stick in your head like napalm and just won't stop burning. Smells Like Teen Spirit is one of those tunes. From the opening stuttering chord progression to the thundering intrusion of the drums, it hit the ears of 1991 like &quot;what the hell is this?!?&quot; Shades of metal, shades of punk and a pure pop melody at the heart of it. Also the greatest thing about Nevermind is that there is no filler on this record. Every song is a good song and there's no need to skip anything. I can't really express in words just how great this record is, you just have to experience it. It's not metal, it's not punk, it's not pop - but yet it's all of these and then more. A genuine masterpiece.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 45\nArtist: Nirvana\nAlbum: Nevermind\nYear: 1991\nGenre: Grunge/Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9328e42cb2e7d8d0e81024cb37593617982d61b","amp;dn":"Nirvana+-+Nevermind+%5BFLAC-1991%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9328e42cb2e7d8d0e81024cb37593617982d61b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,50,142,66,203,46,125,141,14,129,2,76,179,117,147,97,121,130,214,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
