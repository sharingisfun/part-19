Turning the standard concept of a hip-hop crew inside out, the Wu-Tang Clan were assembled as a loose congregation of nine MCs, almost as a support group. Instead of releasing one album after another, the Clan were designed to overtake the record industry in as profitable a fashion as possible -- the idea was to establish the Wu-Tang as a force with their debut album and then spin off into as many side projects as possible. In the process, the members would all become individual stars as well as receive individual royalty checks. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tLoud Music\nCatalog:\t\t88697 38186\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.94% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing Ta F' Wit\n02.Method Man\n03.Protect Ya Neck\n04.C.R.E.A.M.\n05.Shame On A Nigga\n06.Da Mystery Of Chessboxin'\n07.Incarcerated Scarfaces\n08.Shimmy Shimmy Ya\n09.Daytona 500\n10.Winter Warz\n11.Reunited\n12.Triumph\n13.It's Yourz\n14.Older Gods\n15.Run\n16.Gravel Pit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             ***Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05f6a5019d5876d0292b792c4d82428a4764caf4","amp;dn":"Wu+Tang+Clan+-+Wu%3AThe+Story+Of+The+Wu-Tang+Clan+2008+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05f6a5019d5876d0292b792c4d82428a4764caf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,246,165,1,157,88,118,208,41,43,121,44,77,130,66,138,71,100,202,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
