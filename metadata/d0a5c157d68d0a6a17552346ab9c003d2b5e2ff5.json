There's plenty to see and do in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and even Staten Island - the outer boroughs, as they're known. But Manhattan is the New York of most people's dreams.\nFrom the lush green of Central Park to the neon lights of Times Square and the laid-back life of the West Village to the hustle and bustle of Harlem, something in this city is sure to fascinate you.\nThe city is big, brash and sprawling, yet when you get right down to it, it's just a series of interlocking neighbourhoods, each exciting and vibrant in its own way, and each with a singular pace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0a5c157d68d0a6a17552346ab9c003d2b5e2ff5","amp;dn":"The+Real+New+York+USA+-+BBC+Travel%2FTourist+Documentary+H264.AAC.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0a5c157d68d0a6a17552346ab9c003d2b5e2ff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,165,193,87,214,141,10,106,23,85,35,70,171,156,0,61,43,94,47,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
