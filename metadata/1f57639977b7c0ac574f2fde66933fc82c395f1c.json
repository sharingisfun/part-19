PUBLICATIONS | 2007 | ISBN 81-8213-029-8 | PDF | 352 pages | 13.6 mb\nscanned to PDF by me.\n\nThis book &quot;The Detective Stories&quot; is an acclaimed sub-genre of crime fiction, important for its high entertainment value, the contributions of its best writers, and its influences on other aspects of popular culture (films, radio and television drama). The private detectives' antecedents may be traced all the way back to Sherlock Holmes. The 17 stories in this book represent some of the finest short detective fiction of the past half century, by most of the writers who have helped define and are in the process of redefining detective literature.\n\nContents\nMAX ALLAN COLLINS The Strawberry Teardrop (Nate Heller)\nEDWARD GORMAN The Reason Why (Jack Dwyer)\nSTUART M.
