And now that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an adult, she also realizes that some things she knows about, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather not seeÃ¢â‚¬â€like Eric Northman feeding off another woman. A younger one.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a thing or two sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to say about that, but she has to keep quietÃ¢â‚¬â€Felipe de Castro, the Vampire King of Louisiana (and Arkansas and Nevada), is in town. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the worst possible time for a human body to show up in EricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s front yardÃ¢â‚¬â€especially the body of the woman whose blood he just drank.\n\nNow, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Sookie and Bill, the official Area Five investigator, to solve the murder. Sookie thinks that, at least this time, the dead girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate has nothing to do with her. But she is wrong. She has an enemy, one far more devious than she would ever suspect, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set out to make SookieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world come crashing down","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d6b352628997f8e0ffb6e6751c747e88ecb6562","amp;dn":"Deadlocked+%28Sookie+Stackhouse+book+12%29+-+Charlaine+Harris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d6b352628997f8e0ffb6e6751c747e88ecb6562","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,107,53,38,40,153,127,142,15,251,110,103,81,199,71,232,142,203,101,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
