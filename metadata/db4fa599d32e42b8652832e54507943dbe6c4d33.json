Gordon Wasson. After sparking the psychedelic era of the 1960s, however, the divine mushroom returned underground from whence it mysteriously originated. Yet today, the mushroomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extraordinary influence is once again being felt by large numbers of people, due to the discovery of hundreds of wild psilocybin species growing across the globe. \n\nIn The Psilocybin Solution, Simon G. Powell traces the history of the sacred psilocybin mushroom and discusses the shamanic visionary effects it can induce. Detailing how psilocybin acts as a profound enhancer of consciousness and reviewing the research performed by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), Johns Hopkins University, and the Heffter Research Institute on psilocybinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to dispel anxiety in the terminally ill and its helpful effects on obsessive-compulsive disorder, he examines the neurochemistry, psychology, and spirituality underlying the visionary psilocybin experience, revealing the interface where physical brain and conscious mind meet. Showing that the existence of life and the functioning of mind are the result of a naturally intelligent, self-organizing Universe, he explains how sacred mushrooms provide a direct link to the wisdom of Nature and the meaning of life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db4fa599d32e42b8652832e54507943dbe6c4d33","amp;dn":"The+Psilocybin+Solution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db4fa599d32e42b8652832e54507943dbe6c4d33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,79,165,153,211,46,66,184,101,40,50,229,69,7,148,61,190,108,77,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
