How can it manage to be so outrageously creative? How Creativity Happens In The Brain is a concise affair with a sharp focus: to stick exclusively to sound, mechanistic explanations and convey what we can, and cannot, say about how brains give rise to creative ideas. The book examines previous theories which have dominated neuroscience before presenting alternative suggestions as to how the field can develop. These include variation-selection algorithms, the newly emerging prediction system, the brain's dual information-processing platform (explicit vs. implicit) as well as basic concepts from cognitive psychology, such as connectionist networks, task set, task-set inertia, and speed of processing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dfad9d089081bb699b26774c9a832f94cdd928d","amp;dn":"How+Creativity+Happens+in+the+Brain+-+Arne+Dietrich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dfad9d089081bb699b26774c9a832f94cdd928d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,250,217,208,137,8,27,182,153,178,103,116,201,168,50,249,76,221,146,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
