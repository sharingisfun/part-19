Thoroughly Canadian, it incorporates case studies drawn from the authors' experience, as well as perspectives, legislation, and procedures that are particular to Canada. A variety of enrichment materials are included throughout the book, as is expanded coverage on working with other members of the health care team and the importance of written reports and accurate documentation.\n \nThe third Canadian edition features updated CPR standards, review questions, and visuals. As well, the authors have worked significantly on expanding the section on diseases of concern, the glossary, pertinent medications, and corresponding NOCPs (National Occupational Competency Profiles of the Paramedic Association of Canada). Their dedication to creating a current and thorough textbook is clearly reflected in the fact that it has been a student favourite for more than a decade.\n\n\nEnjoy !!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd886438dc8859e65a258db795713888c2287af1","amp;dn":"Emergency+Medical+Responder.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd886438dc8859e65a258db795713888c2287af1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,136,100,56,220,136,89,230,90,37,141,183,149,113,56,136,194,40,122,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
