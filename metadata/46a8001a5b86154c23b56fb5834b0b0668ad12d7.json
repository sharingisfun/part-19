While other programs limit you to two players with a Cross-Fader, Virtual DJ Studio provides you with an entire studio.\n\nThe two-deck metaphor is out-dated. There is no reason to limit yourself when your PC can easily give you so much more.\n\nNow, with Virtual DJ Studio, you can break free from this tired metaphor!\n\nYou will quickly see how VDJ is different from other DJ software. Laid out like a Mixer, each Line features a full MP3, WAV and Playlist player, with its own Volume Fader, Pitch/Tempo control, and more.\nRequirements:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 500 MHz Processor\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46a8001a5b86154c23b56fb5834b0b0668ad12d7","amp;dn":"Virtual+DJ+Studio+5.41+%2B+Serials.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46a8001a5b86154c23b56fb5834b0b0668ad12d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,168,0,26,91,134,21,76,35,181,111,181,131,75,11,6,104,173,18,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
