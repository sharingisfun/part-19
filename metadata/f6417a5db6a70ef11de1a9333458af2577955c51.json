Lightweight and beautiful. All-new apps. A refined look.\n\nCommunity Driven.\n\nelementary has a single goal: to provide the best possible experience for our community. We're driven by a desire to be better, not by a paycheck. Contributors aren't profit-maximizers, they're purpose-maximizers.\n\n\nTransparent and Open.\n\nWe believe in the power of open source and global collaboration. That means anyone can download, use, modify, and contribute to the code we've written to bring their ideas to life. The code is developed in the open, meaning it's available for review, scrutiny, and improvement by tens of thousands of developers all around the world. All before it hits your system.\n\n\nBeautiful and Usable.\n\nelementary is crafted by designers and developers who believe that computers can be easy, fun, and gorgeous. By putting design first, we ensure we're not compromising on quality or usability.\n\n\nModern Computing.\n\nelementary OS is a free replacement for Windows on the PC and OS X on the Mac. It comes with what you'd expect, like a fast web browser and an app store with thousands of apps. Plus some things you may not expect, like free updates and no known viruses.\n\nSpeedy\n\nLuna has been engineered from the ground up to be light on its toes. It starts up quickly, logs in instantly, and uses the bare minimum of resources so that your apps enjoy a speed boost as well. And with Luna, you get the same Linux foundation chosen for the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fastest supercomputers.\n\nFull of Features\n\nWhen you install elementary, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not just installing an operating system. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re installing an excellent suite of custom tailored apps that let you get right to business. Easily surf the web, check your email, listen to music, and tackle everyday tasks or pleasures.\n\n\nFully Accessible\n\nDifferent kinds of people from all over the world build elementary, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no surprise that Luna is built with this in mind. It comes stocked with apps and tweaks for the hearing and sight impaired, and well as assistance for the motor impaired.\n\n\nSafe and Secure\n\nLuna is built on the rock-solid foundation of Linux (the same software that powers the US Department of Defense, the Bank of China, and more). It has no known viruses, which means no pesky anti-virus software to slow down your system. Luna receives security updates as soon as a problem is discovered, meaning thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no waiting around for the most secure system.\n\n\n100% Free\n\nelementary OS is completely free, both in terms of pricing and licensing.

You can install Luna on as many computers as you want or even copy it and give it away to your friends.\n\n\nReady for Apps\n\nelementary OS comes with a built-in app store, stocked with thousands of free apps. Quickly find what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for without worrying about malware from the web.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6417a5db6a70ef11de1a9333458af2577955c51","amp;dn":"%28Linux%29++Elementary+OS+%26quot%3BLuna%26quot%3B+64+Bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6417a5db6a70ef11de1a9333458af2577955c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,65,122,93,182,167,14,241,29,225,169,51,52,88,175,37,119,149,92,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
