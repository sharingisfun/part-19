Blues Summit songs Contains liner notes by Andy McKaie. BLUES SUMMIT, a series of duets with a who's who of the blues, is classic B.B. King, probably his finest album of the 1990s. And if BLUES SUMMIT proves anything, it's that B.B. King is still hard, still a leader, still capable of raising the hairs on the back of your neck as he grooves into his sixth decade of preaching the blues.B.B. King isn't merely a blues innovator, he's a student of the music, an avid collector of blues, R&amp;B and jazz recordings. Blues Summit CD music contains a single disc with 12 songs.  Kinda felt the need for the Blues. If you seed this at least you know where to find it Enjoy \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06e1ca6fa68de199f4f19d3621860b954b39812d","amp;dn":"B.B.+King-King+Of+The+Blues+Disk+2+mp3++256k++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06e1ca6fa68de199f4f19d3621860b954b39812d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,225,202,111,166,141,225,153,244,241,157,54,33,134,11,149,75,57,129,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
