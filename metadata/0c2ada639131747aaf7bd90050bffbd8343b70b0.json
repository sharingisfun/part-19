Grabsky also offsets Stevenson's traditional chronicle of Beethoven's life with letters from the composer, read by David Dawson, that unveil an intense and almost belligerent side to the musical giant, leavened with offbeat humour.\n\n\nIncludes English hard-encoded subtitles in the German dialogue sections.\n\n\nRunning Time: Approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!
