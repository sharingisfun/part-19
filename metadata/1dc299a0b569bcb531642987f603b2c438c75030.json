Swedish Schnapps is as good a place as any to make that connection with Parker's music, including as it does two of his most enduring bop heads based on the blues, &quot;Au Privave&quot; and &quot;Blues For Alice.&quot; While you wouldn't mistake either composition for a Muddy Waters tune, both relate Bird's off-kilter accents and serpentine melodicism at walking tempos that let you hear what's actually going by, instead of leaving you astonished but bemused. To really drive the point home, there's &quot;K.C. Blues,&quot; which finds the altoist at his hollerin' best, and &quot;Lover Man,&quot; certainly one of the bluesiest 32-bar standards around.\n\nTracklist\n1. Si Si (2:40)\n2.
