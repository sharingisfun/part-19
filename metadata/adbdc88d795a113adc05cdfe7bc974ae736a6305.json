After a review of digital-color concepts, the course explores creating color profiles for each device in the digital photography workflow, from monitor to printer, to camera. Joe demonstrates the tools and techniques behind color profiling, even covering tabletsâ€”ideal for photographers using iPads or Android tablets as wireless remote controls.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tWhat gear can and should be profiled?\r\n\tâ€¢\tComparing color spaces\r\n\tâ€¢\tChoosing a monitor\r\n\tâ€¢\tProfiling your monitor\r\n\tâ€¢\tPaper-profiling devices\r\n\tâ€¢\tProfiling iOS and Android devices\r\n\tâ€¢\tSoft proofing\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adbdc88d795a113adc05cdfe7bc974ae736a6305","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Advanced+Color+Workflows+for+Photographers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adbdc88d795a113adc05cdfe7bc974ae736a6305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,189,200,141,121,90,17,58,220,5,205,254,123,201,116,174,115,106,99,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
