Now,\ntwo years on from their classic first album start,\nRazorlight have made their definitive statement.\nThey had a #2 single with &amp;#039;Somewhere Else&amp;#039; and blew\naway their peers with their trademark riotous\nperformance at Live 8.\n\n&quot;There are many things to cherish about this\nrecord... its length, sound, simplicity, sheer brass\nballs and its songs... And if making the best guitar\nalbum since &amp;#039;Definitely Maybe&amp;#039; is what&amp;#039;s required,\nthen job done. 5/5&quot; - Q Magazine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3e7ab865447af10d223f4534d791bdaf5198f97","amp;dn":"Razorlight-Razorlight-2006-uF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3e7ab865447af10d223f4534d791bdaf5198f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,231,171,134,84,71,175,16,210,35,244,83,77,121,27,218,245,25,143,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
