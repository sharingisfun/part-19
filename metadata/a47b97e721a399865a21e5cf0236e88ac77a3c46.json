The smallest of them looked like tiny luminous umbrellas, the largest of them looked like transparent overstuffed pillows with long tentacles dangling underneath.  Regardless, ALL jellies look like stars when they are first born, and they all move very VERY slowly in the water.  \n\nIf you use your imagination, you can feel how slowly the jellies swim through the water- simply by listening to and feeling the slow pulse of the music.  \n\nThe music is written in 4 movements (sections)- each one describing a different mood or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcolor.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Each movement depicts a different aspect of the mystery and beauty of the ocean, and the jellies who live there.  \n\nHere are the names of the different movements:\n\nJellies Singing Hello, Welcoming You to Their World\nJellies Being Born\nJellies- Royalty of the Sea\nJellies- Swimming in Light\n\n \nI've also included a very special track Cochiti (named after the Sacred Cochiti Pueblo in New Mexico), featuring Medicine Drums and string orchestra.\n\nA note regarding Cochiti:\n\nA few years ago I took a solo camping trip to New Mexico.  While I was there, I met a beautiful Tewa (thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the name of a Native American Tribe) family who live on the Cochiti Pueblo.  They are truly some of the kindest people IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever met.  The Grandfather of the family is a Medicine Drum maker.  Native Drums are very Sacred.  They literally sing the heartbeat of the very earth we live on.\n\nAfter returning home from my camping trip, I received a special Medicine Drum in the mail that the Grandfather had made for me.  A week after it arrived, I had an AMAZING dream filled with music and dance.  In it, I heard LOTS of Drums playing with an orchestra while elders of all walks of life danced together in a Circle.  Really, really cool.  I wrote the music down when I woke up the following morning.  Soon after that, the Boston Symphony played it!  Now, you can hear the dream too!\n\nThe music begins with a brass chorale (trumpets, trombones, tubas and french horns all playing together). Keep listening! The Drums come in after the first minute. \n\nLots of kids love to draw pictures and make up stories while listening to Cochiti.  Have fun!  \n\n \n&quot;Ruth, your music is extraordinary&quot;  - Dr. Jane Goodall\n\n\n&quot;Whatever you can do, or dream you can, do it.\nBoldness has genius, power, and magic in it.&quot; - Goethe\n - - -\n\nAmazing Jellies - Written, Arranged and Produced by Ruth Mendelson\nPatty Barkas, vocals (pattybarkas.com)\nMarsia Shuron Harris, vocals (mshmusic.com)\nCaroline Wilkins, vocals\nRuth Mendelson, everything else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a47b97e721a399865a21e5cf0236e88ac77a3c46","amp;dn":"AMAZING+JELLIES+-+Ruth+Mendelson+%28trance%2Frelaxation%29+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a47b97e721a399865a21e5cf0236e88ac77a3c46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,123,151,231,33,163,153,134,90,33,229,207,2,54,232,138,199,122,60,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
