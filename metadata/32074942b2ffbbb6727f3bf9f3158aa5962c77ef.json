They were in great form during the ten tunes featured on this live date. Sometimes, as on &quot;Custard Pie&quot; or &quot;Barking Bull Dog,&quot; they're funny; at other times, they were prophetic, chilling, or moving. This is Piedmont blues at its best, and this disc's tremendous remastering provides a strong sonic framework.\n\n\nTrack List:\n1. Evil Hearted Me\n2. Sick Man\n3. Barking Bull Dog\n4. Spread the News Around\n5. Backwater Blues\n6. Custard Pie\n7. Wholesale Dealin' Papa\n8. Motorcycle Blues\n9. Hand in Hand\n10. I Woke Up One Morning and I Could Hardly See\n\n\nLineup:\nSonny Terry - Harmonica, vocals (#2,3,4,6,8)\nBrownie McGhee - Guitar, vocals (#1,5,7,9,10)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32074942b2ffbbb6727f3bf9f3158aa5962c77ef","amp;dn":"Brownie+McGhee+%26amp%3B+Sonny+Terry+-+%5B1962%5D+At+the+2nd+Fret+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32074942b2ffbbb6727f3bf9f3158aa5962c77ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,7,73,66,178,255,187,182,114,127,59,249,243,21,138,165,150,44,119,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
