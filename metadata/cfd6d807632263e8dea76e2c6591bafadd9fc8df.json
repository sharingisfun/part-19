The &quot;ReCovered&quot; in the title refers to two slight (and somewhat subjective) improvements in presentation: Firstly, while the new cover artwork for the digital edition is gorgeous, it's not very well suited to its purpose; these volumes are bookended with the full-colour covers used in the print editions (or equivalent) instead. Secondly, about a dozen double-page spreads, each split into two regular pages in the original releases, were re-joined, thereby greatly enhancing their visual effectiveness, IMO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfd6d807632263e8dea76e2c6591bafadd9fc8df","amp;dn":"The+Collected%2BReCovered+Sin+City+%28DH%7CDgtl-1280%7CEmpire%29+%26reg%3B1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfd6d807632263e8dea76e2c6591bafadd9fc8df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,214,216,7,99,34,99,232,222,167,110,44,101,145,186,250,221,159,200,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
