She meets Mike, who falls in love with her and they become lovers. But Mike has no idea about Bridget&amp;#039;s past and her plans to use him to get rid of her husband... Written by Chris Makrozahopoulos \n\nAs a European writer of crime fiction I often lament the contrived &amp;#039;happy endings&amp;#039; of most American movies, so I was pleased with The Last Seduction, and its main character Bridget Gregory, a bitch who not only goes unpunished for her cruel and heartless behaviour, but is actually rewarded for her skill in manipulating the hapless men around her. Fiorentino&amp;#039;s sardonic portrayal of Bridget is fantastic, you can see the gears of manipulation turning behind every calculating look she casts around. And instead of making her evil, this just makes her intelligent and ruthless, something a lot of women would like to be. A highly enjoyable movie.
