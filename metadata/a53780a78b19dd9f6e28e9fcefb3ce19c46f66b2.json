Before long though, female voices join in with the males to continue the album's flow of gradually climbing to a more powerful crescendo ... A solo female vocalist comes in next for a brief moment in the spotlight, and then a subtle beat begins to chime in, only to explode with an infectious Enigma-like dance beat. (Now if that doesn't draw you in, I don't know what will). . . \n\nThe initial sound of Era is something that's very akin to Pilgrimage and Lesiem: Gregorian-type choral singing with the occassional electric guitar and english male/female rock vocal, which is the factor that evidently draws in comparisons to Enigma. \n\nI admit, Era does seem to be a bit over-hyped with boundless 5-star reviews, but as I sit here listening to this CD, pondering all of its possible faults, I come up empty-handed. Songs like &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Enae Volare Mezzo&quot; make this a very enjoyable album, and I highly recommend it to fans of classical-crossover, new age, and maybe even world music. \n\nby Clarissa &quot;MoonGoddess&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Era.wma                                           \n02 - Ameno (Remix).wma                                 \n03 - Cathar Rhythm.wma                                 \n04 - Mother.wma                                        \n05 - Avemano.wma                                       \n06 - Enae Volare Mezzo.wma                             \n07 - Mirror.wma                                        \n08 - Ameno.wma                                         \n09 - Sempire D'amor.wma                                \n10 - After Time.wma                                    \n11 - Impera.wma\n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53780a78b19dd9f6e28e9fcefb3ce19c46f66b2","amp;dn":"Era+-+Era+%281996%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a53780a78b19dd9f6e28e9fcefb3ce19c46f66b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,55,128,167,139,25,221,159,110,40,233,252,239,179,206,25,196,111,102,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
