In 45 minutes Herzog manages to reveal more about the feelings of the competitor and a sport than most documentaries twice its length do. Herzog\\'s cameras capture both the grace and gruesomeness of the jump as Steiner meets with failure and success. Steiner is quite candid in assessing himself, revealing insecurities and doubts.\n\nHerzog\\'s cameras much of the time seem to be in the right place at the right time without being intrusive. He does however belabor the point with repetitive slow mo wrecks of the earth bound skiers.\n\nDecades later this compact and uniquely informative sports documentary can hold its own with any made since then. \n\n***\n\nFor screenshots, see the announce at http://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/\n\nEnjoy !\n\n\n************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
