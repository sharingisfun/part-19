And he'd like to tell you what he thinks about some of the most awe-inspiring, earth-shatteringly fast and jaw-droppingly gorgeous cars in the world (alongside a few irredeemable disasters ...). Or he would, if there weren't so many things competing for his attention first. So much to get off his chest. The world according to Clarkson is a perplexing place, filled with thorny subjects like: the prospect of having Terry Wogan as president; why you'll never see a woman driving a Lexus; the unforeseen consequences of inadequate birth control; and, why everyone should spend a weekend with a digger Fearless, independent, surprising and laugh-out-loud funny. &quot;Driven to Distraction&quot; is full-throttle Clarkson at his best; a unique look at the joys, absurdities and frustrations of modern life. With wheels. Buckle up, get comfortable, and hold on tight. There's no one who writes about cars like Jeremy...\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJeremy Clarkson began his writing career on the Rotherham Advertiser.
