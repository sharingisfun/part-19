After burying the loot, they find their way to a surreal town full of cowboys who drink an awful lot of coffee. The townspeople are hostile to the outsiders at first, but seem to accept them once they&amp;#039;ve killed a couple of people. After a while, a mysterious man named Dade arrives, who seems to have unpleasant business to settle with the robbers. A free-for-all shoot-em-up ensues.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83c7eb21b41fd313b3064fd8c5c722f63f9b36e6","amp;dn":"Straight+to+Hell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83c7eb21b41fd313b3064fd8c5c722f63f9b36e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,199,235,33,180,31,211,19,179,6,79,216,197,199,34,246,63,155,54,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
