Combining Pryor's viciously acute observational gifts and love of obscenities with Cosby's undeniable mainstream appeal, Murphy quickly leaped from clubs to television to film -- even finding success as a serious pop singer -- on the way to establishing himself as the most wildly popular comedian since the heyday of Steve Martin. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia\nCatalog:\t\tCOL 487227 2\nContains:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.The Barbecue\n02.Drinking Fathers\n03.Singers\n04.Old Jew\n05.Ice Cream Man\n06.Boxers\n07.Hit By A Car\n08.Cumin' Hard\n09.Skeleton In Closet\n10.Grandma Klump\n11.Buckwheat\n12.Niggaz In The 70's\n13.Moses\n14.Lost In Space\n15.Little Richard\n16.Black Sambo\n17.Almost F****d A Midget\n18.Seeing Birth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26121bd874c5c85e2515b46e7e2396881551038a","amp;dn":"Eddie+Murphy+-+Greatest+Comedy+Hits+%281997%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26121bd874c5c85e2515b46e7e2396881551038a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,18,27,216,116,197,200,94,37,21,180,110,126,35,150,136,21,81,3,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
