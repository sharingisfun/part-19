If you experience system crashes, error messages or\nother incorrect behavior, we suggest you first try one of the following:\n\n1) Upgrade your computer&amp;#039;s sound card drivers. This can be done by identifying\nthe type of sound card your computer is using and finding the manufacturer&amp;#039;s web\nsite. Or, most drivers will be automatically updated if you follow step #2.\n\n2) Upgrade DirectX. This is a Microsoft component and it includes special\ndrivers for video cards and sound cards for virtually every manufacturer. It is\ntherefore a very large download, but updating DirectX solves nearly all system\nproblems encountered with GameHouse games.\n\nDirectX Home Page: http://www.microsoft.com/directx/\n\nIf Chainz crashes for some reason, a window may appear where you can enter\nyour e-mail address and report the problem to MumboJumbo.
