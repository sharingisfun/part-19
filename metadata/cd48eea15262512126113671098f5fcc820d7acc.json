La Mujer De Los Dos \n\nHoney-sweet singing, lovely melodies, and good production values make this a terrific addition to my Mexican music collection in the &quot;grupo&quot; genre. Los Temerarios have been going strong for over 20 years, and are led by Gustavo Angel (vocals and guitar) and his older brother Adolfo Angel (keyboards). They write all the material and perform it to perfection. If you like this type of romantic balada, Los Temerarios are the best.\n\nThe lyrics are all about lost love, and tend to be exceedingly sappy, but are sung with such emotional conviction that it gives them an innocent, naive charm, and musically it is outstanding, making for very satisfying, easy listening.\nThough the themes are heartbreak and loneliness, it is a peaceful and uplifting CD; the songs are moderately slow throughout, with a good steady beat, wonderful for background music and an ideal CD to keep in your car, calming the mood even when driving in the crunch of downtown Los Angeles traffic.\n\nHighlights for me are &quot;Enamorada de Ti&quot;, &quot;Quise Olvidarme de Ti&quot;, and the beautiful &quot;Mi Vida Eres Tu&quot;, but there are no weak songs on this CD, and Gustavo&amp;#039;s clear, high voice is a delight.\nThe booklet insert has all the lyrics and diffused photos of the brothers. The sound is first-rate and total playing time 58&amp;#039;07.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd48eea15262512126113671098f5fcc820d7acc","amp;dn":"Los+Temerarios+-+Tributo+al+Amor+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd48eea15262512126113671098f5fcc820d7acc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,72,238,161,82,98,81,33,38,17,54,113,9,143,95,204,130,13,122,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
