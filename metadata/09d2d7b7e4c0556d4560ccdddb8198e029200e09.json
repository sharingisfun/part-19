Edmond Dantes is falsely accused by those jealous of his good fortune, and is sentenced to spend the rest of his life in the notorious island prison, Chateau d\\&amp;#039;If. While imprisoned, he meets the Abbe Faria, a fellow prisoner whom everyone believes to be mad. The Abbe tells Edmond of a fantastic treasure hidden away on a tiny island, that only he knows the location of. After many years in prison, the old Abbe dies, and Edmond escapes disguised as the dead body. Now free, Edmond must find the treasure the Abbe told him of, so he can use the new-found wealth to exact revenge on those who have wronged him.\n\nReviews:\nClassy cast, classic tale as only the French can do it:), 9 December 1999\n10/10\nAuthor: Missy C from Indianapolis, IN\n\nWhen this mini-series premiered on Bravo last June, I was hooked. I\\&amp;#039;ve watched some of the great mini-series such as \\&quot;Roots\\&quot; and \\&quot;Thorn Birds\\&quot;, but this one is my all-time favorite. I grew up reading the Dumas books and even wrote a paper on \\&quot;Count\\&quot; for my senior English class. It\\&amp;#039;s been nearly 25 years since then (!) but this production brought it all back.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09d2d7b7e4c0556d4560ccdddb8198e029200e09","amp;dn":"The+Count+of+Monte+Cristo+-+Le+Comte+de+Monte+Cristo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09d2d7b7e4c0556d4560ccdddb8198e029200e09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,210,215,183,228,192,85,109,69,96,204,221,219,129,152,224,41,32,14,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
