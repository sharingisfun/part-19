It takes a while to get to know it and in several songs, the &quot;catchiness&quot; of the Suede sound is a little more hidden than usual. You do get your traditional hit anthems, though, with songs like &quot;We Are The Pigs&quot;, &quot;The Wild Ones&quot; and &quot;Heroine&quot;. That Bernard Butler left the band after the recording of &quot;Dog Man Star&quot; took away some of the experimental identity of Suede. Ironically enough, that's when the band became huge all over Europe and success started pouring in. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 89\nArtist: Suede\nAlbum: Dog Man Star\nYear: 1994\nGenre: Pop/Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee9575fa6a098765c54de26092deff911fdb62f","amp;dn":"Suede+-+Dog+Man+Star+%5BFLAC-1994%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee9575fa6a098765c54de26092deff911fdb62f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,233,87,95,166,160,152,118,92,84,222,38,9,45,239,249,17,253,182,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
