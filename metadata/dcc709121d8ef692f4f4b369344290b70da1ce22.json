The idea of crimes comes to her when she is able safely to return a fur which has been given to her as a present by her devoted maid Lily (Billie Whitelaw), a reformed thief who is now going steady with a policeman.\n\nHer 'gang' consists of Albert (Terry-Thomas), a retired officer who plans the raids along strictly military lines, a daffy spinster (Elspeth Duxbury), and Nanette (Hattie Jacques), a heavyweight teacher of deportment. This unlikely quartet carry off several daring raids.\n\nThe humor is episodic, but Robert Asher has directed the lively screenplay briskly enough, and the camerawork is okay. The four members of the gang do their chores admirably, with Seyler outstanding.\n\nPlease Seed thank you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcc709121d8ef692f4f4b369344290b70da1ce22","amp;dn":"Make+Mine+Mink+%281960+Terry+Thomas%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcc709121d8ef692f4f4b369344290b70da1ce22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,199,9,18,29,142,246,146,244,244,179,105,52,66,144,183,13,161,206,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
