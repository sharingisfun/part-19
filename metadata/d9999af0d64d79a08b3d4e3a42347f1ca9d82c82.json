Add to these a smattering of students, lecturers, the regular love interests for Dr Daker (Lyn in Series 1, and Greta in Series 2) and the strangely compelling nuns that roamed the campus causing mayhem. Then throw in plots that cause emotional, physical, or mental reactions, and sit back to watch.\n\nSeries one\n\n1 A Very Long Way From Anywhere (5/21/1986) \n2 We Love You, That\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Why Were Here (5/28/1986D)\n3 Wives of Great Men (6/4/1986) \n4 Black Bob\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Hamburger Suit (6/10/1986)\n5 Contact Tracer (6/17/1986) \t\n6 The Hit List (6/24/1986) \t\n7 Catastrophe Theory (7/2/1986)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9999af0d64d79a08b3d4e3a42347f1ca9d82c82","amp;dn":"A+Very+Peculiar+Practice%2C+Series+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9999af0d64d79a08b3d4e3a42347f1ca9d82c82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,153,154,240,214,77,121,160,139,61,78,58,66,52,127,28,169,216,44,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
