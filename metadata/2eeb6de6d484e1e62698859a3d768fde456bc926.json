To her father and her married lover, she's a student. In reality, she often travels to Mexico where she can legally buy a powerful barbiturate. Working under the name of Miele (&quot;Honey&quot;), her clandestine job is to help terminally-ill people to die with dignity by giving them the drug. One day she supplies a new &quot;client&quot; with a fatal dose, only to find out he's perfectly healthy but tired of life. Irene is determined not to be responsible for his suicide.
