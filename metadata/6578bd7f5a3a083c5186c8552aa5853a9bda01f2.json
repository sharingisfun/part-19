Every person on the planet walks around with opinions based on what they think they know, and those opinions direct how all of us act and react. But very few ever question the substance that forms those crucial opinions. From the very nature of truth to how our world began, from morality to religion, from population control to political correctness, from Israel to Islam, from atheism to God... our entire world runs on what we believe. Follow the popular actor and host Kevin Sorbo as he introduces some of the world's leading scientists, historians, theologians, philosophers and authors, as they tackle the world's 12 Biggest lies.\n\nThis DVD also contains the included follow-up video titled The Truth Behind The Lies which expands on the topic.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Theory of Everything:\nThe Theory of Everything: &quot;Michio Kaku &amp; Steven Hawking have interesting ideas, however, this video veers less to the direction of Darwin &amp; the &quot;extremely&quot; improbable -- more in the direction perhaps of those such as Sir Roger Penrose (a Steven Hawking's mentor), Steven Meyer (ID), Niels Bohr (atomic structure), Sir John Eccles (Nobel Prize for consciousness), Max Planck (father of Quantum Physics), Albert Einstein (Relativity), Thomas Aquinas, Aristotle (teacher of Alexander the Great), Plato (student of Aristotle) -- and (above all) -- Jesus Christ. &quot; ----- a review / quote we liked from a friend at NASA\n\nThe Theory of Everything: Universe in a Nutshell: Enjoy this EASY journey through the Universe in a Nutshell from the cells to the stars.... time, space, angels, devils, heaven, hell and the dimensions between...\n\nThe Theory of Everything DOES cover sensitive topics such as Evolution, Time, Space, Dimensions, Quantum Physics, Measurement Problem, Synthetic Universe, Digital Universe, Holographic Universe, Big Bang theory, Multi-universe / Multiverse theory, Darwin theory, and even ancient texts / Prophecy that line up eerily with modern scientific knowledge. The Theory of Everything: God, Devils, Dimensions &amp; Man is a journey through the blurry lines between science and spiritual.\n\nThe Theory of Everything: God, Devils, Dimensions &amp; Man is a journey through the blurry lines between science and spiritual. Is God proven by our current sciences of Quantum Physics, Conciousness, the Holographic Universe, DNA, Illusion of Reality, and evidence that reality itself is an intelligently designed digital simulation as was believed by many of the greatest minds that ever lived (Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Plato, Aristotle) Perhaps mankind living a test?\n\nThe Theory of Everything also covers the deepest regions of Egyptian, Babylonian Occult leading even to what some may call the Illuminati. Reality of the Occult, Fallen Angels, Demons, Aliens, Ancient Dinosaur Dragons and Dimensions through-out ages past.\n\nThe Theory of Everything is a journey from the cells to the stars, heaven, hell and the dimensions between.\n\nThe Theory of Everything also takes a hard, sobering look at some of our &quot;fringe sciences &amp; mythologies&quot; such as Darwin's 1859 Theory of Evolution and the Big Bang which many feel may not meet the minimum bar of current scientific knowledge?\n\nThe Theory of Everything discusses many aspects of the biological and cosmological sciences and how GOD is now SCIENCE FACT (FULL) God, Devils, Dimensions &amp; the Illusion of Reality.

Evolutionists have a number of theories about how life began, and on this program Eric and Paul examine another one of the more unusual ones Ã¢â‚¬â€ Panspermia!\n\nPart 3 - Did life originate from non-living organic compounds? Evolutionists have a number of ideas where life came from that areÃ¢â‚¬â€well, pretty amusing!

Using an list of requirements for 'science' from a popular evolutionist textbook we examine evolution to see whether it meets the requirements.\n\nRelated Articles:\nWhat distinguishes origins and operational science?
