Unfortunately there are Dutch subs throughout the movie. To my knowledge this movie has yet to come out on DVD and the subtitles don&amp;#039;t really detract from the quality of this rare movie. Film is based on a book by Roald Dahl, the man behind Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Enjoy\n\nSomewhere in England, in the Autumn of 1955, a widowed father and his son live an idyllic life together. Only their gas station happens to sit on a piece of land that a local developer wants to buy. And when he won&amp;#039;t take no for an answer, and sets government inspectors and social works onto Danny and his father, Danny and his father decide to get even with Hazell and his pheasant- shooting friends in a manner in keeping with their own family tradition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1e46eeb25770a3619a2c5b572417b31231e5b6","amp;dn":"Disney+TV+Movie+-+Danny+the+Champion+of+the+World+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1e46eeb25770a3619a2c5b572417b31231e5b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,30,70,238,178,87,112,163,97,154,44,91,87,36,23,179,18,49,229,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
