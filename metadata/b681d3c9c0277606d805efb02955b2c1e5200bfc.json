Harry Enfield exuberantly returns as 'Dirk Gently', who, fallen on hard times and dressed as a gypsy woman, is using his irritatingly accurate clairvoyant powers to read palms. He is saved when a frantic client turns up with a ludicrous story about being stalked by a goblin waving a contract accompanied by a hairy, green-eyed, scythe-wielding monster. When Detective Superintendent Gilks decides a headless body found in a sealed room is the result of a particularly irritating suicide, Dirk is plunged into a mystery where the interconnectedness of all things is tested to the limit...This is the second of three series adapted from the &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; books, directed by Dirk Maggs (chosen by Douglas Adams to conclude the award-winning &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot;). Guest stars include Peter Davison (&quot;Doctor Who&quot;), Jan Ravens (&quot;Dead Ringers&quot;), Philip Jackson (&quot;Poirot&quot;), John Fortune (&quot;Bremner, Bird &amp; Fortune&quot;), Morwenna Banks (&quot;Absolutely&quot;), Stephen Moore (&quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot;) and returning cast members Olivia Colman (&quot;Peep Show&quot;), Jim Carter (&quot;The Golden Compass&quot;) and Billy Boyd (&quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;). This CD contains over thirty minutes of additional unbroadcast material.\n\nmp3\n64kbs cbr\n22050hz\nSterio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b681d3c9c0277606d805efb02955b2c1e5200bfc","amp;dn":"Dirk+Gently+Long+dark+teatime+of+the+soul+Audio+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b681d3c9c0277606d805efb02955b2c1e5200bfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,129,211,201,192,39,118,6,216,5,239,176,41,85,178,193,229,32,11,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
