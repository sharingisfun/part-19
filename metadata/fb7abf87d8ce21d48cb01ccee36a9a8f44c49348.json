The ORTF (french public TV) broadcast this programme called Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«psychanalyseÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â». Then, this intervention was re-written and published in 1974 under the name TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vision. This programme and the text which stemmed from it became famous because this is the only real televisual practise by Lacan. The way he (hardly) tries to adapt himself to TVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prosody provides us a video-object just as strange as singular.\n\nTackled themes here are far from being completely new for a regular SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©minaireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s listener (no crucial question is missing for the ones who have attended the SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©minaire for 10 years), but the TV spectator canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make head or tail of LacanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style (such a different style than he has during his SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©minaire) and of the too-quickly-declaimed LacanianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aphorisms. Though this TV show appears obscure, we canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t deny its extreme preciseness, even if it causes some uneasiness on both sides of the screen. Nevertheless, this archive has a rare intensity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb7abf87d8ce21d48cb01ccee36a9a8f44c49348","amp;dn":"Television+%28Jacques+Lacan%2C+1973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb7abf87d8ce21d48cb01ccee36a9a8f44c49348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,122,191,135,216,206,33,212,140,176,28,206,227,106,154,143,68,196,147,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
