Barker devotees have been waiting for The Scarlet Gospels with bated breath for years, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everything they've begged for and more. Bloody, terrifying, and brilliantly complex, fans and newcomers alike will not be disappointed by the epic, visionary tale that is The Scarlet Gospels. Barker's horror will make your worst nightmares seem like bedtime stories. The Gospels are coming. Are you ready?\n\nRead by John Lee\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\n------------------------------\nVisit us:\n\n.:www.audiobookvault.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b2b466a84592295675ba32613f629898feca693","amp;dn":"The+Scarlet+Gospels+-+Clive+Barker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b2b466a84592295675ba32613f629898feca693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,43,70,106,132,89,34,149,103,91,163,38,19,246,41,137,143,236,166,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
