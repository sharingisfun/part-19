The end of civilization as we know it? Are the current staggeringly expensive actions now being considered really helping to save the world - or are we just burning money? In this &quot;eye-opening&quot; (Los Angeles Times) documentary, author Bjorn Lomborg (&quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;) asks us to question the facts and the solutions. Why in the world are we spending so much money on &quot;green&quot; initiatives for such little gain? Are there better ways to solve the problems? How else could that money be spent? No matter what our opinions are on the environmental movement, Cool It is an &quot;engrossing&quot; film (The New York Times) that asks us to rethink our polarized views. After all, nothing less than the planet is at stake.\n\n\nIncludes:\nSample\nTrailer\nExtras\nEnglish and Spanish subtitles\n\nModifications:\nFixed many errors in the English subtitles.\nFixed the frame rate of the extras (was converted from 24fps to 30fps in the wrong way on the DVD).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IN75D0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IN75D0/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1694015/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1694015/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n--- General ---\nFile: Cool It.avi\nFormat: AVI\nFile size: 1.02 GiB\nDuration: 1h 28mn\nOverall bit rate: 1660 Kbps\nSource: DVD\n\n--- Video ---\nCodec: Xvid\nPasses: 2\nBitrate: 1500kb/s\nResolution: 720 x 400\nFrame rate: 23.976 f/s\nPacked bitstream: Yes\nQpel: No\nGMC: No\nInterlaced: No\nPixel asp. ratio: Square\nQuant type: H.263\nMax consec B-VOPs: 1\n\n--- Audio ---\nCodec: mp3 (Lame v3.96)\nBitrate: VBR 147kb/s\nSample Rate: 48000Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef1479f7341366d9a2d9912858a5f8527ad96fc","amp;dn":"Cool+It+%282010%29+-+Bjorn+Lomborg+-+DVDRip+Xvid+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef1479f7341366d9a2d9912858a5f8527ad96fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,241,71,159,115,65,54,109,154,45,153,18,133,138,95,133,39,173,150,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
