As background an undergraduate level of modern applied algebra (Birkhoff-Bartee: Modern Applied Algebra - 1970, and Hartmanis-Stearns: Algebraic Structure of Sequential Machines - 1970) will suffice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c7661c0ace59d8a670fd22536f9822df98e6f15","amp;dn":"Associative+Digital+Network+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c7661c0ace59d8a670fd22536f9822df98e6f15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,118,97,192,172,229,157,138,103,15,210,37,54,249,130,45,249,142,111,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
