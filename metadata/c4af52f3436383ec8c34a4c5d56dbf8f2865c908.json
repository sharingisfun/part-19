Now Cara Sweeney is going to be sharing a bathroom with one of them.\n\nHandpicked to host the first-ever LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢eihr exchange student, Cara thinks her future is set. Not only does she get a free ride to her dream college, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have inside information about the mysterious LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢eihrs that every journalist would kill for. CaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blog following is about to skyrocket.\n\nStill, Cara isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure what to think when she meets Aelyx. Humans and LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢eihrs have nearly identical DNA, but cold, infuriatingly brilliant Aelyx couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem more alien. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain about one thing, though: no human boy is this good-looking.\n\nBut when Cara's classmates get swept up by anti-L'eihr paranoia, Midtown High School suddenly isn't safe anymore. Threatening notes appear in Cara's locker, and a police officer has to escort her and Aelyx to class.\n\nCara finds support in the last person she expected. She realizes that Aelyx isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just her only friend; she's fallen hard for him. But Aelyx has been hiding the truth about the purpose of his exchange, and its potentially deadly consequences. Soon Cara will be in for the fight of her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€not just for herself and the boy she loves, but for the future of her planet.\n \nE-Book : Alienated [Alienated, #01]\nAuthor : Melissa Landers\nLanguage : English\nPublisher : Disney-Hyperion\nISBN-10 : 1423185250\nISBN-13 : 978-1423185253\n \nCOVER :\n \nThe romantic sequel to Alienated takes long-distance relationships to a new level as Cara and Aelyx long for each other from opposite ends of the universe...until a threat to both their worlds reunites them.\n\nCara always knew life on planet LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢eihr would be an adjustment. With Aelyx, her LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢eihr boyfriend, back on Earth, working to mend the broken alliance between their two planets, Cara is left to fend for herself at a new school, surrounded by hostile alien clones. Even the weird dorm pet hates her.\n\nThings look up when Cara is appointed as human representative to a panel preparing for a human colony on LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢eihr. A society melding their two cultures is a place where Cara and Aelyx could one day make a life together. But with LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢eihr leaders balking at granting even the most basic freedoms, Cara begins to wonder if she could ever be happy on this planet, even with Aelyx by her side.\n\nMeanwhile, on Earth, Aelyx, finds himself thrown into a full-scale PR campaign to improve human-LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢eihr relations. Humans donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know that their very survival depends on this alliance: only AelyxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s people have the technology to fix the deadly contamination in the global water supply that human governments are hiding. Yet despite their upper hand, the leaders of his world suddenly seem desperate to get humans on their side, and hardly bat an eye at extremistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ multiple attempts on AelyxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life.\n\nThe Way clearly needs humansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ help . . . but with what? And what will they ask for in return?\n \nE-Book : Invaded [Alienated, #02]\nAuthor : Melissa Landers\nLanguage : English\nPublisher : Disney-Hyperion\nISBN-10 : 1423169492\nISBN-13 : 978-1423169499","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4af52f3436383ec8c34a4c5d56dbf8f2865c908","amp;dn":"Alienated+Series+-+Melissa+Landers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4af52f3436383ec8c34a4c5d56dbf8f2865c908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,175,82,243,67,99,131,236,140,52,164,197,213,109,191,143,40,101,201,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
