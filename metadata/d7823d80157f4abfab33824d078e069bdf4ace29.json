Sukhija \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 768 pages \r\nPublisher: Oxford Univ Pr (Txt); 2 edition (July 2016) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 9780198096337 \r\n\r\n\r\nThe second edition of Power System Analysis serves as a basic text for undergraduate students of electrical engineering. It provides a thorough understanding of the basic principles and techniques of power system analysis as well as their application to real-world problems. Beginning with the basic concepts, the book gives an exhaustive coverage of transmission line parameters, simulation of power system elements, steady-state performance and travelling wave phenomena on transmission lines, symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault analyses, power flow studies, power system control, and stability analysis. The book extensively illustrates the use of MATLAB in the analysis of power systems. Owing to its lucid style and presentation of advanced topics, the book will be useful to postgraduate students as also to practising engineers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7823d80157f4abfab33824d078e069bdf4ace29","amp;dn":"Modern+Power+System+Analysis%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2013%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7823d80157f4abfab33824d078e069bdf4ace29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,130,61,128,21,127,74,191,171,51,130,77,7,142,6,155,223,74,206,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
