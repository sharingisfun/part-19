Being able to &quot;see&quot; in black and white is an enviable capability, and a well-crafted black and white photograph remains the finest of the fine arts. Master photographer Vincent Versace has spent his career teaching the art of perception and how to translate it into extraordinary black and white images.\n\nIn From Oz to Kansas: Almost Every Black and White Conversion Technique Known to Man, Versace discusses digital black and white photographyÃ¢â‚¬â€œwith a nod to traditional film-based techniques. As Versace states, today the goal is &quot;to use what was right and good about silver photography, leaving behind what was limiting, and use what is right and good about digital photography, while avoiding its pitfalls. This is what this book is all about.&quot;\n\nThe reason you must learn &quot;almost every black and white conversion technique known to man&quot; is because, depending on the imageÃ¢â‚¬â€œand your goals for itÃ¢â‚¬â€œthere are many paths you can take in order to arrive at your final destination. Working through VersaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s techniques will give you the essential knowledge you need, as well as the ability to select the appropriate conversion technique for any image, allowing you to create a black and white image that best and most accurately reflects what you felt at the moment that you pressed the shutter.\n\nForeword by Dr. Richard Zakia, Professor Emeritus, Rochester Institute of Technology\n\nAfterword by John Fraser, Chef and Proprietor, Dovetail Restaurant, New York\n\n\n# Paperback: 272 pages\n# Publisher: New Riders; 1 edition (August 28, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321794028\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321794024","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf0c2da2d1cdbdf055a364b795ac01c89b750af0","amp;dn":"From+Oz+to+Kansas++%5BPdf%2FePUB%5D+++%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf0c2da2d1cdbdf055a364b795ac01c89b750af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,12,45,162,209,205,189,240,85,163,100,183,149,172,1,200,155,117,10,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
