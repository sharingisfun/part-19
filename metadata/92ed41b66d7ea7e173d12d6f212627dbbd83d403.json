HELP SEEDING!\n\nPlease comment on this torrent.\n\nAlbum list below.\n\nI donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe that this is a complete discography of Paul McCartney. But I believe it is almost complete regarding official recordings.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ripped my own CDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in 320 bps. The rest is in various bit rates, but it all sounds ok to me. Thanks to all, who has shared McCartney material, without your efforts this torrent wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be possible.\nIf you want FLAC you have to look elsewhere, sorry!\n\nThanks, to all who have put so much effort, in collecting data (and sharing it on the net) about each album: Without you, I could not have created the tag info.\n\nAll file names and tag info has been edited with MP 3 TAG.\n\nI've tried to be consistent in naming the files:  Track no.  Artist - Album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Title  bit rate.\n\nFor a few tracks this has not worked out. The only reason I can think of is that the filename has been too long. So there are a few tracks that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t follow the above pattern. I've had to use some abbreviations to make it work. But there are no problems in identifying the tracks.\nIf you find any errors in tags or filenames, please let me know.\nTo my best knowledge all tracks should be complete.\n\nAll albums come with, at least, front and back covers.\nOnly exceptions are the Percy Thrillington album (front cover only).\nLive at the Cavern Club, Twin Freaks and Electric Arguments, (no covers at all).\n\nFor those of you using Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent I hope you know that you can download only the albums or the individual tracks that you want. When choosing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDownload this torrentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, you should get a dialogue box asking if you want to open or save this file. If you chose open you will get a list of all the albums and the tracks. By ticking the box at the far left you can choose the albums or even the individual tracks from each album that you want to download. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know if this option is available with other clients.\n\nFor more info on Beatles albums, group or individual, visit this great site: http://www.jpgr.co.uk/\n\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find a superb collection of Pauls UK singles at http://thepiratebay.se/user/nightsatsea/\n\n\n1970-04-17  Paul McCartney - McCartney  224bps\n1970-05-21  Paul and Linda McCartney - RAM (2 bonus tracks)  160bps\n1971-12-07  Wings - Wild Life (3 bonus tracks)  192bps\n1973-05-04  Paul McCartney &amp; Wings - Red Rose Speedway (3 bonus tracks)  160bps\n1973-12-07  Paul McCartney &amp; Wings - Band on the Run (2 bonus tracks)  320bps\n1975-05-30  Wings - Venus and Mars (3 bonus tracks)  320bps\n1976-04-09  Wings - Wings At The Speed Of Sound (3 bonus tracks)  160bps\n1976-12-10  Wings - Wings Over America  192bps \n            (Definitely a vinyl rip, but it sounds OK)\n1977-04-29  Percy Thrillington - Thrillington Sealed  256bps (only front cover)\n1978-03-31  Wings - London Town (2 bonus tracks)  vbr  (180 bps or better)\n1978-12-01  Wings - Wings Greatest 320bps\n1979-06-08  Wings - Back To The Egg (3 bonus tracks)  160kbps\n1980-05-16  Paul McCartney - McCartney II  160bps\n1982-04-26  Paul McCartney - Tug of War  320bps\n1983-10-17  Paul McCartney - Pipes Of Peace (3 bonus tracks)  160bps\n1984-10-22  Paul McCartney - Give My Regards To Broad Street (2 bonus tracks)128bps\n1986-09-01  Paul McCartney - Press To Play  160bps\n1987-11-02  Paul McCartney - All The Best (US)  128bps\n1989-06-05  Paul McCartney - Flowers in the Dirt  320bps\n1990-09-30  Paul McCartney - Choba B CCCP  160bps\n1990-11-05  Paul McCartney - Tripping The Live Fantastic  160bps\n1991-05-20  Paul McCartney - Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)  320bps\n1991-10-07  Various Artists - Liverpool Oratorio  160bps\n1993-02-02  Paul McCartney - Off the Ground  320bps\n1993-11-15  Paul McCartney - Paul Is Live  160bps\n1993-11-15  The Fireman - Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest  160bps\n1997-05-05  Paul McCartney - Flaming Pie  320bps\n1997-09-29  London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Lawrence Foster -            Standing Stone  160bps\n1998-09-21  The Fireman -  Rushes  160bps\n1999-03-22  Paul McCartney &amp; Wings - Band On The Run (25th Anniversary)  192bps\n1999-10-04  Paul McCartney - Run Devil Run vbr (190 bps or better)\n1999-11-02  Various Artists - Working Classical  256bps  \n            (London Symphony Orchestra and Loma Mar Quartet)\n1999-12-14  Paul McCartney - Live at the Cavern Club  128bps \n            (No covers.
