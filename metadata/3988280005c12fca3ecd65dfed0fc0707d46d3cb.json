When it became clear that the kingdom would fall regardless, Merlin bound Etrigan to the soul of a man named Jason Blood, making Jason immortal with limited magical power. For hundreds of years Jason has walked the earth, caught in a constant war for power with the Demon trapped within him. Etrigan can be released by chanting a simple poem, but Jason is reluctant to do so unless absolutely necessary. Blood eventually settled in Gotham City where he became known as an expert occultist and demonologist. But Etrigan continues to seek liberation from his human host.\n\nEtrigan The Demon was created by Jack Kirby in 1972 when his Fourth World titles were canceled. Etrigan was inspired by the Hal Foster comic strip of Prince Valiant in which the title character dressed as a demon. Kirby gave his creation the same appearance as Valiant's mask.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3988280005c12fca3ecd65dfed0fc0707d46d3cb","amp;dn":"The+Demon+Etrigan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3988280005c12fca3ecd65dfed0fc0707d46d3cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,136,40,0,5,193,47,202,62,205,101,223,237,15,192,112,125,70,211,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
