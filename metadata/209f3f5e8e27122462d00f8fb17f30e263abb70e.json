On the Berlin-recorded Endless Flowers, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard not to feel that the circles on Welchez and RowellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thematic Venn diagram have been forced together this time around to produce maximum overlap. This self-produced offering has a sunnier disposition than its predecessors, and the recurrent &quot;flower&quot; motif - symbolic of love, death and fragile beauty - provides the album with lyrical focus and continuity. Crucially, their bold decision to expand to a five-piece also delivers sonic cohesion, allowing one propulsive, hook-filled tune to bleed seamlessly into the next. Recalling the Cure at their most carefree, both the bittersweet Ã¢â‚¬Å“Endless FlowersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the crunching slice of power pop that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sunday (Psychic Conversation #9),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are the kind of euphoric set-openers designed to deliver broad appeal. Pleasingly, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a guise that fits them as perfectly as their sunglasses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:209f3f5e8e27122462d00f8fb17f30e263abb70e","amp;dn":"Crocodiles+-+Endless+Flowers+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"209f3f5e8e27122462d00f8fb17f30e263abb70e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,159,63,94,142,39,18,36,98,208,15,143,177,127,48,226,99,171,183,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
