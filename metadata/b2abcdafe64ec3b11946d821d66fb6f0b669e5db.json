A wealth of exercises and applications, coded by trade area, include such trades as machine tool, plumbing, carpentry, electrician, auto mechanic, construction, electronics, metal-working, landscaping, drafting, manufacturing, HVAC, police science, food service, and many other occupational and vocational programs. The authors interviewed trades workers, apprentices, teachers, and training program directors to ensure realistic problems and applications and added over 100 new exercises to this edition. geometry, triangle trigonometry, and advanced algebra. For individuals who will need technical math skills to succeed in a wide variety of trades.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2abcdafe64ec3b11946d821d66fb6f0b669e5db","amp;dn":"Mathematics+for+the+Trades%3A+A+Guided+Approach+%289e%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2abcdafe64ec3b11946d821d66fb6f0b669e5db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,171,205,175,230,78,195,177,25,70,216,33,214,111,182,240,182,105,229,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
