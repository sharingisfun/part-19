In 1962, Trower formed a group that became The Paramounts, later including \nfellow Southend High School pupil Gary Brooker. The Paramounts disbanded in 1966 to pursue individual \nprojects. During this time, Trower created a local three-piece band called 'The Jam' \n(not to be confused with the later group with Paul Weller) Trower then joined Brooker's new band \nProcol Harum following the success of their debut single &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; in 1967, remaining \nwith them until 1971 and appearing on Procol Harum's first five albums.\n\n\n   1.
