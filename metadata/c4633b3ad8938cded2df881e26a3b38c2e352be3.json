The year was 1928, and the setting \na working-class suburb of Los Angeles. As Christine (Angelina Jolie) said goodbye to her \nson, Walter, and departed for work, she never anticipated that this was the day her life \nwould be forever changed. Upon returning home, Christine was distressed to discover that \nWalter was nowhere to be found. Over the course of the following months, the desperate \nmother would launch a search that would ultimately prove fruitless. Yet just when it seemed \nthat all hope was lost, a nine-year-old boy claiming to be Christine's son seemed to appear \nout of thin air. Overcome with emotions and uncertain how to face the authorities or the \npress, Christine invites the child to stay in her home despite knowing without a doubt that \nhe is not her son. As much as Christine would like to accept the fact that her son has been \nreturned to her, she cannot accept the injustice being pushed upon her and continues to \nchallenge the Prohibition-era Los Angeles police force at every turn. As a result, Christine \nis slandered by the powers that be, and painted as an unfit mother. In this town, a woman \nwho challenges the system is putting her life on the line, and as the situation grows \ndesperate, the only person willing to aid her in her search is benevolent local activist \nReverend Briegleb (John Malkovich).\n\nCast : \nAngelina Jolie ...
