The two didn't disappoint; although their marriage was a well-publicized failure, their musical partnership was an unqualified success, producing three number one hits and ten top twenty singles.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY collects all but one of the duo's chart singles (&quot;A Pair of Old Sneakers&quot; is the only hit missing) along with some of Jones and Wynette's better album tracks. All of the recordings are produced by Billy Sherrill, whose taste for slick production is evident throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\tWe're Gonna Hold On\r\n2\tTwo Story House\r\n3\tTake Me\r\n4\tThe Ceremony\r\n5\tOld Fashioned Singing\r\n6\t(We're Not) the Jet Set\r\n7\tWe Loved It Away\r\n8\tGod's Gonna Get'cha (For That)\r\n9\tSomeone I Used To Know\r\n10\tLivin' On Easy Street \t\t\t\r\n11\tGolden Ring\r\n12\tAfter Closing Time\t\t\r\n13\tSomething to Brag About\r\n14\tWe'll Talk About It Later\r\n15\tRoll in My Sweet Baby's Arms\r\n16\tNear You\r\n17\tSouthern California\r\n18\tLet's Build a World Together\r\n19\tAfter the Fire Is Gone\r\n20\tIf We Don't Make It","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45f6e26c63a3064c4ad7c19a9b1ac19a6f4086f6","amp;dn":"George+Jones+%26amp%3B+Tammy+Wynette+-+The+President+And+The","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45f6e26c63a3064c4ad7c19a9b1ac19a6f4086f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,246,226,108,99,163,6,76,74,215,193,154,155,26,193,154,111,64,134,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
