Erratic punctuation. Miss SteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s idea about masterpieces is almost like TS Eliot's effacement of the author's personality in creating a work of poetry. Stein says if you remember you are you, you cannot create a masterpiece. You are limited by your personality and identity. If you efface your identity, you can create a masterpiece. Automatic writing? Sensible ideas are occasionally thrown into what appears to be a random collection of thoughts in stream of consciousness. But the piece is well organized. She moves from defining a masterpiece to explaining why there are so few masterpieces--most writers remember themselves and their identities and therefore cannot produce anything truly original. I guess.\n\nQuote: Ã¢â‚¬Å“And that is what a masterpiece is notÃ¢â‚¬â€it may be unwelcome but it is never dull.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1eebb2c8aac81ac539bd4483a80ee45f5c80dbc","amp;dn":"What+are+Masterpieces+by+Gertrude+Stein+%28Art+Essay%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1eebb2c8aac81ac539bd4483a80ee45f5c80dbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,238,187,44,138,172,129,172,83,155,212,72,58,128,238,69,245,200,13,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
