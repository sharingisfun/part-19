Signed to RCA Records in 1983, the duo released six studio albums between then and 1991. \n\nOne of the most successful acts in country music history, The Judds won five Grammy Awards for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and eight Country Music Association awards. The duo also charted twenty-five singles on the country music charts between 1983 and 2000, fourteen of which went to Number One and six more of which made Top Ten on the same chart. (wikipedia)\n\nWell, once you listen to 'River of Time', you'll feel like you went down and swam in the river of success, for the Judds, that is! This album is the best for taking road trips, doing your homework, etc. Each song is nostalgic and dreamy. The Judds know how to pull feeling, not only in their voices but also with the catchy guitar playing accompanying their harmonies\n(review, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nJudds - River of Time 1989\n(Curb Records)\n\n 1.
