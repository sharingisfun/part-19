To read it is to revisit a glorious, glamorous era of high drama (drug busts and brawls with bouncers) and low comedy (how Kane locked himself out of his studio one winter night while in full Dolls drag and tripping on LSD). This distinctive and extroverted memoir of an undisciplined showman is supplemented with a foreword and epilogue by KaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow, Barbara, bringing his full story to light. Never has there been a rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll memoir like this oneÃ¢â‚¬â€a book that captures the music, the style, and the life in all its foolhardy glory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68254a84c8196f80aacd85dec7347706b000575c","amp;dn":"Arthur+Killer+Kane%2C+I%2C+Doll%3A+Life+and+Death+with+the+New+York+Do","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68254a84c8196f80aacd85dec7347706b000575c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,37,74,132,200,25,111,128,170,205,133,222,199,52,119,6,176,0,87,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
