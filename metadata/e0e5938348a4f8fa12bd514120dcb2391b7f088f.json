Remarkable footage, thought never to have existed, this DVD captures part of DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance that day, as well as some other appearances that year beginning with DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spot on The Johnny Cash Show on May 1st, 1969, performing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Threw It All AwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLiving the BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and dueting with Cash on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGirl From the North CountryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Then comes the all-important Isle Of Wight footage. In 1969, the Isle of Wight pop festival was Bob DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s festival. This amazing footage is all that we have of DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance that day, and features the following tracks: The Weight (The Band), I Threw It All Away, Highway 61 Revisited, One Too Many Mornings, I Pity The Poor Immigrant, Minstrel Boy (cut). Rumor has it that this black and white footage was shot by a friend of John LennonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s who sat between him and Yoko at the foot of the stage. Whether this is true or not, the picture and sound are remarkably good. The DVD continues with a handful of newsreels from the Isle Of Wight Festival, featuring still more footage of Dylan that day. The DVD rounds off with some footage of The Band live at the Syria Mosque in Pittsburgh in November 1970, shot in color for Dutch television: Time To Kill, The Weight, This WheelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s On Fire and Up On Cripple Creek. \n\n\nVIDEO: NTSC (29.97), 720x480, 10080 kb/s VBR. \nAUDIO: AC3, 256 kb/s, 2 chnls.\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST \n\nJohnny Cash Show ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ABC TV 01-05-69\n\nI Threw It All Away\nLiving The Blues\nGirl From The North Country\n\nIsle Of Wight Festival ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sunday 31-08-69\n\nThe Weight (The Band)\nI Threw It All Away\nHighway 61 Revisited\nOne Too Many Mornings\nI Pity The Poor Immigrant\nMinstrel Boy (cut)\n\nIsle Of Wight Festival ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Newsreels\n\nThe Band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Syra Mosque Pittsburgh November 1970 From Dutch TV\nTime To Kill\nThe Weight\nThis Wheels On Fire\nUp On Cripple Creek\n\n\nThis is a compilation -- some pro-shot and some aud-shot video. \n\nBig thanks to jefferson.\n\n\n\n\n          ** If you like a screenshot based moviequiz = Please visit **\n                  \n                ** &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=9004&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=9004&lt;/a&gt;  **\n\n\n           ** my uploads &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=16588&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=16588&lt;/a&gt; **\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e5938348a4f8fa12bd514120dcb2391b7f088f","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+and+The+Band+1969-1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e5938348a4f8fa12bd514120dcb2391b7f088f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,229,147,131,72,164,248,250,18,189,81,65,32,220,178,57,27,127,8,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
