Until he meets Christine, a run-down 1958 Plymouth Fury and buys her. Arnie learns that Christine has a thing for him and devotes his time to restoring her to Mint Condition. But overtime, Arnie begins to change and becomes disconnected with reality and his friends. Arnie&amp;#039;s girlfriend Leigh and best friend Dennis find out that Christine&amp;#039;s previous owner cared about nothing else when he bought her and find out that Arnie is becoming just like him. The only way they can bring Arnie back to reality is to destroy Christine, But Arnie and Christine are ready to destroy them first and any one else who gets in their way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e04a05c8b6c46dc2e941302e9db56618ac4ce3","amp;dn":"STEPHEN+KING%5C%27S+CHRISTINE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e04a05c8b6c46dc2e941302e9db56618ac4ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,224,74,5,200,182,196,109,194,233,65,48,46,157,181,102,24,172,76,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
