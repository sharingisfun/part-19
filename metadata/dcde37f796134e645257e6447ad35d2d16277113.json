Her friend Edith (Ethel Merman), Uncle Hubert (Leon Errol), and Princes Michael (Ray Milland) and Alexander make it to the same island but all prove to be useless in the art of survival. The sailor is the only one with the practical knowhow to survive, but Doris and the others snub his leadership offer.
