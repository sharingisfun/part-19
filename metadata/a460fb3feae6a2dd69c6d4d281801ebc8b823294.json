Santa's sleigh will not fly, but by adopting and loving this virtual reindeer pet, you can help create the Christmas magic that will help SantaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleigh lift off the ground on Christmas Eve! Once you adopt a virtual reindeer, you can interact with it to fill the Christmas Magic MeterÃ¢â€žÂ¢. You can also earn Elf PetsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Care BadgesÃ¢â€žÂ¢ in two ways: 1. By loving and nurturing this app's virtual reindeer, and 2. By caring for the real reindeer pet included in the Elf PetsÃ¢â€žÂ¢: A Reindeer Tradition box set. Use this app to do your part to help SantaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleigh fly! \n\nThe Elf PetsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Reindeer App's VIRTUAL CARE ACTIVITIES: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ FEEDÃ¢â‚¬â€Make sure your growing reindeer has all the nutrition it needs to be strong enough to pull Santa's sleigh. Drag food items to your reindeer's mouth and watch it eat. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ WASHÃ¢â‚¬â€The reindeer have been training hard, and have gotten a little dirty. Make sure your Elf PetsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Reindeer is sparkling clean by swiping the sponge back and forth to wash them. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ LOVEÃ¢â‚¬â€Watch the love meter increase each time you pet your beloved reindeer, and you'll see your reindeer's expressions change to match! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ RESTÃ¢â‚¬â€After training hard with Santa, your reindeer needs to rest. Turn off the lights, cover your reindeer with a blanket and watch as your tired little reindeer rests up for another big day. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ PLAYÃ¢â‚¬â€The elves love a good game! Play in two different ways: Visit the reindeer stables and figure out where each stable object goes by dragging it to the matching shape, or help the scout elves sort the reindeer food! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ CARE BADGESÃ¢â€žÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€Earn badges for continually taking care of your Elf PetsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Reindeer to help it grow big and strong for SantaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Christmas Eve flight! Whether it's the Beginner Feeding Badge, or the Master Washing Badge, each and every badge adds Christmas spirit to the Christmas Magic MeterÃ¢â€žÂ¢. Once the meter fills to 100%, you've contributed enough to help Santa's sleigh soar!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a460fb3feae6a2dd69c6d4d281801ebc8b823294","amp;dn":"Elf+Pets+Reindeer+-+Elf+on+the+Shelf%26reg%3B+-+Virtual+Pet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a460fb3feae6a2dd69c6d4d281801ebc8b823294","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,96,251,63,234,230,162,221,105,198,212,210,129,128,30,188,139,130,50,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
