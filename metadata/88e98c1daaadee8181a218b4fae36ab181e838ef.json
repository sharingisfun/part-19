We hear more of Ryuichi Sakamoto's piano on this record than on, say, Vrioon or Insen. Whether it's the piano stuttering on Siisx, or its mysterious variation on Mur (Siisx &amp; Mur are really one piece broken into two movements), or the incredibly innovative remix of Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence on Ax Mr.L., Noto &amp; Sakamoto are clearly artistic collaborators of the highest order. I definitely recommend this CD to listeners who are not averse to, for lack of a better phrase, unconventional music.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e98c1daaadee8181a218b4fae36ab181e838ef","amp;dn":"Alva+Noto+%26+Ryuichi+Sakamoto+%5B2006%5D+Revep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e98c1daaadee8181a218b4fae36ab181e838ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,233,140,29,170,173,238,129,129,162,24,180,250,227,106,177,129,232,56,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
