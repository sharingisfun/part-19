Creating websites was a balancing act between visual content Ã¢â‚¬â€ images, sound, and video Ã¢â‚¬â€ and the overall size of\nthe files that made up my web pages. Gradually, though, computer screen resolutions got higher and higher. and high-speed Internet\nconnections became increasingly more common. Web designers were set free to create highly visual websites, complete with digital video,\nFlash content, and lots of images.\nAlong come web-enabled cellphones and other mobile devices Ã¢â‚¬â€ with even smaller, low-resolution screens, lower bandwidth, and puny\nprocessors. Now, the design restrictions became even greater than when the Web first came into existence. Media files had to be even\nsmaller, and very few of the features we had come used to deploying Ã¢â‚¬â€ big, nice-looking images, digital video, Flash content Ã¢â‚¬â€ were\nsupported on these small devices.\nThe good news is that mobile technology is advancing very rapidly. The latest round of smartphones and handheld computers Ã¢â‚¬â€ tablets Ã¢â‚¬â€\nhave nice, high-resolution screens. The processors get faster every day. The latest round of iPhones, iPads, Android smartphones, and\ntablets support nearly every web feature supported by desktop computers. They also support Wi-Fi and 3G and 4G data networks. Designing\nfor these devices is no longer an exercise in restraint.\nNot every mobile user has jumped into the latest round of handheld devices, though. That's why this book looks backward and forward. To\nallow as many mobile users as possible to view your website, you really do need to create pages that take advantage of the latest\ntechnologies and compensate for earlier technologies. It's important to create mobile websites that meet the expectations of the users of\nthe newer devices, and, at the same time, counterbalance the limitations of the older devices.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a7e5491a29f64ad8d9693e50d7abcdc051e036","amp;dn":"HTML.CSS.and.JavaScript.Mobile.Web.Development.For.Dummies%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a7e5491a29f64ad8d9693e50d7abcdc051e036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,167,229,73,26,41,246,74,216,217,105,62,80,215,171,205,192,81,224,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
