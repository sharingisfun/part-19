Froeb/McCann's MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS: A PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH, 2E covers traditional material using a problem-based pedagogy built around common business mistakes. Models are used sparingly, and then only to the extent that they help students figure out why mistakes are made, and how to fix them. This edition's succinct, fast-paced presentation and challenging, interactive applications place students in the role of a decision maker who has to identify mistakes that reduce profits, and propose solutions to bring profits back up. \n\nThe lively book provides an excellent ongoing reference for students pursuing business careers. New chapters and updates highlight mistakes that precipitated the financial crisis. With MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS, 2E your students are taught to use economics to not only identify profitable decisions, but also how to implement them within an organization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f3e1f6a58a397de1091dc3e83c0e3ec8b2d54ca","amp;dn":"Managerial.Economics.A.Problem-Solving.Approach.2nd.Edition.BD.p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f3e1f6a58a397de1091dc3e83c0e3ec8b2d54ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,62,31,106,88,163,151,222,16,145,220,62,131,192,227,236,139,45,84,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
