As far as I can tell, it first started popping up in trading circles only about 6 years ago, having been cleaned up and sound adjusted along the way. The end result is a crisp-sounding, high-octaned show that just rips.\n\nPlaying the ballroom circuit, as opposed to festival or televised slots, usually meant Freddie had the time and space to stretch out, as he treats us to here, producing a two-disc beast of a show that comes on strong and keeps on swinging.\n\n\n\n\n\nCD1:\n\n01 - Big Legged Woman\n02 - Hey Baby-TV Mama\n03 - Look On Yonder Wall\n04 - Woman Across The River\n05 - San-Ho-Zay\n06 - Have You Ever Loved A Woman\n07 - Rock Me Baby-Have You Ever Loved A Woman\n\n\nCD2:\n\n01 - Goin' Down\n02 - Sweet Home Chicago-Hey Baby-Palace Of The King\n03 - Please Accept My Love\n04 - Jam-Chat\n05 - Shake Your Booty\n06 - Hideaway-Mojo Boogie\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:934d697df7f2258ff92c5bbf8196753b71069fa9","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Freddie+King+-+Live+At+Cain%5C%27s+Ballroom+%281975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"934d697df7f2258ff92c5bbf8196753b71069fa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,77,105,125,247,242,37,143,249,44,91,191,129,150,117,59,113,6,159,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
