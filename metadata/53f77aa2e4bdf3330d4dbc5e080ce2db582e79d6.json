Fleeing vengeful fans, he finds \nrefuge in the grungiest corner of professional football, \nthe Italian National Football League as quarterback \nof the inept but full-of-heart Parma Panthers. What \nensues is a winsome football fable, replete with team \nbonding and character-building as the underdog \nPanthers challenge the powerhouse Bergamo Lions \nfor a shot at the Italian Superbowl. The book is also \nthe author&amp;#039;s love letter to Italy. Rick is first baffled \nand then enchanted by all things Italian-tiny cars! \nopera! benign corruption!-and through him Grisham \n(The Firm) instructs his readership in the art of gracious \nliving, featuring sumptuous four-hour, umpteen-course \nmeals. The writing sometimes lapses into travel-guide \n(&quot;most Italian cities are sort of configured around a \ncentral square, called a piazza&quot;) and food porn \n(&quot;the veal cutlets are beaten with a small bat, then \ndipped in eggs, fried in a skillet, and then baked in \nthe oven with a mix of parmigiano cheese and stock \nuntil the cheese melts&quot;), but it&amp;#039;s invigorated by appealing \ncharacters and lively play-by-play. The result is a charming \nfish-out-of-water story.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53f77aa2e4bdf3330d4dbc5e080ce2db582e79d6","amp;dn":"john+grisham+-+playing+for+pizza+%28unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53f77aa2e4bdf3330d4dbc5e080ce2db582e79d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,247,122,162,228,189,243,51,13,77,188,94,8,12,226,219,88,46,121,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
