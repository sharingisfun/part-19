He wreaks havoc and destruction as surely as a hurricane wherever he goes. Commando Central has planted an electrode transmitter-receiver deep inside his brain and infiltrated him into the Destroyer Spacefleet to prevent it from gaining absolute mastery of the galaxy. But Bron's own brand of chaos is lethally unpredictable. And when whole planets are annihilated by monster hellburner bombs set on course seven hundred million years ago from distant Andromeda, aimed directly at Bron himself, both sides realise something more colossal, more threatening and infinitely more powerful is taking a hand in Bron's weird destiny...\n\n\nThe Patterns of Chaos is a 1972 science fiction novel by Colin Kapp. It originally appeared in If magazine, serialized in three parts. It combines grand space operatic themes of battle between space empires and intergalactic alien invasion with philosophical themes of predestination and destiny, and detailed character development of a tight set of central characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b17cfd3c46c0936ac932b8bf407acd4a86f627","amp;dn":"Patterns+of+Chaos+-+Colin+Kapp+%5BEPUB-MOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b17cfd3c46c0936ac932b8bf407acd4a86f627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,177,124,253,60,70,192,147,106,201,50,184,191,64,122,205,74,134,246,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
