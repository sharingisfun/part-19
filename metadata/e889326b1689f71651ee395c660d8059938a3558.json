Clever, kindhearted Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson of Game of Thrones) ekes out a humble living, telling stories to the people of his seaside town including Hosato (George Takei), Hashi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and Kamekichi (Academy Award nominee Brenda Vaccaro). But his relatively quiet existence is shattered when he accidentally summons a spirit from his past which storms down from the heavens to enforce an age-old vendetta. Now on the run, Kubo joins forces with Monkey (Academy Award winner Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey), and sets out on a thrilling quest to save his family and solve the mystery of his fallen father, the greatest samurai warrior the world has ever known. With the help of his shamisenâ€”a magical musical instrumentâ€”Kubo must battle gods and monsters, including the vengeful Moon King (Academy Award nominee Ralph Fiennes) and the evil twin Sisters (Academy Award nominee Rooney Mara) to unlock the secret of his legacy, reunite his family and fulfill his heroic destiny.\r\n\r\nDirector: Travis Knight\r\n\r\nWriters: Chris Butler, Marc Haimes\r\n\r\nActors: Art Parkinson, Matthew McConaughey, Charlize Theron, Rooney Mara, Ralph Fiennes, George Takei, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Brenda Vaccaro\r\n\r\nGenre: Action and Adventure, Fantasy, Family\r\n\r\nStudio: Â© 2016 Focus Features","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e889326b1689f71651ee395c660d8059938a3558","amp;dn":"Kubo+and+the+Two+Strings.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%233+%5BHD%5D+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e889326b1689f71651ee395c660d8059938a3558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,137,50,107,22,137,247,22,81,238,57,92,102,13,128,89,147,138,53,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
