She is best known for her children's stories, in particular Little Lord Fauntleroy (published in 1885-6), A Little Princess (1905), and The Secret Garden (1911).\n\nBurnettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first novel, That Lass oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ LowrieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, which had been serialized in ScribnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, was published in 1877. Like her short stories, the book combined a remarkable gift for realistic detail in portraying scenes of working-class lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€unusual in that dayÃ¢â‚¬â€with a plot consisting of the most romantic and improbable of turns.\n\nIn 1886 BurnettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous and successful book appeared. First serialized in St. Nicholas magazine, Little Lord Fauntleroy was intended as a childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, but it had its greatest appeal to mothers. It established the main characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long curls (based on her son VivianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s) and velvet suit with lace collar (based on Oscar WildeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attire) as a motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s model for small boys, who generally hated it. The book sold more than half a million copies, and BurnettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s income was increased by her dramatized version, which quickly became a repertory standard on the order of Uncle TomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cabin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a230fd2aa4ceef1cda278802ea2596ad20b2fd2","amp;dn":"Frances+Hodgson+Burnett+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a230fd2aa4ceef1cda278802ea2596ad20b2fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,35,15,210,170,76,238,241,205,162,120,128,46,162,89,106,210,11,47,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
