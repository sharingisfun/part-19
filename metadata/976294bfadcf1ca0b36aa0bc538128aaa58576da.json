If you don&amp;#039;t know who this is, I highly recommend downloading it, he is definitely one of my favorites, if not my absolute favorite. The cd listing is as follows:\n\nx/o\nelliott smith\nRoman Candle + Division Day - No Name #6\nFrom a Basement on The Hill\nFigure 8\nFrom a Basement on the Hill 2\nEither Or\n\nnow, if you know anything abotu elliott smith, you probably know that there is no such thing as from a basement on the hill 2, but this is a compilation of other songs he recorded that never made it on a cd, and has some of my personal favorites (including the cat stevens cover Trouble)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:976294bfadcf1ca0b36aa0bc538128aaa58576da","amp;dn":"Elliott+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"976294bfadcf1ca0b36aa0bc538128aaa58576da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,98,148,191,173,207,28,160,179,106,160,188,83,129,40,170,165,133,118,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
