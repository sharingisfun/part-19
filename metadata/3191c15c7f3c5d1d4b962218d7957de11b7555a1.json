Although there is some exhibition playing by the great TatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ines, most of the material here is rumba with a bit of santeria thrown in the mix. There are quite a few numbers by Los Papines, including some vintage footage, from the '50s or early '60s. Some of this Papines material -- as well as some of the TatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ines footage, appears on another DVD entitled &quot;Rumberos,&quot; but this is of superior quality. This one also includes material not on &quot;Rumberos,&quot; specifically the tracks by Conjunto Folklorico Nacional and Yoruba Andabo. But the most amazing footage here is of Los Ibellis Junior, a folklore group consisting of kids, perhaps from ages 9 though 17, the lead singer and quinto player being the youngest of the band. He also plays Iya, the large batÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ drum. This folks, is outstanding stuff that I have not come across before. It is a must-have for collectors of the genre. For Los Ibellis Junior alone, this one is... Highly Recommended. (review by Descarga)\n\n1. Historia Tata Guines\n2. Tata Guines\n3. Historia Los Papines\n4. La Chambelona - Los Papines\n5.
