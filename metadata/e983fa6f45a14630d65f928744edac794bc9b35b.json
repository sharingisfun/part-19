Unlike the aforementioned bands, the Los Angeles-based RATM was overtly political--especially in singer Zack De La Rocha's irate lyrics and vocal delivery. When De La Rocha split at the turn of the century, the rest of the band formed Audioslave with erstwhile Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell.\n\n\nI have uploaded this with the renewed interest in the band in the U.K\n\n\n***PLEASE SUPPORT OUR CAUSE IF YOU LIVE IN THE U.K BY DOWNLOADING &quot;KILLING IN THE \n\nNAME&quot; (FROM ANY ONLINE MUSIC STORE) THIS WEEK (UNTIL SUNDAY 20TH DEC '09) AND \n\nMAKING IT CHRISTMAS NO.1 TO FUCK OFF &quot;THE X-FACTOR&quot;!!***\n\n\n-Rage Against the Machine (1992)\n\n-Evil Empire (1996)\n\n-Battle of Los Angeles (1999)\n\n-Renegades (2000)\n\n-Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium (2003)\n\n\nPlease feel free to leave comment.\n\nPlease seed for others to enjoy.
