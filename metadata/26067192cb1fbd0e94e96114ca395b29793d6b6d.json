Bowditch recently supported Leonard Cohen on his 2010 Australian tour.\n\nShe is best known as a heart-felt songwriter, for her satirical on-stage antics, and for the Open Letters section on her website in which she chronicled her early career as it happened. Most recently, she has been approached to take on several roles as a &quot;social commentator&quot;: she wrote an article for ABC's The Drum entitled &quot;Mr Jones and Me&quot;, and also made her debut on the ABC's Q&amp;A as the first panelist to also perform a song (&quot;Bigger Than the Money&quot;).
