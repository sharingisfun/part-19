The Dixie Chicks are represented twice, once on a Supremes remake, and while we'll stipulate they're every bit as machine-made as the Spice Girls, they also have sass and can really sing. Requisite and welcome classics include U2's &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; and Hall and Oates's Motown-esque &quot;Maneater.&quot; Martina McBride's &quot;I Love You&quot; is country meets '80s New Wave, proving once again that Carlene Carter was 20 years ahead of her time. There's also a requisite big production R&amp;B ballad (Allures's &quot;You're the Only One For Me&quot;), the requisite stunningly trite Diane Warren song (here done by Eric Clapton, who should have know better), and (perhaps by way of apology) a vintage Miles Davis track (&quot;It Never Entered My Mind.&quot;) But the big surprise is from, of all people, Billy Joel, who does an absolutely knockout job with Lloyd Price's funny, heretofore obscure '50s stomper &quot;Where Were You on Our Wedding Day?&quot;.\n\n&quot;I Love You&quot; was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. &quot;Ready To Run&quot; was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Country Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal and for Best Country Song.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4810234dba14698c84d9d33884d5de6e8f14b192","amp;dn":"Runaway+Bride+OST+%5Bmp3%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5BLoC.+Blazer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4810234dba14698c84d9d33884d5de6e8f14b192","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,16,35,77,186,20,105,140,132,217,211,56,132,213,222,110,143,20,177,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
