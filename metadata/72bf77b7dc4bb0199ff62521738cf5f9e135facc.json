Line drawings from a late nineteenth-century Bible illustrate many of the most famous scenes in scripture, suggesting another aesthetic layer of the text. \n\nBy breaking the Bible into constituent parts, Mazor traces the range of its writing styles, reconfiguring the work as a literary collage and an artistic masterpiece. He shows how the aesthetics of the texts that comprise the Bible serve its over-arching message, and he develops a literary portrait of its authors by decoding their cryptic aesthetic devices.\n\nGenre: Religion, Faith","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72bf77b7dc4bb0199ff62521738cf5f9e135facc","amp;dn":"Who+Wrought+the+Bible%3F+Unveiling+the+Bible%27s+Aesthetic+Secrets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72bf77b7dc4bb0199ff62521738cf5f9e135facc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,191,119,183,220,75,176,25,159,246,37,33,115,140,245,249,225,53,250,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
