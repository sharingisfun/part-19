The story is of two young women and their mother who are banished from their idyllic, isolated village by an uncle who is shamed by his brotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s adulterous behavior. In the city, they are dispersed to various houses as servants, and one of the sisters is seduced by her bachelor employer. Fleeing to the &quot;safe haven&quot; offered by their uncle, they instead witness him murder the girl. Anma, left alone with her mother, blames her for trusting the uncle, and flees back to the city on her own. There, she vows revenge on the bachelor and maneuvers to work in his house. Unable to follow through with her plan to poison him, she instead seeks to torture him by making him fall in love with her, managing at the same time to instill in him a new compassion for others. This particular course of events is handled at length and with great subtlety and respect for the charactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ intelligence. Even as their love for one another becomes clear, Anma cannot forget the injustice done her sister and her masterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s part in it. \n\nFile Name .........................................: Doa al karawan.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,767,780,352 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:58:28\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 672x504 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1532 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.181 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0231477/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0231477/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nArabic audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subpack\n\nMy rip\n\nHenry Barakat - Doa al karawan AKA The Nightingale's Prayer (1959)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4cd7ea0333e4f7a5508e499a043aa1139170a36","amp;dn":"Henry+Barakat+-+Doa+al+karawan+AKA+The+Nightingale%5C%27s+Prayer+%2819","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4cd7ea0333e4f7a5508e499a043aa1139170a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,205,126,160,51,62,79,122,85,8,228,153,160,67,170,17,57,23,10,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
