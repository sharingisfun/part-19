Thompson introduced the world to &quot;gonzo journalism&quot; with this cult classic, which shot back up the best-sellers list after Thompson&amp;#039;s suicide in 2005. No book ever written has more perfectly captured the spirit of the 1960&amp;#039;s counterculture.\n\nIn Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, Raoul Duke (Thompson) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (inspired by a real-life friend of Thompson) are quickly diverted to search for the American Dream. Their quest is fueled by nearly every drug imaginable and quickly becomes a surreal experience that blurs the line between reality and fantasy. Of course there is more to this hilarious tale than reckless behavior - for underneath the hallucinogenic facade is a stinging criticism of American greed and consumerism.\n\n&quot;A scorching epochal sensation!&quot; -Tom Wolfe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:990d05ecd8988dc16da88258e9422ed2dab88b32","amp;dn":"%5Banti-hero%5D+Hunter+S.+Thompson+-+Fear+and+Loathing+-+64kbs+-+Aud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"990d05ecd8988dc16da88258e9422ed2dab88b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,13,5,236,216,152,141,193,109,168,130,88,233,66,46,210,218,184,139,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
