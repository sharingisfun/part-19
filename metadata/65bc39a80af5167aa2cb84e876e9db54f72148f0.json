After him the guitar can be played as a hammer with percussive techniques never seen before.\n\nHe wrote nearly exclusively in alternate tunings. Some of the techniques he used include slap harmonics (created by slapping the strings over a harmonic node), use of right hand hammer-ons (particularly on bass notes), use of the left hand for melodic or rhythmic hammer-ons and pull offs, percussive slapping on the guitar body, as well as unusual strummings. He also made extensive use of string dampening as employed in classical guitar, and was known to insist strongly on the precise duration of sounds and silences in his pieces.\n\nProbably it's unuseful to make a torrent about him, but this is my personal tribute to his memory. What follows it's a collection of his albums. Also included is an amateur video where an unknown fellow shows the astonishing techniques that Hedges used in his tunes.\nAnd, if you have time, take a look onwhere you can find videos of his performance: A bliss for the heart and the eyes...\n\n______________________\n\nMichael Hedges - Torched\nMichael Hedges - Watching My Life Go By\n1981 - Michael Hedges - Breakfast in the Field\n1984 - Michael Hedges - Aerial Boundaries\n1990 - Michael Hedges - Taproot\n1996 - Michael Hedges - Oracle\nMichael Hedges - Live On The Double Planet\nMichael Hedges - Road To Return\nMichael Hedges - Strings of Steel\n(amateur video) Michael Hedges - Guitar Technique Excerpts\n(amateur video) Michael Hedges - live at Sommerville\n\t\t\n\n*****************************\n\nFRANCO MORONE\n\nFranco Morone is a gifted guitar player and composer and highly-regarded guitar teacher. His musical background is diverse, including everything from Deep Purple concerts in his Italian youth, to American blues giants like Blind Blake, to the inspirational guitar work of Leo Kottke. His own music is similarly versatile, covering everything from blues and jazz to Celtic, traditional Italian, Californian New Age, and more. \n\nHe is one of those true musicians who can say whatever he wants to say with his guitar, which makes his live performances even better than his fine recordings. If he's playing anywhere near you, you really owe it to yourself to hear his graceful, passionate, and remarkably enjoyable music live.\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.francomorone.it/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.francomorone.it/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhat follows is a collection of his albums...

His music ranges from blues to balcaninc and sefardic echoes with a strong use of weird odd tempos.\n\nIf you dont understand from these poor words the richness of his music, listen for instance &quot;Bach'n'Alya&quot; from the album &quot;Guitar Bazaar&quot;. Is it too weird for your ears? But this is pure fingerstyle, listen...\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_sparks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_sparks&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.timsparks.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.timsparks.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhat follows is a collection of his albums...
