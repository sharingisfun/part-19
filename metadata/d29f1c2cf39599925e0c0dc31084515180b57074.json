Poor sound reproduction on previous CD releases just did not allow the power of this incredible performance to shine through. All that has now changed with this RCA Living Stereo Hybrid SACD edition. The brillantly improved sound &amp; the enhanced spatial seperation on this version makes Cliburn's Tchaikovsky #1 a whole new listening experience. This is how this recording was meant to sound; this is the definitive edition of this monumental performance. Do not hesitate to add this release to your classical library, even if you own any previous incarnations of this record. This is one for the history books &amp; a sure must have!\n\n\nHere's an article for all you anal audiophiles to get your teeth into.\nWhat this poor chap lacked in his apraisal was, of course, being able to experience the vastly superior 3 ch sound. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.positive-feedback.com/Issue15/livingstereo.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.positive-feedback.com/Issue15/livingstereo.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTwo complete Living Stereo LPs on a single disc!
