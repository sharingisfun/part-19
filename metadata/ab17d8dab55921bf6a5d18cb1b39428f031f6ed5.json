Formed in 1979, The Beat were an American rock and power pop band from Los Angeles, California.\r\n\r\nThe British ska group of the same name were first to establish themselves as &quot;The Beat&quot; in Europe, prompting a voluntary decision for the U.S. group to be billed as &quot;Paul Collins' Beat&quot; in Europe. In the U.S., Collins' &quot;The Beat&quot; was first to release an album in turn forcing the British group to use the name &quot;The English Beat&quot; in the U.S., albeit only after the British group was threatened with a lawsuit by Columbia, Collins' record label.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is the first album by the band from L.A.
