All of these files can be\nfound and downloaded from the MIT OCW Site: http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm\n\n\nI did not have anything to do with this course, the recording or publishing of it or its materials. I have only\ntaken what MIT OCW was kind enough to give to the world and have compiled it into one large file. Hopefully making it available for those who can\\'t stream the videos from their site.\n\nPlease remember to go to the website: http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm and donate if at all possible to keep this\nwonderful initiative going.\n\nThe videos are .mp4 and ranging in quality as they are downloaded from the MIT OCW site.\nIf this is fairly popular I will be doing more, so if you go to the website and see any courses you would like done in this style feel free to hit me up.\n\n6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming\nAs taught in: Fall 2008\n\nLevel: Undergraduate\n\nInstructors:\n\nProf. Eric Grimson\n\nProf. John Guttag\n\n\nCourse Description:\n\nThis subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience.\nIt aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.\nIt also aims to help students, regardless of their major, to feel justifiably confident\nof their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.\nThe class will use the PythonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ programming language.\n\n**Warning: On the Python homepage, the latest version available for download is actually 3.0. Do not install this!\nThis version is not backwards compatible with the code that you\\'ll be writing in this course\n(for example, you have to type print(\\&quot;test\\&quot;) instead of print test.)**\n\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare (OCW)\n\nUnlocking Knowledge,Empowering Minds.\nFree lecture notes, exams, and videos from MIT. No registration required.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) is a web-based publication of virtually all MIT course content.\nOCW is open and available to the world and is a permanent MIT activity.\n\n\nWhat is MIT OpenCourseWare?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare is a free publication of MIT course materials that reflects almost all the\nundergraduate and graduate subjects taught at MIT.\n\n* OCW is not an MIT education.\n* OCW does not grant degrees or certificates.\n* OCW does not provide access to MIT faculty.\n* Materials may not reflect entire content of the course.\n\nWhat it takes to support this work:\n\nEach course we publish requires an investment of $10,000 to $15,000 to compile course materials from faculty,\nensure proper licensing for open sharing, and format materials for global distribution.\nCourses with video content cost about twice as much, but your feedback about the significant value of these\nvideo materials helps to justify the cost.
