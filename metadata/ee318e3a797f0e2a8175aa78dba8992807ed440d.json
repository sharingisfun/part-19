Although not a catalogue raisonnÃƒÂ©, this book does reveal the vast range and depth of material that the Museum has acquired, most of it in the design and architecture collection of the Department of Twentieth Century Art but a great deal of it also drawn from other parts of the MuseumÃ¢â‚¬â€the American Wing, The Costume Institute, the Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, and the Department of Prints and Photographs. It is divided into sections and chronologically organized. Each section begins with an introductory essay for that time period, followed by numerous color reproductions of both overall views and details of these works of art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee318e3a797f0e2a8175aa78dba8992807ed440d","amp;dn":"Modern+Design+in+the+Metropolitan+Museum+of+Art+1890-1990+%28Art+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee318e3a797f0e2a8175aa78dba8992807ed440d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,49,142,58,121,127,14,42,129,117,170,120,219,168,153,40,7,237,68,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
