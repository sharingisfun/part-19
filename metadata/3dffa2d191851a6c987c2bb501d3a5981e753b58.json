Time to Move On\n\n\n\nWelcome to Earth skilfully fuses melodic synthpop, elements of trance music, and industrial beats delivering a blend of upbeat dancefloor tracks and a couple of romantic ballads sure to please a wide range of audience. Starsign, Eclipse, and Kathy&amp;#039;s Song are certain to invade underground goth clubs, while APB&amp;#039;s cover of Metallica&amp;#039;s Fade to Black is nothing short of making mummies dance! As usual, eloquently sampled excerpts of familiar tunes catch our attention: Twin Peaks, U2, Blair Witch Project.\nTrack 12, LNDP3, assumed to be Love Never Dies Part 3, features female vocals and adds a new dimension to this album... a song that compares to Alison Limerick and Deidre Rutkowski&amp;#039;s work on This Mortal Coil&amp;#039;s Blood.\nIn a few words, Stephan has put together on this album some of the finest future-pop tunes of the past decade, making Apoptygma the Depeche Mode of the new millenium.\n\n(Review by DJ Avalanche, Musicfolio)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dffa2d191851a6c987c2bb501d3a5981e753b58","amp;dn":"Apoptygma+Berzerk+-+Welcome+To+Earth%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dffa2d191851a6c987c2bb501d3a5981e753b58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,255,162,209,145,133,26,108,152,124,43,181,1,211,165,152,30,117,59,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
