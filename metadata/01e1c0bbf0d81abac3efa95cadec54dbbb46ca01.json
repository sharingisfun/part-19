A street urchin named Tetsuro Hoshino desperately wants an indestructible machine body, giving him the ability to live forever and have the freedom that the poor humans on Earth don&amp;#039;t have. While machine bodies are impossibly expensive, they are supposedly given away for free on the planet Andromeda, the end of the line for the space train Galaxy Express 999 (Technology has advanced to the point where space-faring vehicles can assume any shape, such as the classical locomotive in the story.).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01e1c0bbf0d81abac3efa95cadec54dbbb46ca01","amp;dn":"Galaxy+Express+999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01e1c0bbf0d81abac3efa95cadec54dbbb46ca01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,225,192,187,240,216,26,186,195,239,169,92,173,236,84,219,187,70,202,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
