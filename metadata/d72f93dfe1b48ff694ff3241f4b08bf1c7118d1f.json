I \n\ndownloaded the audio file, edited it with audio-editing software, and following along \n\nwith the book, I broke apart the audio file to correlate to the chapters of the book.  In \n\naddition, each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the book's album cover, the proper \n\ntrack number (in relation to all the tracks), and proper title and chapter information.  \n\nThis makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, \n\ngo back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go \n\nthrough the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the \n\nworld.  I also included the eBook to follow along with as well as a copy of the criminal \n\nscript questions.\n\nI highly suggest listening to Marc's radio show at &lt;a href=&quot; http://marcstevens.net/radioarchive&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://marcstevens.net/radioarchive&lt;/a&gt;   \n\n \n\nEnjoy!\n\n=========================================================================================\n\nThe book that started it all and helped launch The No State Project radio show.  If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nve ever felt there was something wrong with the world but you just couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put your \n\nfinger on it, then Adventures in Legal Land is the book for you.  Perhaps the most \n\ncontroversial, informative and entertaining book to see print in years, you need to read \n\nMarc StevensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Adventures In Legal Land.\n\nThis unique book, while unreserved and outrageous, is also very amusing.  Full of \n\ncontroversy, it will not only enlighten, but may jar you awake forever changing the way \n\nyou look at the world, especially Ã¢â‚¬Å“lawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and politics. Adventures has been called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Better \n\nthan a law school education in 250 pages.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Read first hand accounts proving the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \n\nbiggest hoax.\n\n=========================================================================================\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n      Acknowledgements\n      Foreword\n      Preface\n      Introduction \n   I: Know who you're dealing with\n  II: Never assume anything\n III: Never disagree with them\n  IV: Never give them something to deny\n   V: Take away the &quot;judge's&quot; discretion\n  VI: Never argue the &quot;merits&quot;\n VII: About the so-called &quot;judge&quot;\nVIII: What role does the &quot;judge&quot; really play?\n  IX: What role does the pretended cop play?\n   X: How I cross-examine a bureaucrat\n  XI: Conclusion \n XII: Final thoughts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d72f93dfe1b48ff694ff3241f4b08bf1c7118d1f","amp;dn":"Adventures+in+Legal+Land+-+Marc+Stevens+%28organized+audiobook+%2B+e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d72f93dfe1b48ff694ff3241f4b08bf1c7118d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,47,147,223,225,180,143,246,148,255,50,65,244,176,139,241,199,17,141,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
