I have divided it up into 6 separate torrents because it was about 18 Gigs as one torrent. I have listed the titles here, but since I have already spent a lot of time on this, I have not provided a description. You can look each of them up to get more info if you wish.\n\nThis is torrent 5 of 6 containing:\n\nMen in Green Faces A Novel of U.S. Navy SEALs (Audiobook) By Gene Wentz, B. Abell Jurus\nSacrifice on the Steppe (Stalingrad- Italian)\nSavage War of Peace--Algeria\nTears in the Darkness\nThe Amber Room\nThe Long Walk - The True Story of a Trek\n\n\nHope this is satisfactory--let me know if it's not.\nI will seed for as long as possible, but give me some help.
