Alternative historian and author, Michael Tsarion is an expert on the occult history of Ireland and America. Born in Ireland, he has researched mythologies of the world, as well as his own country's magnificent and mysterious Druidic history. MichaelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work considers the consequences to civilization of extra-terrestrial involvement and answers many of the quandaries that have puzzled other &quot;visitation&quot; experts. It clarifies the disinformation about Atlantis and the lost continents of pre-history and it shows that the orchestrated chaos of today's world has roots in ancient times. Looking ahead, Michael offers profound solutions for the future.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://truthfrequencyradio.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://truthfrequencyradio.com/&lt;/a&gt;\ntruthfrequency_12_11_10_Michael_Tsarion_64k.mp3\n01h:36m:20.95s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c25fa17fc9689fa4d2fb19db3a6e3bfa8d2bfd93","amp;dn":"Michael+Tsarion+-+Mind+Control+and+the+Metachild","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c25fa17fc9689fa4d2fb19db3a6e3bfa8d2bfd93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,95,161,127,201,104,159,164,210,251,25,219,58,110,59,250,141,43,253,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
