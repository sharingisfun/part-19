I particularly like the order in which the author has presented the material. The author has provided an exceptional overview of the profession of a paralegal; the ethics, the responsibilities and regulation of the profession. This is well done.\n\nThe information Statsky compiles in this text creates a thorough foundation for the introductory paralegal student. It is a wonderful reference for students throughout the entire paralegal program, and a text the students will want to refer to when they transition from students to working paralegals\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 928 pages\n    * Publisher: Delmar Cengage Learning; 7 edition (July 29, 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1435400062\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1435400061","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57c973a2f4813f0e14c9d8a1dae7a10decf7f434","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Paralegalism%2C7th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57c973a2f4813f0e14c9d8a1dae7a10decf7f434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,201,115,162,244,129,63,14,20,201,216,161,218,231,161,13,236,247,244,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
