Ed will call on all of his expertise in extreme terrains and climates to uncover the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  Siberia \r\nEd travels deep into the heart of Siberia to investigate the origins of a mysterious ring of shattered rock, known in local legend as the nest of a giant &quot;fire eagle&quot;. With the appearance of a crater or rocky volcano in the otherwise unbroken expanse of the Taiga forest, the site continues to baffle scientists. Ed knows that cold weather locations are outside his expertise, and so he must rely on the locals for help. Ed is led to a group of semi nomadic indigenous Evenki people, whose reindeer sleds allow him to close in on his mysterious destination despite the bitter sub-zero temperatures, snowdrifts, and arduous terrain. However, the treacherous cold continues to set Ed back and, when he discovers he has frostbite, he must consider giving up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Into-the-Unknown-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Into-the-Unknown-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/Into-the-Unknown-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Into-the-Unknown-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Into-the-Unknown-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Into-the-Unknown-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Into-the-Unknown-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Into-the-Unknown-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Into-the-Unknown-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Into-the-Unknown-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Into-the-Unknown-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Into-the-Unknown-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/Into-the-Unknown-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Into-the-Unknown-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Into-the-Unknown-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Into-the-Unknown-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3192 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 5\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.discoveryuk.com/shows/ed-stafford-into-the-unknown/episodes/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af34c45f096dba631c0545bf13b86b2116ca9aa4","amp;dn":"Ed+Stafford+Into+The+Unknown+Series+1+2of5+Siberia+720p+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af34c45f096dba631c0545bf13b86b2116ca9aa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,52,196,95,9,109,186,99,28,5,69,191,19,184,107,33,22,202,154,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
