While the 1989 VHS version contained just 18 songs, the expanded DVD set has 33 performances dating through 2000, including &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad,&quot; performed in 1995 on The Tonight Show, and an acoustic &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; from a 1998 appearance on The Charlie Rose Show. Most of the highlights are, not surprisingly, from Springsteen's electrifying concerts, including raw versions of &quot;Rosalita&quot; and &quot;Thunder Road&quot; from early in his career with the E Street Band.\nAlso not to be missed: the 1987 performance of the harrowing &quot;Tougher Than the Rest,&quot; shot with poignant close-ups of wife Patti Scialfa singing backup; the raspy, gospel- tinged &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;; and the barely contained smolder of &quot;Fire.&quot; Most fans will find themselves wishing that this was strictly a concert DVD; the MTV videos from the Born in the U.S.A. years (the John Sayles-directed trilogy &quot;Born in the U.S.A.,&quot; &quot;I'm on Fire,&quot; and &quot;Glory Days&quot;) seem too canned and glossy sandwiched in with the rougher, more exhilarating live performances.\nAnd Springsteen's tendency to get preachy in the late '90s (&quot;Murder Incorporated,&quot; &quot;Dead Man Walkin'&quot;) can grate as well. But until there's a full-length performance DVD, the Video Anthology will keep fans on their feet.\n\nBruce Springsteen Video Anthology 1978-2000 is a double DVD featuring 33 performances spanning 22 years of concerts, music videos, and television appearances by Springsteen. The two-hour collection represents a complete anthology of Bruce Springsteen videos, as well as rare or previously unreleased bonus performances. In all, 15 of the 33 clips on Bruce Springsteen Video Anthology 1978-2000 did not appear on the original 1989 home video release of the Anthology. Some highlights include:\n\n--&quot;If I Should Fall Behind,&quot; a live concert performance by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Directed by Jonathan Demme, and filmed at Madison Square Garden in 2000 (previously unreleased).\n--&quot;Highway Patrolman,&quot; directed by Sean Penn (2000). Features footage from the motion picture The Indian Runner (previously unreleased).\n--&quot;Hungry Heart,&quot; a music video/performance filmed in Germany in 1995, and previously released only in Europe.\n--Rare TV performances: &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; from Bruce Springsteen's 1995 visit to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; &quot;Born in the U.S.A.,&quot; a solo acoustic performance from Springsteen's 1998 appearance on The Charlie Rose Show; &quot;Secret Garden,&quot; an alternate version, with strings (previously unreleased).\n\nComplete track listing:\n\nDisc 1:\n\nRosalita (1978; directed by Arnold Levine), The River (1980; from &quot;No Nukes&quot; concert; directed by Danny Goldberg, Julian Schlossberg, Anthony Potenza), Thunder Road (1980; from &quot;No Nukes&quot; concert; directed by Danny Goldberg, Julian Schlossberg, Anthony Potenza); Atlantic City (1982; directed by Arnold Levine) Dancing in the Dark (1984; directed by Brian De Palma), Born in the U.S.A.
