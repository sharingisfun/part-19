An education in P2P. All credit goes to the original ripper.\n\nLong ago, two species of human beings coexisted on EarthÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½until competition drove one of them to extinction. This program, set in the southwest of France 35,000 years ago, uses re-creations of cinematic proportions to reconstruct life in the Neanderthal world at the time Cro-Magnons first entered the scene. All aspects of Neanderthal clan life are examined, including tool- and weapon-making, hunting and gathering, health and healing, childbirth, rituals, and making fire. Footage of skeletal remains and the scholarly research of eminent paleontologist Chris Stringer and Oxford UniversityÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Paul Pettitt support the documentary. A Discovery Channel Production.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078c985c8a61d6f325584af0d1768c6e5a9b16af","amp;dn":"Discovery+Channel+-+Neanderthal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078c985c8a61d6f325584af0d1768c6e5a9b16af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,140,152,92,138,97,214,243,37,88,74,240,209,118,140,110,90,155,22,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
