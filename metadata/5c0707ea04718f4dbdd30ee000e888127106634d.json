The film originally starts in teh present as a old African-American postal worker, only a few months away from retirement sees a familiar face at his Stamp window and shoots the man, killing him with a German Luger pistol.  When the police search his home, they find the head peice of a missing bridge statue from Tuscany, Italy worth over $5 Million on the Black Market.  From there, the movie begins to tell the story ... the story behind the head of this statue and the four American Buffalo Soldiers who met a strange boy, a survivor of the Massacre at Sant'Anna di Stazzema ...\n\nThis film was converted from the 720p HD BluRay Rip with Videora iPod Video Converter using a 2-Pass encode at a high bitrate to capture the best quality possible.  As you can see from the screens, all of the Italian and German dialog has hardcoded English subtitles.  Enjoy!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/masa5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Additional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!  Album Art, Release Dates, and TV Tags are already filled out for you.  However, if you wish to change them, I recommend the third-party tagging program TVTagger.\n\nAfter downloading, please leave your client open and the torrent actively seeding so others may download as well and your ratio will remain high!  Also remember not to severely limit your upload speed by over-throttling.  Be kind, rewind!  Remember to eat your green vegetables.  And ...\n\nEnjoy!!\n -- VoV and the great folks at www.Podtropolis.com where you can find all of VoV's available iPod Movies, TV Shows, Audio Books, and previous torrents!
