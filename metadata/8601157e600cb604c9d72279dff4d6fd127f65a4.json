With all the mums working, the two dads on Albert Road soon take up the strain at home: Michael Taylor puts on a pinny and cooks chicken kiev, while Phil knuckles down to the housework. As the families living on the street pull together as a community for the penultimate decade, the question to which everyone wants to know the answer is, when do they feel the golden era for the family really was\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1619 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8601157e600cb604c9d72279dff4d6fd127f65a4","amp;dn":"BBC+Turn+Back+Time+The+Family+5of5+1970s+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8601157e600cb604c9d72279dff4d6fd127f65a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,1,21,126,96,12,182,4,201,215,34,121,223,244,214,253,18,127,101,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
