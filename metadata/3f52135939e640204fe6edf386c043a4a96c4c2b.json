In 2005, they self-released a demo which caught the attention of Metal Blade.\n\nTheir debut album, One (Hellbound) was recorded and mixed at Planet-Z Studios with Zeuss (Hatebreed, The Red Chord, Shadows Fall) in June 2005 and released later that year. Following this the band set out on a tour with Himsa in late 2006.\n\nIt has also been stated that the bands name, Demiricous, has no significant meaning at all and is just a made up word.
