Her stepfather, headmaster of the Academy for descendants of the Greek gods, has enrolled her at Dynamotheos Development CampÃ¢â‚¬â€aka Goddess Boot CampÃ¢â‚¬â€with a bunch of ten-year-olds for the summer. Embarrassing as that is, hopefully itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll help her gain control over her powers in time to pass the test of the gods, continue training hard enough to qualify for the Pythian Games, and enjoy her godly boyfriend, Griffin, all while avoiding the ultimate mistake of accidentally misusing powers.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another fast-paced myth-inspired heroineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure to bring out the goddess in anyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11fc3a148622eabdef71fc07fd2cccdce747b97d","amp;dn":"Goddess+Boot+Camp+-+Tera+Lynn+Childs+.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11fc3a148622eabdef71fc07fd2cccdce747b97d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,252,58,20,134,34,234,189,239,113,252,7,253,44,204,220,231,71,185,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
