The cornerstone of the evening in Berlin will be the world premiere of this 50-minute movie that visualizes classics as &quot;The Race&quot;, as well as songs from the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to be released October 2, 2009. Touch Yello evokes moods, pictures and movie scenes. For the creation of this virtual concert they're working with Kevin Blanc, a Swiss moving image designer and art director. The premiere of Touch Yello will be accompanied by live performances by the famous German jazz musician Till BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nner and singer Heidi Happy.\n\nThis is the logical next chapter in YelloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 30-year history, which has seen the electronic innovators pushing the limits of music video production since 1981, when they released &quot;Pinball Cha ChaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a suave figure-oriented video that was later included in the Museum of Modern Art's Music Video Exhibition.\n\nHowever, the most mainstream aspect of YelloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music and film career sprung from the success of the 1985 single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOh YeahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, an addictive number which was prominently featured in John HughesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ classic Ferris BuellerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Day Off, among other films. After that, the group continuing composing for the silver screen: they scored the comedy Nuns on the Run and band member Dieter Meier directed the 1990 feature Snowball.\n\nYelloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extending dabblings in film made them natural candidates for Electronic Beats ClassicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s virtual concert dedication. This groundbreaking event will take place at 9:30 pm on October 1, 2009 in the charming and historic Kino International Berlin.\n\nYelloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next Album Touch Yello appears on October 2, 2009 on Universal Music.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:229b40d78a74d91242b94b731ffb5505bf221b7e","amp;dn":"Yello+-+Touch%2C+the+virtual+concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"229b40d78a74d91242b94b731ffb5505bf221b7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,155,64,215,138,116,217,18,66,185,75,115,31,251,85,5,191,34,27,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
