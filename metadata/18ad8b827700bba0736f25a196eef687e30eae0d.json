However this is not my torrent. To see more details about this game, pay some time to visit the site inor demonoid\nSystem requirements:\n\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or higher (actually you can play in the older Mac OS 10.5.x, but sometime it will get problems about using the mouse. If you want to play in the best conditions, use Snow Leopard!!!).\n\nIntel Cider Port Macbook (Power PC, G3, G4 or the older versions not supported!!!)\n\nIntel 2.4 GHz or AMD 2.0 GHz (will play better in Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz+).\n\nRAM: 2 GB.\n\nHard disk drive: 13 GB.\n\nGraphics Card: 128MB (play better in 256MB VGA cards).\n\nTested in : Macbook Pro 13''\nMac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.3\nIntel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz\n2 GB RAM\nNVidia GeForce 9400M 256 MB\nPlay well at the resolution 1024x768 (you can set the resolution higher if you want, but this is the optimal settings to prevent some lag on the screen).\n\nYou can customize the character if you want, the interactions of your character is very real!!! The story is interesting and combat mode is well!! The main story line is excellent, however, the side quest is acceptable (if you want to ask me!). Enjoy this game, and feel free to give me some feedback!!!\n\nInstall the game: Simply unzip and play!!!\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\nDon't know how long this torrent will exist, but I feel good to share this for everyone, I will seed whenever I can!!!
