They attempted an electronically-tinged reggae and soul-influenced pop music, constrained by the technology they had access to at the time. They released a number of records from 1982 until 1987. The band was formed by brothers Martyn and Steve Young, with guest singers until Lorita Grahame joined as a permanent member in 1983.\n\nThe band finally had an international hit in 1987 with &quot;Pump Up The Volume&quot; (see 1987 in music), a collaboration with A R Kane under the name M/A/R/R/S. The song was notable for being constructed almost entirely from samples of other records, a novel thing for a popular record at that time. The pressures of sudden success and the long running litigation caused by the use of samples ended up causing the band never to record again.\n\nGreat music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:431fe255115d8ab172f6a46175924f1bec675bfb","amp;dn":"Colourbox+-+1983+-+Colourbox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"431fe255115d8ab172f6a46175924f1bec675bfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,31,226,85,17,93,138,177,114,246,164,97,117,146,79,27,236,103,91,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
