(1988)\n\n\nmp3@192 kbps cbr \n\n\n\nThis was Bootsy's big comeback album after several years of laying low, mostly doing production &amp; session work. The late 80's were the beginning of the funk comeback, with this album and Clinton's The Cinderella Theory being the works that kicked it off. Both albums also saw their artists return to touring, with Bootsy playing with most of the regular Rubber Band members, playing a mix of new and old material.\n\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01 - Party On Plastic (What's Bootsy Doin'?) {W Collins, Vicki Vee} 3:57\n02 - Subliminal Seduction (Funk-Me Dirty) {Wes Boatman, G Clinton, W Collins} 3:31\n03 - Leakin' {Trey Stone, G Clinton, W Collins} 4:16\n04 - Shock-It-To-Me {W Collins, Bill Laswell} 4:57\n05 - 1st One 2 The Egg Wins (The Human Race) {W Boatman, W Collins} 4:21\n06 - Love Song {T Stone, Joe Harris, G Clinton, W Collins} 3:33\n07 - (I Wannabee) Kissin' U {Mico Wave, Gary Cooper, W Collins} 4:18\n08 - *-ing The Love Gun {G Cooper, W Boatman, W Collins} 3:45\n09 - Yo-Moma-Loves-Ya {Mama Collins, W Collins} 5:22\n10 - Save What's Mine For Me {W Collins} 4:17\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nProducer, Arranger: Bill Laswell, Bootsy Collins\n\nAxe Molesters &amp; Guitar Slayers: Ron &quot;Attitude&quot; Jennings, Catfish Collins, Stevie &quot;No Wonder&quot; Salas, Bootsy Collins\n\nComputer Smashers &amp; Keyboard Slashers: Trey &quot;Goldfish&quot; Stone, Wes Boatman, Mico Wave, Bootsy Collins\n\nUnfairlight Sample Wars: Bootsy Collins\n\nSkin Thrashers &amp; Bun Smashers, Drum Beaters &amp; Rhythm Cheaters: Bootzilla &amp; Bootsy Collins\n\nStill 'Horny Horns': Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker, Kush Griffith, Rick Gardner\n\nHorn Arrangements: Fred Wesley &amp; Bootsy Collins\n\nString Arrangements: Fred Wesley, Wes Boatman\n\nSpace Basses &amp; Low End Chasers: Bootsy Collins, Casper &amp; Bootzilla\n\nAll Drum Programming &amp; Bootsy Wave-U-Lator: Mico Wave\n\nLead Vocalization &amp; Heavy Metal Aluminum Conversation: Casper, Luv-Gun, Bootzilla, Sugar Crook, Baby Leroy\n\nFront Ground Vocal Improvisation: Gary &quot;Mudbone&quot; Cooper, Sly Fox\n\nAdditional Vocals &amp; Musicians: P-Nut Johnson, Vicky Vee, Tony Feldman\n\nExtra Rappers, Clappers, &amp; Finger Snappers: &quot;Billy J&quot; William Johnson, &quot;Oounchworm&quot; Sharir Forman, &quot;Pretty Fatt&quot;, Yolanda Frazier","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c91eb60dce2da223f36233036129675097633bb","amp;dn":"Bootsy+Collins+-+What%5C%27s+Bootsy+Doin%5C%27+%3F+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c91eb60dce2da223f36233036129675097633bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,145,235,96,220,226,218,34,63,54,35,48,54,18,150,117,9,118,51,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
