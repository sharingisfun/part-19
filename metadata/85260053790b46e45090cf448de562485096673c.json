Taking ten of the most common objections to MarxismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that it leads to political tyranny, that it reduces everything to the economic, that it is a form of historical determinism, and so onÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½he demonstrates in each case what a woeful travesty of Marx's own thought these assumptions are. In a world in which capitalism has been shaken to its roots by some major crises, Why Marx Was Right is as urgent and timely as it is brave and candid. Written with Eagleton's familiar wit, humor, and clarity, it will attract an audience far beyond the confines of academia.\n\nAbout the Author\nTerry Eagleton is currently Bailrigg Professor of English Literature at the University of Lancaster, England, and Professor of Cultural Theory at the National University of Ireland, Galway. He lives in Dublin.\n\nHardcover: 272 pages \nPublisher: Yale University Press (April 12, 2011) \nLanguage: English \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85260053790b46e45090cf448de562485096673c","amp;dn":"Why+Marx+Was+Right","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85260053790b46e45090cf448de562485096673c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,38,0,83,121,11,70,228,80,144,207,68,141,229,98,72,80,150,103,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
