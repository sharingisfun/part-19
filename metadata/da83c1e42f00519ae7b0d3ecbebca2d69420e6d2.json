With her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fortune, her husband, William, has made significant additions to the estate, but he too feels boundÃ¢â‚¬â€by the obligations of his title as well as his vows. Their son, Harry, is expected to follow in his footsteps, but the boy has dreams of his own, like pursuing the new adventure of aerial flight. \n\nMeanwhile, below stairs, a housemaid named Emily holds a secret that could undo the Cavendish name.\nOn Christmas Eve 1913, Octavia catches a glimpse of her husband in an intimate moment with his beautiful and scandalous distant cousin.
