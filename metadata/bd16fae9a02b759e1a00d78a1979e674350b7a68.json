The album reached #13 in the UK record charts and included the hit singles &quot;Perfect Skin&quot; (#26 in UK), &quot;Forest Fire&quot; (#41 in UK) and &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot; (#65 in UK, #31 in the Netherlands).\nThe bulk of the album was written by frontman Lloyd Cole, who formed the band while a student at the University of Glasgow. Cole cites Bob Dylan and Booker T. &amp; the MGs as major influences, but also notes the impact of his studies in English and philosophy on both the album's title, a reference to the novel Play It As It Lays by Joan Didion, and its lyrics, which also reference Renata Adler, Simone de Beauvoir and Norman Mailer\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\nDisc 1:\n01.
