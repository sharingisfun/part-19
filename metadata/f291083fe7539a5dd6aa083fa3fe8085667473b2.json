We have Dead Son Rising to finish, Splinter to get written and recorded, and both albums will be released in 2010, one in Spring, one in late summer is the current plan. Even with all the studio work 2010 will be spent mainly on the road promoting those two new albums, in the UK and elsewhere. The final two days filming of the promo video for The Fall will be done before Christmas although we have yet to decide on a release date for the single. Lot's more going on which I will tell you about as soon as I can remember. Thanks again for coming along to the tour. I genuinely loved it. &quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.numan.co.uk/box/news.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.numan.co.uk/box/news.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlso have a listen to this amazing collaboration with Little Boots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/events/hub/artists/nuboots.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/events/hub/artists/nuboots.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n_____________\n\nGary Numan - Hope Bleeds (2003) live, DVD rip (avi)\n\n\ndescription from stalkeruk:\n\nThis DVD features Gary Numan's sold out live performance at the Manchester Academy, on the 20th September 2003.\n\nTracklist:\n\nHybrid\nPure\nFilms\nRIP\nMetal\nThe Aircrash Bureau\nDark\nCrazier\nJagged\nMy Jesus\nDown In The park\nComplex\nBleed\nI Can't Breathe\nA Prayer For The Unborn\nMy Breathing\nAncients\nAbsolution\nMy Shadow In Vain\nAre 'Friends' Electric?\n\nIf you enjoy this please go to Garys website and purchase the dvd. http://www.numan.co.uk/\n\n______________\n\n\nthis is quite large so might take a while!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f291083fe7539a5dd6aa083fa3fe8085667473b2","amp;dn":"Gary+Numan+-+Hope+Bleeds+%28live+2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f291083fe7539a5dd6aa083fa3fe8085667473b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,145,8,63,231,83,154,93,214,170,8,63,163,254,128,133,102,116,115,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
