This reconceptualization is based on the exclusion of and dichotomous opposition to notions of the real, the one (unity and continuity), and the stable. The non-philosophical reading of postructuralist philosophy engenders new forms of universalisms for global debate and action, expressed in a language the world can understand. It also liberates theory from ideological paralysis, recasting the real as an immediately experienced human condition determined by gender, race, and social and economic circumstance.&quot;\n\nReviews:\n&quot;Cut of the Real is an important and original contribution to the complex discussions relating to subjectivity and identity. Through her nuanced reading of Lacan and Laruelle, Katerina Kolozova creates a powerful argument for a notion of democratic love that allows us to break through some of the ambiguities that have attended discussions of subjectivity, human nature, and the possibility of meaningful or radical social change. Her book will be a must-read in fields as diverse as philosophy, anthropology, and law.&quot; -Drucilla Cornell, Rutgers University\n\n&quot;Kolozova's important new book is a fascinating disruption of the assumptions of post-structuralist feminism. Her creative extension of the 'non-philosophy' of Laruelle radicalizes feminist philosophy as it expands possibilities for theorizing the real as experienced. This is a major contribution to the new materialism.&quot; -Jodi Dean, Hobart and William Smith Colleges\n\n\nThis torrent contains the original retail EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, LIT, and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
