Suzuki, K. Watanabe (Springer, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nIt was with great pleasure that I accepted the invitation to write the foreword for Drugs and Poisons in Humans. A Handbook of Practical Analysis. Dr. Osamu Suzuki and Dr. Mikio Yashiki, two outstanding Japanese scientists, f rst published the Handbook in Japanese in 2002. Specialists throughout Japan contributed analytical methods for a wide variety of therapeutic and illicit drugs, pesticides, and natural toxins and alkaloids. In fact, rarely has such a wide spectrum of analytes and metabolites been addressed within a single reference manual. At the beginning of the book, general topics are addressed, including instructions on h- dling biological materials, measurement of drugs in alternative specimens, and guidance on resolving analytical problems that may occur. T ere are discussions of extraction modalities and detection methodologies and how to select these appropriately based on the physioche- cal characteristics of the drug. Analysis of specif c classes of drugs and relevant metabolites are covered in subsequent chapters. Clinical, analytical and forensic toxicology and clinical ch- istry laboratories will f nd the volume informative and useful. Toxicologists are of en faced with developing methods for new drugs and metabolites with little information available in the literature. T is book provides a great starting point for method development providing pro- dures that have been utilized in real life situations. In addition, toxicologists developing new methodologies may use this volume as a guide to selecting the most appropriate instrumen- tion to handle the breadth of their analytical workload","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:675c8b164081cf24e692b77407392bec03ec343b","amp;dn":"Drugs+and+Poisons+in+Humans+-+A+Handbook+of+Practical+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"675c8b164081cf24e692b77407392bec03ec343b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,92,139,22,64,129,207,36,230,146,183,116,7,57,43,236,3,236,52,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
