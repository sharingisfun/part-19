TOKLAS - 1968\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.2\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063115/\n\n  Harold Fine is a Jewish professional who's being pressed by his fiance (Joyce Van Patten) to nail down a wedding date. Harold's bored and dissatisfied with his life, though; when he meets Nancy (Leigh Taylor-Young), a hippie-chick friend of his brother's, he decides to tune in, turn on, and drop out, in a big way. He flees the altar, leaving Joyce standing alone, and pursues the counterculture life. Soon, though, Harold discovers that the hippie life isn't all it's cracked up to be, with its hipper-than-thou hypocrisy adding up to little more than a different brand of conformity.\n\n  Starring: Peter Sellers, Leigh Taylor-Young, Joyce Van Patten, Jo Van Fleet, David Arkin.\n\n  Directed by: Hy Averback.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 33min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 416\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15dfe40d5d20145e881cce1e600a81a9776593e6","amp;dn":"I+Love+You+Alice+B.+Toklas+%281968%29+%28Peter+Sellers%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15dfe40d5d20145e881cce1e600a81a9776593e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,223,228,13,93,32,20,94,136,28,206,30,96,10,129,169,119,101,147,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
