The tale is quite shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½only about 4000 words long.&quot;\n\n...\n\n&quot;An animated adaptation of the story was created by FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ric Back in 1987.[5] This 30-minute short film was distributed in two versions - French and English - narrated respectively by noted actors Philippe Noiret and Christopher Plummer, and produced by Radio-Canada. It won the Academy Award for best animated short film, as well as several other awards that year.&quot;\n\n  -- Wikipedia\n\nThis is only English version with Christopher Plummer.\n\nNote: there was another torrent of this floating around but the quality was so bad that it wasn't worth watching. I'm creating this because I think that this is an important film and deserves to be seen at decent quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eecd597f88b08d4fd6baea11812989f4da4ab1ec","amp;dn":"The+Man+Who+Planted+Trees+%281987+animation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eecd597f88b08d4fd6baea11812989f4da4ab1ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,205,89,127,136,176,141,79,214,186,234,17,129,41,137,244,218,74,177,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
