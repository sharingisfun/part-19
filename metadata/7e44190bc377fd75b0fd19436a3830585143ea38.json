This volume collects twelve essays by leading Civil War scholars who demonstrate how the meanings of the Civil War have changed over time.\n\nThe essays move among a variety of cultural and political arenas--from public monuments to parades to political campaigns; from soldiers' memoirs to textbook publishing to children's literature--in order to reveal important changes in how the memory of the Civil War has been employed in American life. Setting the politics of Civil War memory within a wide social and cultural landscape, this volume recovers not only the meanings of the war in various eras, but also the specific processes by which those meanings have been created. By recounting the battles over the memory of the war during the last 140 years, the contributors offer important insights about our identities as individuals and as a nation.\n\n\n# Paperback: 296 pages\n# Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press (December 1, 2004)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0807855723\n# ISBN-13: 978-0807855720","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e44190bc377fd75b0fd19436a3830585143ea38","amp;dn":"The+Memory+of+the+Civil+War+in+American+Culture+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e44190bc377fd75b0fd19436a3830585143ea38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,68,25,11,195,119,253,117,176,253,25,67,106,56,48,88,81,67,234,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
