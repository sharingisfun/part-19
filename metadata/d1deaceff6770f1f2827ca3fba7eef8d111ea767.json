Concerned over the well-being of his young daughter, Macauley takes her out of her hostile environment and hits the road. Against the breathtaking landscapes and panoramas of the Outback, father and daughter grow to love and understand one another on a deeper and more profound level than ever before. The Shiralee was remade as an Australian TV miniseries in 1989.\r\n\r\nIn Binnaway, Australia The Shiralee is still a popular topic of conversation for many locals. Some have their own unique memories, such as Peter Finch's use of their bicycle or hat while in the town. To this day, the inclusion of Binnaway in a film made over fifty years ago is still acknowledged in the tourist literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 672x404, 25.000 fps, 1800 Kbps, 01h35m57s\r\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo\r\nRatio: 1.663\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/lmoh6me8h/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/osk264xef/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/fm6cwlhjr/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/pkrbj2qzb/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/4p517tus7/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1deaceff6770f1f2827ca3fba7eef8d111ea767","amp;dn":"The+Shiralee+%5B1957+-+United+Kingdom%5D+Aussie+Outback+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1deaceff6770f1f2827ca3fba7eef8d111ea767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,222,172,239,246,119,15,31,40,39,202,63,186,126,239,141,17,30,167,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
