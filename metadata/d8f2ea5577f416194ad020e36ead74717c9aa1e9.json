These applications, written in the Java programming language and access from your browse, are called ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£appletsÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥. Corporations also use Java applets for intranet applications and other e-business solutions. Java is used by companies in all major industries. Whether deployed on cell phones, embedded devices, game consoles, laptops, or in datacenters, Java offers the rich user interface, performance, versatility, portability, and security that todayÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s networked applications require. Java Platform Standard Edition software is the premier platform for rapidly developing and deploying secure, portable applications that run on server and desktop systems spanning most operating systems. JRE contains the Java virtual machine, runtime class libraries, and Java application launcher that are necessary to run programs written in the Java programming language.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n                               By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f2ea5577f416194ad020e36ead74717c9aa1e9","amp;dn":"Java+Runtime+Environment+8.0+Build+55%2832%2B64bit%29+Final+%5BWindows%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f2ea5577f416194ad020e36ead74717c9aa1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,242,234,85,119,244,22,25,74,208,32,227,110,173,116,113,124,154,161,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
