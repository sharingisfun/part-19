Not only does the box select highlights from classic albums like Luxury Liner, Roses in the Snow, and Blue Kentucky Girl, but it also features her early duets with Gram Parsons and selections from the Trio album she recorded with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt. Portraits doesn't dwell too long on unreleased material -- there are only five unearthed tracks on the entire set -- preferring to sketch out a full overview of her career. While there might be a few favorite tracks missing, the box nevertheless fulfills its goals quite nicely -- anyone looking for a comprehensive compilation of Emmylou's career will not be disappointed.\n-- Thom Owens, All-Music Guide\n\nIncludes the song &quot;Evangeline&quot; with the Band from The Last Waltz and Levon Helm's background vocals on &quot;Heaven Ain't Ready For You Yet&quot; from the Jesse James album.\n\nTracks\n\nBoulder to Birmingham\nBefore Believing\nLove Hurts\nIn My Hour Of Darkness\nAngels Rejoiced Last Night\nSleepless Nights\nToo Far Gone\nIf I Could Only Win Your Love\nTill I Gain Control Again\nOne Of These Days\nTogether Again\nHere, There and Everywhere\nYou're Still On My Mind\nSweet Dreams\nLuxury Liner\nMaking Believe\nPancho &amp; Lefty\nTwo More Bottles Of Wine\nYou Never Can Tell\nEasy From Now On\nIn My Dreams\nLove Is\nTo Know Him Is To Love Him\nPain Of Loving You\nFarther Along\nAngel Band\nI Still Miss Someone\nRiver For Him\nHeartbreak Hill\nIcy Blue Heart\nGulf Coast Highway\nWe Believe In Happy Endings\nWest Texas Waltz\nRollin' and Ramblin'\nCasey's Last Ride\nHello Stranger\nEverytime You Leave\nBeneath Still Waters\nBlue Kentucky Girl\nTo Daddy\nEvangeline\nSave the Last Dance For Me\nMister Sandman\nAnd I Love You So\nIf I Needed You\nRoses In the Snow\nBoxer\nWayfaring Stranger\nMillworker\nDimming Of the Day\nHeaven Ain't Ready For You Yet\nJuanita\nBorn To Run\nPrice You Pay\nSweet Chariot\nThat Lovin' You Feelin' Again\nHard Times\nCalling My Children Home\nWalls Of Time\nWhen I Paint My Masterpiece\nNo Regrets\n\nSidemen\n\n(only members of the Band listed)\nThe Band\nEmmylou Harris - Portraits - 1996 - WEA/Warner Brothers 45308\n\nAMG Rating: Best-of-Artist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee732b798ba2b32e56bb1ea76fdf6bd0879a7bb1","amp;dn":"Emmylou+Harris+Portraits+%5B3+Discs%5D+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee732b798ba2b32e56bb1ea76fdf6bd0879a7bb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,115,43,121,139,162,179,46,86,187,30,167,111,223,107,208,135,154,123,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
