AJ.\n\nThrill with lissome lust of the light,\nO man! My man!\nCome careering out of the night\nOf Pan! Io Pan!\nIo Pan! Io Pan! Come over the sea\nFrom Sicily and from Arcady!\nRoaming as Bacchus, with fauns and pards\nAnd nymphs and satyrs for thy guards,\nOn a milk-white ass, come over the sea\nTo me, to me,\nCome with Apollo in bridal dress\n(Shepherdess and pythoness)\nCome with Artemis, silken shod,\nAnd wash thy white thigh, beautiful God,\nIn the moon of the woods, on the marble mount,\nThe dimpled dawn of the amber fount!\nDip the purple of passionate prayer\nIn the crimson shrine, the scarlet snare,\nThe soul that startles in eyes of blue\nTo watch thy wantonness weeping through\nThe tangled grove, the gnarled bole\nOf the living tree that is spirit and soul\nAnd body and brain Ã¢â‚¬â€ come over the sea,\n(Io Pan! Io Pan!)\nDevil or god, to me, to me,\nMy man! my man!\nCome with trumpets sounding shrill\nOver the hill!\nCome with drums low muttering\nFrom the spring!\nCome with flute and come with pipe!\nAm I not ripe?\nI, who wait and writhe and wrestle\nWith air that hath no boughs to nestle\nMy body, weary of empty clasp,\nStrong as a lion and sharp as an asp Ã¢â‚¬â€\nCome, O come!\nI am numb\nWith the lonely lust of devildom.\nThrust the sword through the galling fetter,\nAll-devourer, all-begetter;\nGive me the sign of the Open Eye,\nAnd the token erect of thorny thigh,\nAnd the word of madness and mystery,\nO Pan! Io Pan!\nIo Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan Pan! Pan,\nI am a man:\nDo as thou wilt, as a great god can,\nO Pan! Io Pan!\nIo Pan! Io Pan Pan! I am awake\nIn the grip of the snake.\nThe eagle slashes with beak and claw;\nThe gods withdraw:\nThe great beasts come, Io Pan! I am borne\nTo death on the horn\nOf the Unicorn.\nI am Pan! Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan!\nI am thy mate, I am thy man,\nGoat of thy flock, I am gold, I am god,\nFlesh to thy bone, flower to thy rod.\nWith hoofs of steel I race on the rocks\nThrough solstice stubborn to equinox.\nAnd I rave; and I rape and I rip and I rend\nEverlasting, world without end,\nMannikin, maiden, Maenad, man,\nIn the might of Pan.\nIo Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan! Io Pan!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36eae3e2f28fb52c732940f51756475993cc8de8","amp;dn":"Aleister+Crowley+-+Hymn+to+Pan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36eae3e2f28fb52c732940f51756475993cc8de8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,234,227,226,242,143,181,44,115,41,64,245,23,86,71,89,147,204,141,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
