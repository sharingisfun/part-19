It contains more violence and more sexual content.)\n**Mature Content Advisory**\nRecommended for readers 17+ due to sexual situations and language.\n\nUntil Asher Morgan came along, nineteen-year old EmberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life had always been about death. Being around Asher, though, and being able to be near him and touch him, changed her and made her feel alive for the very first time. But now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left dealing with her seclusion again, the emptiness of not being able to be touched, and the curse of the Grim Angel.\nAs a battle breaks out between Angels and Reapers, she desperately searches for answers about who she is, where she came from, and what she needs to stop the battle. But things get complicated when Cameron returns to her life and begins messing with her thoughts and emotions.\nEmber tries to hold onto her sanity while the line between life and death begins to blur. Lives are threatened. Murder is everywhere. She needs to figure out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an illusion, and who she really has feelings for before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a4c60f197ce193afc5199ac3e1977dd3a8e5cd8","amp;dn":"Cinder_X-_Sorensen__Jessica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a4c60f197ce193afc5199ac3e1977dd3a8e5cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,76,96,241,151,206,25,58,252,81,153,172,62,25,119,221,58,142,92,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
