Coauthored by four respected experts from Johns Hopkins, Ketogenic Diets continues to be the definitive guide for parents, physicians, and dieticians wanting to implement this strict diet. Anyone who is placed on the Ketogenic Diet will be told, essentially &quot;prescribed&quot; by their doctor to get this book.\n\nThis Fifth Edition has been extensively updated to reflect current advances in understanding how the diet works, how it should be used, and the future role of the diet as a treatment. Six new chapters address how to integrate the diet into all cultures, religions, and taste preferences; new information on modified and less restrictive versions of the diet, and the Modified Atkins Diet for Epilepsy are included. The book also covers exciting new research that shows the diet may work for people with other neurological illnesses.\n\nThis best-seller also includes sample meal plans, a food database, how to calculate foods, and much more.\n\nPraise for the Fourth Edition:\n\n&quot;While this is a profoundly rigorous diet, with potentially serious side effects, Freeman, Kossoff, et al. discuss every facet of the process with clarity and professionally restrained optimism. Under proper guidance and with real dedication, this diet may be the path to recovery for children with difficult-to-control seizures.&quot;-Kirkus Reports\n\n&quot;A 'must'...Very highly recommended as a top alternative to medication for kids with epilepsy.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€The Midwest Book Review\n\n&quot;This book is easy to read... Anecdotes from families that have used the ketogenic diet are interspersed throughout the chapters and make the...text more interesting, and bring the diet to life... This book is highly recommended for pediatric consumer health libraries.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€CAPHIS Consumer Connections\n\n&quot;If we had had the information in this book fifteen months earlier, a vast majority of Charlie's $100,000 of medical, surgical, and drug treatment would not have been necessary, a vast majority of Charlie's seizures would not have occurred.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ From the Foreword by Jim Abrahams, Director, The Charlie Foundation to Help Cure Pediatric Epilepsy\n;\n\nSECTION 1: Overview of the Traditional Ketogenic Diet; 1.
