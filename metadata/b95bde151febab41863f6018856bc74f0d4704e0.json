The game was developed by Tsutomu Kouno, striving to create a game that was different than other titles being released for the PSP at the time. After demonstrating a prototype of the core gameplay to his management, Kouno was able to complete development over a course of one and a half years. In LocoRoco, the player must tilt the environment by using the shoulder buttons on the PSP in order to maneuver the LocoRoco, multi-colored jelly-like characters, through each level, being aided by other odd residents while avoiding hazards and the deadly Moja Troop, to reach an end goal.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe player starts with a single LocoRoco. When this LocoRoco eats a berry, it grows by one, up to a maximum size of twenty. The single large LocoRoco may be split into individual beings by tapping a face button or through specific points on the level, while individual LocoRoco can merge back into a single being by holding down a face button. Manipulation of the LocoRoco in this manner may be necessary to guide them to the finish; while the single large LocoRoco is easier to control, small passages can only be navigated by individual LocoRoco.[3] The player can lose LocoRoco if they are touched by harmful objects or they run into the Moja, and the player will have to restart the level if they lose all their LocoRoco. With the exception of making them jump, the player does not otherwise directly control the LocoRoco, but instead controls the planet itself, tilting the planet using the shoulder buttons. This causes the LocoRoco to roll in the direction of tilt, as well as causing certain mechanical objects such as platforms to also tilt.[4] The player can also cause the LocoRoco to jump by holding and releasing both shoulder buttons; this not only allows the LocoRoco a way to cross gaps, but to burst through walls as well as harm the Moja without taking damage.[4] As the player collects more Loco Roco in a level, the music gains more voices, each Loco Roco singing a part in the overall song.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nSimply copy the downloaded ISO file in ISO folder of Memory Card and Play..!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENJOY GAMING!\n\nCOMMENTS ARE APPRECIATED!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b95bde151febab41863f6018856bc74f0d4704e0","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+LocoRoco%7E%7E%28TIMETHIEF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b95bde151febab41863f6018856bc74f0d4704e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,91,222,21,31,235,171,65,134,63,96,24,133,107,199,79,13,71,4,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
