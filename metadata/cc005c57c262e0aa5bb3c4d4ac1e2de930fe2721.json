I've only included modern editions, not the older versions available on gutenberg and elsewhere.

Burrow (Yale, 1972) Middle English only; contains extensive notes.\n\nJohn Gardner (Univ. of Chicago, 1965, 2011) Translation only; includes lengthy intro and notes; Gardner also wrote Grendel, many novels, and several excellent books on fiction writing.\n\nW.

Tolkien (Houghton Mifflin, 1975) Translation only, together with Pearl and Sir Orfeo. Note that this is not the same book as the Middle English edition edited by Tolkien and E. V. Gordon in 1925, which I'm unable to locate.\n\n\nabout the book:\n\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight (Middle English: Sir Gawayn and ÃƒÂ¾e Grene KnyÃˆï¿½t) is a late 14th-century Middle English alliterative romance. It is one of the best known Arthurian stories, and is of a type known as the &quot;beheading game&quot;. The Green Knight is interpreted by some as a representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ. Written in bob and wheel stanzas, it draws on Welsh, Irish and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition. It is an important poem in the medieval romance genre, which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess, and it remains popular to this day in modern English renderings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc005c57c262e0aa5bb3c4d4ac1e2de930fe2721","amp;dn":"Sir+Gawain+and+the+Green+Knight+%289+versions%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc005c57c262e0aa5bb3c4d4ac1e2de930fe2721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,0,92,87,194,98,224,170,91,179,196,212,172,30,45,233,48,254,39,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
