NAA's post-war existence was equally impressive as, along with many other US aircraft manufacturers, its future was bleak, but by drawing upon its vast pool of design and engineering talent, coupled with a management that actually knew how to manage (unheard of in this modern age!), the company enjoyed success again. Its ability to diversify into other sections of not only aviation but also missile technology, nuclear reactors, rocketry and space technology is mind boggling and it has been impossible to cover every aspect to NAAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vast spread of sub-divisions and spin off companies within the confines of this publication.
