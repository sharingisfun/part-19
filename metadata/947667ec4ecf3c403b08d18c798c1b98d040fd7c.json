I'M JUST CHANGING THE NAME SO ALL SHOW TITLES ARE FORMATTED ALIKE.\n\n\n&quot;Hello again and welcome to American Top 40. I'm Casey Kasem , and this is the show that lets you know how your favorite songs are doing every week from coast to coast according to Billboard magazine's national record survey. Plenty of action on American Top 40 this week; four brand new records and a brand new number one. Let's hear 'em.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nOne song on the chart was a hit eleven years ago, then re-emerged on the chart two years ago, and in this countdown is the highest debuting song of the week.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What record holds the all-time run in the top ten? (30 weeks).\n\nPaul McCartney's present group, Wings, knocks his former Group, The Beatles, out of the #1 spot on the album chart.\n\nBut a former member of one band, George Harrison of the Beatles, knocks his former band-mate (Paul McCartney) out of the #1 spot in the top 40, the only time this ever happens in chart history.\n\nPlus Pink Floyd (Money) and Deep Purple (Smoke On The Water) make for a great countdown!\n\n40:    Time To Get Down - O' Jay's\n39:    I'll Always Love My Mama - The Intruders\n38:    No More Mr. Nice Guy - Alice Cooper        \n37:    Hocus Pocus - Focus     \n36:    Satin Sheets - Jeanne Pruett     \n35:    Let's Pretend - The Raspberries    \n34:    Give You Baby A Standing Ovation - The Dells\n33:    Wildflower - Skylark\n32:    Misdemeanor - Foster Sylvers\n31:    Monster Mash - Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett &amp; The Crypt Kickers\n30:    Give It To Me - J.
