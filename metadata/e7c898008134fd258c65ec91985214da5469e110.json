This is  why  you  see  the  original  exe  renamed  to\n&quot;TDFerrari_o.exe&quot;.  As this is not allowed and in  this  case  considerably\nslows down the game with Xlive messages  while  starting  and  playing  the\ngame, you can see why we have included a proper cracked.  SKIDROW  use  the\nloader to bypass the steam &quot;bind&quot; stub to  not  have  to  bypass  the  G4WL\nintegrity checks and hence leaving the drm intact.  Our crack is completely\nnull of these issues with SKIDROW's loader approach.  The  game  starts  up\nquite considerably faster and has no mention of  xlive  problems  with  our\ncrack being used.\nWe have also included a source code of how Skidrow's pathetic  approach  to\nthis game was implemented.\nFor those interested in viewing this its included here:\n#include &lt;windows.h&gt;\nstatic LPVOID address = 0x0DAC2EE;\nstatic STARTUPINFOA si = {0};\nstatic PROCESS_INFORMATION pi = {0};\nstatic DWORD dwOldProtect = 0;\nstatic SIZE_T numberOfBytesWritten = 0;\nstatic DWORD dwPatch1 = 0xC69259E9, dwPatch2 = 0xEC8B55FF;\nstatic DWORD dwOrig1 = 0x56525153, dwOrig2 = 0xEC8B5557;\nint __declspec( naked ) WinMainCRTStartup()\n\n/* opens TDFerrari_O.exe by memory. */\nCreateProcessA(&quot;TDFerrari_o.exe&quot;, NULL, NULL, NULL, FALSE, 0x4080414, NULL, NULL, &amp;si, &amp;pi);\nVirtualProtectEx(pi.hProcess, &amp;address, 8, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &amp;dwOldProtect);\n/* opens TDFerrari_O.exe by memory. */\nWriteProcessMemory(pi.hProcess, (LPVOID)0xDAC2EE, &amp;dwPatch1, 4, &amp;numberOfBytesWritten);\n/* Offset 0xDAC2F2 to be patched with bytes\nWriteProcessMemory(pi.hProcess, (LPVOID)0xDAC2F2, &amp;dwPatch2, 4, &amp;numberOfBytesWritten);\nVirtualProtectEx(pi.hProcess, &amp;address, 8, dwOldProtect, &amp;dwOldProtect);\n/* Process runs */\nResumeThread(pi.hThread);\n/* waits for window name &quot;Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends&quot; */\nwhile (!OpenMutexA(MUTEX_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, &quot;Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends&quot;))\nSleep(1);\n/* Suspends process */\nSuspendThread(pi.hThread);\nVirtualProtectEx(pi.hProcess, &amp;address, 8, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &amp;dwOldProtect);\n/* Offset 0xDAC2EE to be patched with bytes\nWriteProcessMemory(pi.hProcess, (LPVOID)0xDAC2EE, &amp;dwOrig1, 4, &amp;numberOfBytesWritten);\n/* Offset 0xDAC2F2 to be patched with bytes\nWriteProcessMemory(pi.hProcess, (LPVOID)0xDAC2F2, &amp;dwOrig2, 4, &amp;numberOfBytesWritten);\nVirtualProtectEx(pi.hProcess, &amp;address, 8, dwOldProtect, &amp;dwOldProtect);\n/* Process resumes */\nResumeThread(pi.hThread);\n/* Loader closes /*\nExitProcess(0);\n\nGame information:\n\nTest Drive: Ferrari is the ultimate driving  experience  for  fans  of  the\nFerrari brand.
