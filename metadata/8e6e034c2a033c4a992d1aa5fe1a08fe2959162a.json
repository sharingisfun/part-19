Did you find yourself at the final boss only to destroy them in a few turns? Were you disappointed in Emerald and Ruby weapon the two Super bosses of the game?\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Hard Type begins addressing all these things and more by giving you a more challenging experience. In this game not only will monsters pose enough of a challenge to let you enjoy the devastating power of your final limit break more often; you'll find yourself needing every last drop of power your limit gauge has to offer.\n\nThe creator of this Final Fantasy VII mod GalenMyra did the best job possible to keep the experience as close to the original as possible; by increasing the difficulty of monsters and bosses. All dialogue has been untouched. Keep in mind this is Version 7 as Final Fantasy VII is unstable to edit where one bug may be addressed another could arise so be on the lookout for newer versions. You may notice in the background image before you start the game, in the lower right hand corner I have and will continue to post what version you are playing.  \n\n::..Main Features..:\nSome of the main features of this game include\n\n::..Characters..::\n- Playable characters begin the game with lower health points.\n- The 9,999 damage limit has been lifted for all playable characters.\n- The main character &quot;Cloud&quot;Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ begins the game with more items as well as additional material - Enemy Lure &amp; Enemy Away.\n- Initial materia for playable characters have been changed to make the game more difficult.\n- The main character &quot;Cloud&quot; now requires more experience to level.\n- Using the steal command is more beneficial to the player with a higher success rate.\n\n::..Monsters..::\n- The stats such as health points and magic points have been increased to make battles more difficult.\n- Monsters are no longer able to be transformed into source-items.\n- The stats of bosses have been rebalanced and immunities have been changed.\n- Certain monster skills such as Dragon Force&quot; which were not originally obtainable now are.\n- Items can no longer be won through the CMD.\n- Emerald weapon is now immune to gravity.\n\n::..Weapons &amp; Armor..::\n- Materia combination's to make ultimate weapons over powered have been rebalanced.\n- Certain weapons and armors have been rebalanced; such as those without material slots.\n- Main character weapons now have additional material growth.\n- Ribbons which protected against &quot;all&quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ status effects now protect against all status effects, including haste and barriers.\n- Tetra elemental now does half element damage.\n\n::..Materia..::\n- Many spells have been rebalanced, and enemy obtained skills require more magic points to use.\n- The White Wind removed all status effects including those like haste and barrier.\n- Many material no require more AP to level them.\n- Health Point and Magic Points modifier materia have had their effects reduced.\n- Instant death spells are less effective and require more magic points to activate.\n- Knights of the Round although still the most powerful spell in the game although you will now pay for what you receive.\n\n\n::..The Question Remains..::\nDo you have what it takes to challenge Final Fantasy VII Hard Type and still come out on top?\n\n::..To get this game in .bin &amp; .cue file formats follow the link below..::\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5956780/Final_Fantasy_VII_HardType_v7_PSX_NTSC-U\n\n\n--Please Enjoy--\n-TwisTtheTwiTcH-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e6e034c2a033c4a992d1aa5fe1a08fe2959162a","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+VII+HardType+for+PSP+v7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e6e034c2a033c4a992d1aa5fe1a08fe2959162a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,110,3,76,42,3,60,74,153,45,26,165,254,26,8,254,41,89,22,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
