You can craft and create with your friends \n\nanywhere in the world so long as you have hands spare and battery to burn.\n\n\nOur most recent update added the iconic Creepers. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re big, green, mean and \n\nexplody. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one of many. Since Minecraft Ã¢â‚¬â€ Pocket Edition first appeared, \n\nweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re continuing to add loads of new features, including...\n\n- Food! Now you can cook and go hungry\n\n- Swords! Bows! TNT!\n\n- Chests\n\n- Skeletons\n\n- Spiders\n\n- Beds\n\n- Paintings\n\n- Lots more!\nBut enough talk! Download it already!
