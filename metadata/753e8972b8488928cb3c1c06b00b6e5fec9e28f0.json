H.264 video &amp; AAC audio (Quicktime). 105 minutes.\n\nFrom boyiam.mayfirst.org\nWhile female-to-male transgender visibility has recently exploded in this country, conversations about trans issues in the lesbian community often run into resistance from the many queer women who view transitioning as a &quot;trend&quot; or as an anti-feminist act that taps into male privilege. Boy I Am is a feature-length documentary that begins to break down that barrier and promote dialogue about trans issues through a look at the experiences of three young transitioning FTMs in New York CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Nicco, Norie and KeeganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as they go through major junctures in their transitions, as well as through the voices of lesbians, activists and theorists who raise and address the questions that many people have but few openly discuss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:753e8972b8488928cb3c1c06b00b6e5fec9e28f0","amp;dn":"Boy+I+Am+%282006+documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"753e8972b8488928cb3c1c06b00b6e5fec9e28f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,62,137,114,184,72,137,40,203,60,28,6,176,11,110,95,236,158,40,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
