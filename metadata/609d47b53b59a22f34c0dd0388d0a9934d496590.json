M65, On-Site Generation of Hypochlorite, presents the principles of on-site generation (OSG), the differences between low-strength and high-strength OSG systems, and the subsequent impact each of these systems has on design, construction, and maintenance for water and wastewater utilities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM65 provides operators and engineering staff with a basic understanding of how to design and install both low- and high-strength OSG systems, how they work, and how they compare with other popular forms of chlorine currently on the market. A cost analysis and an examination of how OSG affects disinfection by-product formation are also included. This manual should help operators, planners, management, and engineers improve their decision-making processes about OSG systems using a holistic risk management approach that considers not only triple-bottom-line approaches but also the specific regional situation when choosing a chlorination system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:609d47b53b59a22f34c0dd0388d0a9934d496590","amp;dn":"M65+-+On-Site+Generation+of+Hypochlorite","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"609d47b53b59a22f34c0dd0388d0a9934d496590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,157,71,181,59,89,162,47,52,192,221,3,136,208,169,147,77,73,101,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
