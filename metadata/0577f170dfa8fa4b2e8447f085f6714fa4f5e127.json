(don&amp;#039;t forget the periods) is not     \n          exactly the album that affirmed admirers of Panic At The Disco will have expected.   \n          The quartet, then teenagers, hit big in 2005 when A Fever You Can&amp;#039;t Sweat Out rode   \n          its hit single &quot;I Write Sins Not Tragedies&quot; and its striking video to huge sales,    \n          defining their niche bridging emo and theatrical art-rock. Three years later Panic   \n          (they&amp;#039;ve ditched the exclamation mark) return with an expansive album that           \n          shamelessly, and very skilfully, takes inspiration directly from the Beatles&amp;#039; bigger \n          budget productions and the baroque classic rock that came in their wake. They must   \n          use every instrument in the orchestral palette. But this is hardly a trip to &quot;guilty \n          pleasures&quot; territory, four minute pop tunes polished almost to sterility. Even the   \n          catchy, imposing opener &quot;We&amp;#039;re So Starving&quot;, where they protest &quot;we&amp;#039;re still the same\n          band&quot;, is playful rather than predictable. &quot;That Green Gentleman (Things Have        \n          Changed)&quot; offers so many styles it defies categorisation, the darkly comic sixties   \n          pastiche &quot;When the Day Met the Night&quot; could wear the vague &quot;sunshine pop&quot; label      \n          comfortably and the likes of &quot;Pas De Cheval&quot; and nicely wistful first single &quot;Nine in\n          the Afternoon&quot; stick in the head after a single hearing. Also the token acoustic     \n          strumalong is called &quot;Folkin&amp;#039; Around&quot;. Whether their fanbase actively craved such a  \n          diverse display of ambition is moot, but Pretty.Odd. is an impressive and deservedly \n          popular collection. For once it seems that the public agree with those critics who so\n          often describe lovingly crafted, low-selling tributes to genres past as perfect pop. \n          --Steve Jelbert                                                                      \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.We&amp;#039;re so starving           [01:21]                                        \n                 02.Nine in the afternoon       [03:12]                                        \n                 03.She&amp;#039;s a handsome woman      [03:12]                                        \n                 04.Do you know what i&amp;#039;m seeing [04:14]                                        \n                 05.That green gentleman        [03:15]                                        \n                    (things have changed)                                                      \n                 06.I have friends in holy      [01:56]                                        \n                    spaces                                                                     \n                 07.Northern downpour           [04:08]                                        \n                 08.When the day met the night  [04:54]                                        \n                 09.Pas de cheval               [02:39]                                        \n                 10.The piano knows something   [03:44]                                        \n                    I don&amp;#039;t know                                                               \n                 11.Behind the sea              [03:33]                                        \n                 12.Folkin&amp;#039; around              [01:56]                                        \n                 13.She had the world           [03:47]                                        \n                 14.Form a mountain in the      [03:02]                                        \n                    middle of the cabins                                                       \n                 15.Mad as rabbits              [03:48]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               48:41 min                                       \n                                                76,2 MB                                       ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0577f170dfa8fa4b2e8447f085f6714fa4f5e127","amp;dn":"Panic_At_The_Disco-Pretty.Odd-%28Retail%29-2008-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0577f170dfa8fa4b2e8447f085f6714fa4f5e127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,119,241,112,223,168,250,75,46,132,71,240,133,246,113,79,164,245,225,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
