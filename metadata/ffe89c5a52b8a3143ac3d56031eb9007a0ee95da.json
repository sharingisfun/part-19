Their debut only has a CBR of 192, but it's pretty rare anyway.\n\nJADIS was formed by guitarist / vocalist Gary Chandler, and drummer Stephen Christey in the late 1980s. They quickly achieved notoriety by opening for IQ, and then Marillion on the &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; tour. Steve Rothery was impressed enough to produce some demos tapes, which became very popular. As often happens during a band's beginnings, members move on before the big break happens. Nick May became the new bass player, and Martin Orford shared some of his spare time from IQ to help out on keyboards. This lineup proved even more popular, and JADIS became headliners. Nick didn't last very long, and they went to the IQ pool again to recruit John Jowitt.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    Albums\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1989 - Jadis [192]\n\n\n1992 - More Than Meets The Eye [320] \n\n\n1994 - Across The Water [320]\n\n\n1997 - Somersault [320]\n\n\n2000 - Understand [320]\n\n\n2001 - Medium Rare (Compilation album of 2 EP's and extra tracks.)
