From the heady days of reggae through lovers rock, a genre he virtually invented, his talent reached into the modern age. Born in the Fletcher's Land area of Kingston, Jamaica, on July 15, 1951, Isaacs arrived in the music business via the talent show circuit, a tried and true formula for many of the island's budding singing stars. Byron Lee was the first in the industry to spot his talent and brought him and Winston Sinclair into the studio to record the duet &quot;Another Heartbreak&quot; in 1968. Sadly, it went nowhere, and Isaacs decided to try his fortunes with a new vocal trio, the Concords. They set up home at Rupie Edwards' Success label, and over the next couple of years released a number of singles, including one with Prince Buster, but none caught the attention of the Jamaican public. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tMango\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Night Nurse\n02.Stranger In Town\n03.Objection Overuled\n04.Hot Stepper\n05.Cool Down The Pace\n06.Material Man\n07.Not The Way\n08.Sad To Know (You're Leaving)\n09.Cool Down The Dub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a742a87435c525690acad752097d6eda9b03804c","amp;dn":"Gregory+Isaacs+-+Night+Nurse+%281982%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a742a87435c525690acad752097d6eda9b03804c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,66,168,116,53,197,37,105,10,202,215,82,9,125,110,218,155,3,128,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
