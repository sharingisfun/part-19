BBC 2 takes you on a journey through the Seven Ages of Rock and explores the music that has been the soundtrack to our popular culture and defined each generation since the 1960's. From the producers of award winning series Dancing in the Street, Walk on By, Lost Highway and, most recently, Soul Deep, comes another landmark television history that will chart the story of rock music from the suburb to the stadium, from the crackly '45 to the MP3 download. Along the way, rock's greatest performers, singers, writers and producers tell us how rock emerged, grew, strengthened and gave voice to each new generation.\n\n2007 sees rock music at its healthiest state since the 1970's. Despite numerous predictions that 'rock is dead', it has survived. Fans are attending more gigs and more festivals than ever before and the guitar is definitely back as the weapon of choice. The UK alone has nurtured a rich new crop of rock bands over the last 5 years, each one building on the solid foundation and heritage of the past, creating a vibrant and promising legacy for the future.\n\nSeven Ages of Rock will, though the prism of a central wrap-around artist or group, explore a key era in rock. From the UK electric blues boom, via the psychedelic rock of the late 60's; from the 70's punk explosion and on to the rise of grunge and indie rock in the 1980's and beyond, this series tells story of each age through the music itself: breaking down key tracks, getting behind the songs and ideas and providing a social context for the progression of the music. With contributions from some of the biggest names in rock, the series will set a new standard in heritage music television.\n\nFeatures artists and bands like The Rolling Stones, The Who, Bob Dylan, The Kinks, The Yardbirds, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Police, U2, Nirvana, Oasis and R.E.M.\n\nNarrator : Julian Rhind-Tutt\nSeries Producer : William Naylor\nSeries Editor : Michael Poole\n\nA BBC/VH1 Classic co-production (2007)\n\n\n\nEpisode 5 : We are the Champions - Stadium Rock\n\nGlobal Jukebox - We Are The Champions follows the development of some the biggest names in Rock in the 70s and 80s, among them Queen, Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band, The Police and Dire Straits and shows how, through events such as Live Aid and the rise of MTV, rock achieved a global influence on culture and politics. The film concludes in the early 90s, as U2 effectively brought the era to a close by reinventing the big rock show so completely, that fifteen years later most major rock tours are still pale facsimiles of Zoo TV and Popmart.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1681 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 672x376\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.787:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 59:19.160\nNumber Of Parts: 7\nPart Size: 826 MB\nEncoded by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88bd8ac9bc99f055664a173d2f86259710aca7e1","amp;dn":"BBC.Seven.Ages.of.Rock.4of7.Never.Say.Die.Heavy.Metal.XviD.AC3..","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88bd8ac9bc99f055664a173d2f86259710aca7e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,189,138,201,188,153,240,85,102,74,23,61,47,134,37,151,16,172,167,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
