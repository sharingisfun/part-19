Wiley, 2002. 359 pages.\n\n\nThis book was posted a few days ago here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8073077/Homeschooling_for_dummies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8073077/Homeschooling_for_dummies&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBut the files are essentially unreadable. I took them and reprocessed the scans to create the present version of the book. It's a single file, clearscan pdf, with bookmarked contents. Good quality overall.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6312e658d3c26bda4d9955ce13f7c9adb9d8d8ac","amp;dn":"Homeschooling+for+Dummies+%28improved+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6312e658d3c26bda4d9955ce13f7c9adb9d8d8ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,18,230,88,211,194,107,218,77,153,85,206,19,247,201,173,185,216,216,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
