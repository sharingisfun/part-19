These recordings are very old, and so the quality leaves much to be desired. However, you can be sure the quality is the best you will find of these recordings, as this is the first time it's been uploaded lossless.\n\nThis is my first torrent, so I probably still need to learn some stuff. I do provide EAC logs and scans of the box and each CD cover, but I have a second-rate scanner and also cropped the images manually. I think I gave all the metadata needed; I downloaded the tags from online databases but also fixed them up so that they are clean-looking.\n\nThough these are old recordings, they are still very popular! Of FurtwÃƒÂ¤ngler, it has been said that &quot;he did not regard the printed notes of the score as a final statement, but rather as so many symbols of an imaginative conception, ever changing and always to be felt and realised subjectively...Not since Nikisch, of whom he was a disciple, has a greater personal interpreter of orchestral and opera music than FurtwÃƒÂ¤ngler been heard.&quot; An example of this is in Symphony 7 Movement 2, which he chooses to have played at snail-like speed, but gives unsurpassed power (IMO).\n\nI hope you enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1345f1b46a4d527470edcf7c7c6589454223e26","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+The+Symphonies+-+Wilhelm+Furtw%26auml%3Bngler+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1345f1b46a4d527470edcf7c7c6589454223e26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,52,95,27,70,164,213,39,71,14,220,247,199,198,88,148,84,34,62,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
