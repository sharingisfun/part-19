Based around the depraved and hard-living themes of vocalist Ryan Young's songs, the band existed mostly in the form of an endless string of EP and split 7&quot; releases for many years. Also focused on constant touring, Off with Their Heads maintained a revolving lineup so they could stay on the road more often. In 2007 they released All Things Move Toward Their End, a collection of highlights from the group's lengthy vinyl-only catalog. This compilation was followed in 2008 by their first proper full-length, From the Bottom, and the group self-released a video for the album's song &quot;Fuck This, I'm Out.&quot; The band followed up in 2010 with In Desolation. By the time their third album, Home, was released in 2013, the band had finally solidified a permanent lineup, with Young on guitar and vocals, Robbie Stewartwood on bass, and Justin Francis on drums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc539e76c309dbf3023d585f8950ca987e98b453","amp;dn":"Off+With+Their+Heads+-+3+Albums+%282008-2013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc539e76c309dbf3023d585f8950ca987e98b453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,83,158,118,195,9,219,243,2,61,88,95,137,80,202,152,126,152,180,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
