In just one or two steps, you can copy any DVD to DVDR/PSP/iPod/etc. DVDFab is brand new, is completely rewritten, is based on more than 6 years of DVD copy software development. It allows you to remove all DVD copy protections, like CSS, CPPM, RC, RCE, APS, UOPs, ARccOS, RipGuard, FluxDVD, CORE X2, etc. It is constantly updated to support latest DVD copy protections and has a very fast copying speed, normally it's about 10 - 20 minutes.\n\nMarch 26, 2010\nDVDFab 7.0.3.0 Updated!\n\n* New: Language files.\n* New: Main window is resizable and more readable on large screen now.\n* New: Added &quot;A/V Codec&quot; page in Settings window, which allows user to set preferred decoder and encoder.\n* Fix: Lots of small issues from V6.\n\nDVDFab &quot;DVD to DVD&quot;:\n\n* New: Added support for a new copy protection as found on &quot;New Moon&quot; (US).\n\nDVDFab &quot;Blu-ray to Blu-ray&quot;:\n\n* New: Added support for all known BD protection.\n* New: Added chapter support, which means you can copy specific range of movie now.\n* New: Added our own CUDA H.264 encoder.
