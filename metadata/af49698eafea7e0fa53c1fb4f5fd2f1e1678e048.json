Robert Mitchum plays the captain of an American destroyer, who despite having lost his family in the war endeavors to let his head rule his heart in combat. Curt Jurgens co-stars as a German U-boat commander, depicted as being as honorable and compassionate as Mitchum. The two men develop a grudging mutual respect as they pursue one another throughout the North Atlantic. Based on a novel by D. A. Rayner, The Enemy Below was the last theatrical film directed by Dick Powell, who hereafter concentrated on his extensive television work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Robert Mitchum, Curd JÃ¼rgens, David Hedison\r\nDIRECTOR......: Dick Powell\r\nWRITERS.......: Wendell Mayes (screenplay), D.A.
