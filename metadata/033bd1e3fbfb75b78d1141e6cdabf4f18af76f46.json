The only witness was PeterÃ¢â‚¬Â²s girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who was found wandering the highway, her hands bound in front of her and tape matted in her hair. The only clue was a pool of blood found by police at the back of the coupleÃ¢â‚¬Â²s Kombi.\n\nJoanneÃ¢â‚¬Â²s account of her ordeal - the apparent murder of her partner, her binding and gagging, and her miraculous escape into the bush away from her burly attacker and his dog - provoked a frenzy of media interest and a huge police operation, but as clues to the attackerÃ¢â‚¬Â²s identity were few and far between and police blunders mounted, doubts about JoanneÃ¢â‚¬Â²s story began to surface. Was this seemingly innocent English backpacker a liar, after all?\n\nThree years on, the saga continues with the trial of Bradley Murdoch, a gun-happy drifter from Western Australia, numerous conspiracy theories and, finally, the discovery of some vital genetic evidence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033bd1e3fbfb75b78d1141e6cdabf4f18af76f46","amp;dn":"And+Then+The+Darkness+-+Sue+Williams+-+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033bd1e3fbfb75b78d1141e6cdabf4f18af76f46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,59,209,227,251,251,117,183,141,17,65,230,205,171,244,241,138,247,111,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
