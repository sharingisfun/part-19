And also your Internet provider can exactly see which Web sites you visit and what kind of data you upload or download. When you use a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) or a hot spot to access the Internet wirelessly, for example at a train station, an airport, or in an Internet cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, it won&amp;#039;t be a problem for anyone to spy on you.\n\nIt just takes the corresponding software to turn you into a transparent user. All your movements on the Web can then be exactly traced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ whether you send private e-mails, carry out online purchases, or enter your personal access data. Even when you dial in to online applications, you are unprotected: Someone could &quot;stow away&quot; and use your access data unnoticed in order to manipulate and even delete important data!\nWhy surf anonymously? I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have anything to hide.\n\nAs soon as you go online, you receive a clear Internet protocol address - an IP. The IP acts like a transmitter on the Internet to fix your location and can therefore be traced back to the very door of your house. Every provider of Web pages can recognize precisely what you have done on their Web site: Which products have you viewed but not bought? Which images have you looked at? And even your provider can view a large amount of data such as the movies and songs you have uploaded and downloaded on your legal file sharing platform.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s not about whether you have something to hide or not. You have a right to privacy and do not have to justify this. Allow yourself the freedom of surfing the Web anonymously as well as of uploading and downloading data.\nHow does Steganos Internet Anonym VPN work?\n\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN) establishes a tunnel between your computer and one of the Steganos VPN servers. All your activities on the Internet are then carried out through that tunnel. The tunnel encrypts all information that runs through it by using an SSL connection which protects the information from being eavesdropped ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ even by your ISP. SSL connections are, for instance, also used for online banking activities. The tunnel leads to one of the Steganos servers which, in turn, forwards the request onto the Web. This way you can act completely anonymously on the Internet. The Web sites you visit will merely see the IP address of the Steganos servers.\n\nAll you need to do is install the Steganos Internet Anonym VPNÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ service on your machine. A setup wizard assists you in establishing the connection to the server and activating your account. Once your access has been activated, the main window displays the amount of GB you used within the current month, which gives you 100% control of the costs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1caccb36cabed8c8bfa0cd99f74fe923c9202485","amp;dn":"Steganos+Internet+Anonym+VPN+1.1.3+%2Bserial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1caccb36cabed8c8bfa0cd99f74fe923c9202485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,172,203,54,202,190,216,200,191,160,205,153,247,79,233,35,201,32,36,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
