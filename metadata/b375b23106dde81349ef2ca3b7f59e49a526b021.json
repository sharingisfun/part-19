Similarly, Harvey's clients are also primarily composed of \ncharacters taken from Hanna-Barbera cartoon series of the same era.

Peanut discovers a vase that, when rubbed, releases Shazzan, now in servitude to Peanut. Shazzan accuses Mentok of having imprisoned him in the vase centuries ago for gazing on the king's intended. Mentok was a genie called Mufti the Mizwa of Muzzy Tah in those days, one of several identities he has had over the years. Shazzan insists on Peanut representing him, and Mentok, after he is captured, manipulates Harvey into representing him. Mentok insists that Shazzan is attempting to frame him, and escapes from court to retrieve the halves of a magic disk that, when put back together and the magic word thus revealed is spoken (by Avenger), imprisons Shazzan in the vase again. \n\nNote:\n\nMentok attempts to escape from his prison by putting on Harvey's mask is based on Hannibal's escape on The Silence of the Lambs \n\n Plaintiff- Shazzan the Genie \nRepresentative- Peanut \nDefendant- Mentok the Mind Taker \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nJudge- Hiram Mightor \nDescription- Shazzan accuses Mentok of imprisoning him in a genie lamp for ogling the king's intended. \nDecision- Not shown. \nQuotes- Episode 33 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Inch High Private Eye, Shazzan, Chuck, Nancy \n \n--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n34 Incredible Hippo Richard Ferguson-Hull October 9, 2006  \n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary Atom Ant v. E.P.A.\n \nPeter Potamus consumes radioactive pellets that transform him into &quot;the creature&quot;, turning him green and tripling his waist size. Meanwhile, Atom Ant is charged with having high radiation levels in his home.\n\n Plaintiff- N/A \nRepresentative- Myron Reducto \nDefendant- Atom Ant \nRepresentative- Harvey Birdman \nJudge Mentok- the Mind-Taker \nDescription- Atom Ant is charged with having high radiation levels in his home. \nDecision- That Atom Ant is to be plugged in order to not excrete any more atomic waste, but Atom Ant is soon seen in Mentok's ant farm. \nQuotes- Episode 34 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Atom Ant, Captain Caveman, Inch High Private Eye. \n \n--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n35 Babysitter Richard Ferguson-Hull October 16, 2006 \n-------------------------------------------------------\n \nSummary N/A \n\nPeter Potamus takes over Sebben &amp; Sebben in Phil's absence. Reducto babysits Peanut on his birthday. Birdgirl/Judy is searching for her father Phil. Birdman goes to his highschool reunion. While running across an intersection after Peanut's party, Reducto is hit by a clown-car and killed. \nTrivia\n\nWhen Phil gets hit by the bus, and near the very end of the episode, the bus that hits Phil and almost hits Reducto has a billboard that says &quot;Watch the Colbert Report&quot; with a drawing of an eagle with headphones on. The eagle is the main symbol of The Colbert Report. \nWhen Phil is about to leave, he talks about starting his own law firm (&quot;or spin off, if you will&quot;), and how it will have a big S-shaped desk perfect for interviews, and that he would be far too busy to regularly appear, but that he will still be a contributor, or a senior correspondent (&quot;... in law&quot;). These are references to Stephen Colbert (the actor who voices Phil and Reducto) getting his own Daily Show spin-off, The Colbert Report. \nAt the part when Harvey says &quot;Phil's dead 10 minutes&quot; is right at the 10 minute mark on the DVD \n\n Plaintiff- N/A \nRepresentative- N/A \nDefendant- N/A \nRepresentative- N/A \nJudge- N/A \nDescription- N/A \nDecision- N/A \nQuotes- Episode 35 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Scrappy-Doo, Baba Looey. \n \n--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n36 Birdnapped Richard Ferguson-Hull October 23, 2006  \n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary N/A \n\nHarvey takes over for the recently deceased Phil, performing paper work and firings. At the same time, X the Eliminator is busy planning the perfect supper date with Harvey....who has yet to be invited. Finding out that Harvey is too busy to make time for an appointment, X the Eliminator sets out to kidnap Birdgirl to lure Harvey to his apartment. As well as, the reading of Phil Ken Sebben's will is read by none other than Bill Ken Sebben, Phil's twin, who was first referenced in &quot;Sebben and Sebben Employee Orientation&quot;. After the end credits, a junkyard worker is &quot;compacting, not cremating&quot; what one could presume to be Reducto's remains, evidenced by wreaths and attended by Inch High. \nTrivia\n\nWhen Bill first appears and everyone mistakes him for Phil (everyone shoots out a variation of &quot;Phil's back&quot;), someone shoots out &quot;Stephen's back&quot;, a reference to Phil's voice-artist, Stephen Colbert, leaving the show to work on his own show, The Colbert Report. \n\n Plaintiff- N/A \nRepresentative- N/A \nDefendant- N/A \nRepresentative- N/A \nJudge- N/A \nDescription- N/A \nDecision- N/A \nQuotes- Episode 36 Dialogue Link \nCameos- Inch High Private Eye. \n \n--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--\n\n37 Grodin Richard Ferguson-Hull October 30, 2006  \n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary Bobby v.

Finally, Phil Ken Sebben appears and laughs &quot;HA HA HA! Final episode stunt casting!&quot;, which is referring to Stephen Colbert's brief leave to work on his show, The Colbert Report, and coming back for the final episode to voice his character again. \nThis was a 30-minute episode, more than double the running time of other episodes.
