Consequently, cities have been the subject of much utopian thinking. But at the same time they are also the centers of capital accumulation and the frontline for struggles over who controls access to urban resources and who dictates the quality and organization of daily life. Is it the financiers and developers, or the people?\nRebel Cities places the city at the heart of both capital and class struggles, looking at locations ranging from Johannesburg to Mumbai, and from New York City to SÃƒÂ£o Paulo. Drawing on the Paris Commune as well as Occupy Wall Street and the London Riots, Harvey asks how cities might be reorganized in more socially just and ecologically sane waysÃ¢â‚¬â€and how they can become the focus for anti-capitalist resistance.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e86918b48c94a5dafbd2fa978a89f206ca6de59","amp;dn":"Rebel+Cities+David+Harvey%27s+last+book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e86918b48c94a5dafbd2fa978a89f206ca6de59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,134,145,139,72,201,74,93,175,189,47,169,120,168,159,32,108,166,222,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
