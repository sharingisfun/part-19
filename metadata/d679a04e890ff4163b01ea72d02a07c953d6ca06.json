The longbow was the weapon at the heart of the English military ascendancy in the century after 1340. Capable of subjecting the enemy to a hail of deadly projectiles, the longbow in the hands of massed archers made possible the extraordinary victories enjoyed by English forces over superior numbers at CrÃƒÂ©cy and Poitiers, and remained a key battlefield weapon throughout the Wars of the Roses and beyond. It also played a leading role in raiding, siege and naval warfare. Its influence and use spread to the armies of Burgundy, Scotland and other powers, and its reputation as a cost-effective and easily produced weapon led to calls for its widespread adoption among the nascent armies of the American Republic as late as the 1770s.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Longbow-Weapon-Mike-Loades/dp/1782000852&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Longbow-Weapon-Mike-Loades/dp/1782000852&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d679a04e890ff4163b01ea72d02a07c953d6ca06","amp;dn":"The+Longbow+%28Osprey+Weapon+30%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d679a04e890ff4163b01ea72d02a07c953d6ca06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,121,160,78,137,15,244,22,59,1,234,114,208,42,7,201,83,214,202,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
