Included are interviews\nwith renowned law enforcement officers like the former\nColombian minister of justice, footage from anti-crime\noperations, and testimony from convicted gangsters.\n\nThis enthralling History Channel production looks at\nboth the origins and current state of organized crime\nin Sicily, Russia, Colombia, India, and China. The\nseries of five shows is thoroughly researched and\nbeautifully put together, clearly elucidating the\ncomplex sociological roots that gave rise to today's\ncartels. Such fascinating topics as Russian prison\ntattoos and the ancient Indian Thug cult are discussed\nalong the way.\nThough the producers don't shy away from pointing out\ngovernmental missteps that have inadvertently assisted\nin the rise of organized crime, the series comes down\nfirmly on the side of law and order, and is careful to\nshow the ruthlessness and brutality of the black market.\nThe only hitches in the series come in the form of quick\nrepetitions of information\n(that once followed commercial breaks), but these are only\noccasionally noticeable.\nThough densely informative, The World History of Organized\nCrime never becomes dull or dry--indeed, once you start\nwatching it, it's almost impossible to stop.\n\nSicily\n\nRussia\n\nColombia\n\nChina\n\nIndia\n\nOriginal SOURCE: Carjacker/DVD5/DVD9 &lt; Cheers\nVideo: MP4/H264/852*480/29fps\nAudio: AAC/2ch/128Kbps\nEng Subs Included: NO\nSample Included: Yes\nFile Size: 500MB x5 (2.45GB)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21b03accf44b19892542747bd14b72452f4bd3b","amp;dn":"The.World.History.of.Organized.Crime.480p.DVDRip.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21b03accf44b19892542747bd14b72452f4bd3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,27,3,172,207,68,177,152,146,84,39,71,189,20,183,36,82,244,189,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
