Clarke presents this unusual documentary on the mathematical discovery of the Mandelbrot Set (M-Set) in the visually spectacular world of fractal geometry. This show relates the science of the M-Set to nature in a way that seems to identify the hand of God in the design of the universe itself. Dr. Mandelbrot in 1980 discovered the infinitely complex geometrical shape called the Mandelbrot Set using a very simple equation with computers and graphics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24076aa1345eefa52ee8447db793445b1bb5d357","amp;dn":"Fractals+-+The+Colors+Of+Infinity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24076aa1345eefa52ee8447db793445b1bb5d357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,7,106,161,52,94,239,165,46,232,68,125,183,147,68,91,27,181,211,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
