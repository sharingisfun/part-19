Please see below regarding updates. \n\nYou need to burn this to a DVD and boot from CD. It is already a bootable image, just burn to DVD and you're done. If you don't know how to, follow these instructions. \n\n\n1. Download imageburn. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download&lt;/a&gt;\n2. Install and open imageburn\n3. Select 'write image file to disk'.\n4. Browse for your download, select it and burn it.\n5. With DVD in drive, restart your PC. You will get the option of &quot;Press Any Key To Boot From CD&quot;. Press any key and follow the instructions.\nIf your PC doesn't give this option, you will get the option of pressing an 'F' key (possibly F2, F8 or F10 for example) to enter set up or enter BIOS. In here you will get the option of changing your boot order. Make the DVD drive the first one and it will now let you install Windows 7 Ultimate.\n\n\nIMPORTANT - When you install updates, make sure you do not install KB971033. You will see it is unticked, do not install it. I would recommend hiding it (right mouse click on the update) so you don't install it accidentally.\n\nIf you have installed update KB971033, download http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5863025/7_Loader_1.9.2_Chew_Wga_1.1_Wat_Remover_2.2.6_Watermark_0.8 Click on REMOVE WAT and you are done. It's much easier not to install the update in the first place.\n\n\nPlease note, as with all operating systems you get the option to upgrade an old one (XP for example) to Windows 7 Ultimate or to do a fresh install. The fresh install wipes your files but I would always advise taking the fresh install option. It just seems to make your system run smoother. My advice, save your important files and do a fresh install.\n\nPlease seed this for as long as possible.\n\n\nMany thanks, enjoy Windows 7 Ultimate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d85796281dfda251da8439e7eb9007c13b070b43","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Ultimate+-+32+Bit+%28Auto+Activation%29+-+Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d85796281dfda251da8439e7eb9007c13b070b43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,87,150,40,29,253,162,81,218,132,57,231,235,144,7,193,59,7,11,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
