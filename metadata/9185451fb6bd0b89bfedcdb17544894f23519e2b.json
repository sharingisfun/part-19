The near-disasters-turned-triumphs in ``Secret Space Escapes'' are expressed solely from the point of view of the men and women who problem-solved each event. There is no narration in the series and the stories unfold exclusively in the words of the people who were there. Chilling accounts of the challenges of space exploration feature launches, space walks, landings, collisions, outages, and other dangerous situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Fire on the MIR \r\nIn 1997 astronauts and cosmonauts Alexsandr on MIR deals with a life-threatening cabin fire and an out-of-control cargo ship; in 2001 astronaut Chris Hadfield's rookie spacewalk takes a terrifying turn leaving him temporarily blinded in space.\r\n\r\n2)  Shipwrecked \r\nIn 1997 on board the Russian Space Station Mir a collision put a hole in the station and the vacuum of space bares down; another astronaut's first spacewalk becomes a nightmare when he and his partner have only the oxygen in their suits to survive.\r\n\r\n3)  Secret Mission Mayday \r\nA Space Shuttle crew discovers damage to protective tiles on the shuttle's underbelly that could kill them during re-entry in temperatures up to 3000 degrees.\r\n\r\n4)  Toxic Leak \r\nAn astronaut is exposed to a toxic ammonia leak while performing a spacewalk to connect ISS lifelines; an astronaut's helmet fills with water, threatening to drown him.\r\n\r\n5)  Point of No Return \r\nA spacewalker loses his eye sight and is locked outside his craft after a spacesuit malfunction; Cosmonauts are engulfed by a fire while still on the launchpad; a shuttle mission is aborted T-4 seconds before launch, but the crew doesn't know why.\r\n\r\n6)  Gasping for Air \r\nA toxic leak put the lives of astronauts at risk upon re-entry; an epic mission to the Salyut space station takes an unexpected turn; Astronauts fear for their safety when an engine malfunctions at takeoff.\r\n\r\n7)  Abandon Ship \r\nA power failure occurs on the ISS forcing the crew to consider abandoning the station, although damage has been found on the shuttle that could comprise them upon re-entry. During the first spacewalk a cosmonaut is nearly stranded after a suit malfunction.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen0.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen1.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen2.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5d/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen3.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen4.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen5.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d6/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen6.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen7.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen8.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen9.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen10.jpg \r\n   \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/eb/Secret-Space-Escapes-Season-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3158 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 7\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 971 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9185451fb6bd0b89bfedcdb17544894f23519e2b","amp;dn":"Secret.Space.Escapes.Series.1.4of7.Toxic.Leak.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9185451fb6bd0b89bfedcdb17544894f23519e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,133,69,31,182,189,11,137,191,237,205,177,117,68,137,79,35,81,158,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
