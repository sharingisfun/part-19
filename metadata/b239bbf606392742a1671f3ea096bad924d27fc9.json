It's also true that lead singer Mickey Thomas had decamped to join Jefferson Starship, leaving Bishop to reestablish his country blues boy persona. But Maria Muldaur had signed on (she sings lead on &quot;True Love&quot;), and with two years between studio albums, Bishop had found the time to write some good vehicles for his guitar work and Southern rock backup band. ~ William Ruhlmann\n\nPersonnel: Elvin Bishop (vocals, electric &amp; slide guitars); Maria Mauldaur, William Schuler (vocals); Amos Garrett (acoustic &amp; electric guitars, coral sitar); Johnny &quot;V&quot; Vernazza (guitar); Applejack (harmonica); Jerry McKinney, Terry Hanck, Danny Armstrong, Jules Broussard (horns); Melvin Seals (acoustic &amp; electric pianos, organ, synthesizer); Phil Aaberg (acoustic &amp; electric pianos, celeste); Maurice Cridlin (bass); Scott Matthews (drums, percussion); Rick Jaeger (drums).The Gospel Clouds: Gerald Dayce, Lenoard Lothlen, Hymes Hollis, Jr., Charles Holland (background vocals).\n\n\n1.It's a Feelin'\n2.Arkansas\n3.True Love\n4.Southern Dreams\n5.Waterfalls\n6.Oh Babe\n7.Let's Break Down\n8.Right Now Is the Hour\n9.Midnight Creeper\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b239bbf606392742a1671f3ea096bad924d27fc9","amp;dn":"Elvin+Bishop++Hog+Heaven+%28rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b239bbf606392742a1671f3ea096bad924d27fc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,57,187,246,6,57,39,66,161,103,31,62,160,150,186,217,36,210,127,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
