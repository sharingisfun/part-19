John McMurry\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s ORGANIC CHEMISTRY is consistently praised as the most clearly written book available for the course. In John McMurry\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s words: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;I wrote this book because I love writing. I get great pleasure and satisfaction from taking a complicated subject, turning it around until I see it clearly from a new angle, and then explaining it in simple words.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Through his lucid writing and ability to show the beauty and logic of organic chemistry, M\nBooknews\n\nThe textbook uses a dual organization that blends the traditional functional-group approach with a mechanistic approach. The primary organization is by functional group, beginning with the simple alkenes and progressing to the more complex carbonyl group and biomolecules. The updated fifth edition adds sections on acid-base strength, organic acids and bases, and curved-arrow formalism. Annotation c.
