This was excluded because the issue hadn't been scanned yet at the time of the original compilation)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Prelude 01-02 (Excluded from the original compilation as not all issues had been released yet)\n\nIron Man One-Shot - The Coming of the Melter (Don't ask me why this was excluded from the original compilation, I'm not sure. I give a lot of credit to VikTSlick for the original compilation, but it appears this issue was missed. Although this issue isn't included on wikipedia in the cinematic universe, it is included on the official wikias for it, and throughout the comic you can see Cinematic Universe exclusive locations/artifacts.)\n\nAnd finally, an Image showing the Phase 1 Timeline of all the events that ocurred in Phase 1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0ba74184c5cb283be5874745acb19fcf2c842c3","amp;dn":"Missing+MCU+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0ba74184c5cb283be5874745acb19fcf2c842c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,186,116,24,76,92,178,131,190,88,116,116,90,203,25,252,242,200,66,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
