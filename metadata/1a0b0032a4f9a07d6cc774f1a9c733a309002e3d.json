Always somewhat of a joke, the quartet did manage to release a self-titled album of cover songs that they had recorded in 1987 with leftover studio time. Loose and spirited, the group tackles a range of off-the-cuff covers that could be throwaways but for the sheer talent and charm of the players. Indeed, their spirited rendition of PrinceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rasberry BeretÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ even made the charts in 1990. A pair of Robert Johnson-penned blues classics and Muddy WatersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mannish BoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are attempted with similar aplomb. HINDU LOVE GODS is a rare kind of supergroup album: good-natured, unpretentious, irreverent, inebriated, and ultimately essential.\n\n\nWalkin' Blues\nTravellin' Riverside Blues\nRasberry Beret\nCrosscut Saw\nJunko Pardner\nMannish Boy\nWang Dang Doodle\nBattleship Chains\nI'm a One Woman Man\nVigilante Man\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a0b0032a4f9a07d6cc774f1a9c733a309002e3d","amp;dn":"Hindu+Love+Gods+-+Warren+Zevon+%26amp%3B+R.E.M.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a0b0032a4f9a07d6cc774f1a9c733a309002e3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,11,0,50,164,249,160,125,108,199,116,241,169,199,51,163,9,0,46,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
