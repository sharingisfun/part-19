Sibelius was born in southern Finland, the second of three children. His physician father left the family bankrupt, owing to his financial extravagance, a trait that, along with heavy drinking, he would pass on to Jean. Jean showed talent on the violin and at age nine composed his first work for it, Rain Drops. In 1885 Sibelius entered the University of Helsinki to study law, but after only a year found himself drawn back to music. He took up composition studies with Martin Wegelius and violin with Mitrofan Wasiliev, then Hermann Csillag. During this time he also became a close friend of Busoni.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1887547b6d71274fd54dda5852040ec3ac1b2585","amp;dn":"Jean+Sibelius+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1887547b6d71274fd54dda5852040ec3ac1b2585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,135,84,123,109,113,39,79,213,77,218,88,82,4,14,195,172,27,37,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
