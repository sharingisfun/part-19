For a price, you have access to the most devious devices, but how you use them will determine if you retire as a millionaire or get permanently retired.\n\nThe Hitman is the world's most accomplished and wealthy assassin; however, he is plagued by a troubling past of deception and genetic butchery. The ingenious story will evolve over five chapters of heart-stopping action. Remember, the world of contract hits rewards a quick intellect more than a quick trigger finger.\n\nInstructions:\n1 - Mount or burn image\n2 - Run setup\n3 - Play\n4 - SEED\n\nPLEASE SEED AFTER YOUR DOWNLOAD IS FINISH.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deb40b9cbe49f16712ec49e16d1ecd801e4e449e","amp;dn":"Hitman+Codename+47-Full-%5B168MB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deb40b9cbe49f16712ec49e16d1ecd801e4e449e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,180,11,156,190,73,241,103,18,236,73,225,109,30,205,128,30,78,68,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
