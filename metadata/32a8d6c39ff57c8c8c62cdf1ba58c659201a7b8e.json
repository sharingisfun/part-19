Alongside his oldest friend and brilliant colleague, Augustus Garret, he and his forces saved Earth from invasion by the robotic legions of the First Imperiumâ€™s insane computer Regent.\r\n\r\nThere is just one problem. The First Imperium was held back by the disruption of the sole warp gate connecting the two domainsâ€¦and Compton and 300 of his ships are trapped on the wrong side, surrounded by the Regentâ€™s vast fleets and cut off from Earth.\r\n\r\nPursued by their deadly enemy, Compton and his fleet must flee into the darkness of unexplored space, seeking safetyâ€¦and ultimately a new home. Their journey will take them deep into the heart of the First Imperium, to the silent, windswept worlds where the ancient race that built the Regent once dwelledâ€¦and uncover the lost secrets of its disappearance 500,000 years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32a8d6c39ff57c8c8c62cdf1ba58c659201a7b8e","amp;dn":"Jay+Allan+-+Into+the+Darkness+%28Crimson+Worlds+Refugees%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32a8d6c39ff57c8c8c62cdf1ba58c659201a7b8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,168,214,195,159,245,124,140,140,98,205,241,186,88,198,89,32,26,123,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
