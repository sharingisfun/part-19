Less mechanized than before, and with slashes of brilliant color punctuating the sepia tones. Ridgway plays more guitar on tracks like &quot;Lonely Town&quot;, an evocative, melting journey past desert sands and sagebrush while Pietra Wexstun, Tori Amos, Steve Berlin and Marc Ribot help round out the musical contributions. \n\nWith the songs &quot;Goin' Southbound&quot; and &quot;Calling Out To Carol&quot;, (another top 5 European hit), Ridgway was off again on a world-wide tour. The searingly introspective, bar-room blues meets Existential-Humanist, &quot;Mission In Life&quot; becomes a traditional closer of the tour's performances with the poignantly embittered line, &quot;I give 'em oceans to drink, but then they drown in the tide.&quot; \n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nStan Ridgway - vocals, harmonica, piano, guitar\nEric Williams - guitar\nMarc Ribot - guitar\nJoe Ramirez, Tim Landers - bass\nJoe Berardi - drums\nSteve Reid - percussion\nBernard Hall, Jim Lang, Pietra Wexstun - keyboards\nLarry Grennan, Pietra Wexstun, Tori Amos - background vocals\nSteve Berlin - saxophone on &quot;Dogs&quot;\nVan Dyke Parks - string arrangement on &quot;Heat Takes a Walk&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.&quot;Heat Takes A Walk&quot; - 2:43\n2.&quot;Lonely Town&quot; - 4:09\n3.&quot;Goin' Southbound&quot; - 4:42\n4.&quot;Dogs&quot; - 4:05\n5.&quot;Can't Complain&quot; - 3:49\n6.&quot;Peg And Pete And Me&quot; - 4:41\n7.&quot;Newspapers&quot; - 2:41\n8.&quot;Calling Out To Carol&quot; - 4:04\n9.&quot;The Last Honest Man&quot; - 4:01\n10.&quot;A Mission In Life&quot; - 5:53\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7d782a11c2d0fb6525dcde39aa236ebcd1c1662","amp;dn":"Stan+Ridgway+-+Mosquitos++%5B1989%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7d782a11c2d0fb6525dcde39aa236ebcd1c1662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,215,130,161,28,45,15,182,82,93,205,227,154,162,54,235,205,28,22,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
