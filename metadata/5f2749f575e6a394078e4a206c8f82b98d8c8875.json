Many inside the company were eager to prove that Apple could be just as innovative as it had been under Jobs. Others were painfully aware of the immense challenge ahead. As its business has become more complex and global, Apple has come under intense scrutiny, much of it critical. Maintaining market leadership has become crucial as it tries to conquer new frontiers and satisfy the public's insatiable appetite for &quot;insanely great&quot; products.\n\nBased on over 200 interviews with current and former executives, business partners, Apple watchers, and others, Haunted Empire is an illuminating portrait of Apple today that offers clues to its future. With nuanced insights and colorful details that only a seasoned journalist could glean, Kane goes beyond the myths and headlines. She explores Tim CookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership and its impact on JobsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ loyal lieutenants, new product development, and AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationships with Wall Street, the government, tech rivals, suppliers, the media, and consumers.\n\nHard-hitting yet fair, Haunted Empire reveals the perils and opportunities an iconic company faces when it loses its visionary leader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f2749f575e6a394078e4a206c8f82b98d8c8875","amp;dn":"Haunted+Empire%3A+Apple+After+Steve+Jobs+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f2749f575e6a394078e4a206c8f82b98d8c8875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,39,73,245,117,230,163,148,7,142,74,32,108,143,130,185,141,140,136,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
