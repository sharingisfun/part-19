You can also leverage legacy Pro/DIAGRAM schematics and drive your 3D CAD designs.\n\n\nCreo Schematics provides all the capabilities that designers of piping and cabling systems need to easily capture the logical connectivity information in 2D schematics. Included with Creo PCX, Creo Schematics Lite is an intro- ductory schematic tool that can grow with your design needs. Advanced capabilities, such as design reuse support, multi-user capabilities, customization for design automation, and central catalog, can be added optionally.\n\nVersion: 2.0 Build F000 32bit\n\nCreator: www.ptc.com\n\nInterface: Chinese Simplified, English, German, French, Japanese\n\nOS: Windows XP / Vista / Seven","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:300521281376e2d60d62bb28d9908d7f597b0cfb","amp;dn":"PTC+Creo+Schematics+%28ex+Routed+Systems+Designer%29+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"300521281376e2d60d62bb28d9908d7f597b0cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,5,33,40,19,118,226,214,13,98,187,40,217,144,141,127,89,123,12,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
