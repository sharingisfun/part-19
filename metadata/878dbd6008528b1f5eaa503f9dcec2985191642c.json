Two\nyears on from their top five debut St. Jude, Liam Fray and his\nMiddleton homeboys present an album to seal their role as the\nStereoasisphonics-lookalikes that itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s okay to like. These are strong,\nconventional songs full of clever flicks and feints, deliciously\nproduced by Ed (Suede, Pulp, White Lies) Buller. That FrayÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s savvy,\ngritty-funny lyrics will be compared to Alex TurnerÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s just emphasises\nthat arch couplets are so rare in pop today that we only have one\nreference point outside Moz himself.\n\nMost tracks bounce at a comfortable mid-pace, ensuring maximum\nsing-along factor, and perhaps Falcon flags before its end. Yet Buller\nensures that even the most throwaway boast cunning builds and kinks,\nand FrayÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s narratives compel you to hear the rest of the story. By now\nyouÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ll know radio favourite You Overdid It Doll, its mildly cautionary\ntale of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´a space cadet dressed in fibre glassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ driven by a catchy\nrhythmic motif thatÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s curiously reminiscent of Rod StewartÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s critically\nunassailable classic DÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ya Think IÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â m Sexy? If that wasnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t enough for\nwhite-trash-disco fans, BlondieÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s Heart of Glass is later name-checked\nby the boys.\n\nDonÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t be misled, though: this remains ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦indie-rockÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â , albeit tanned and\ntarted-up like one of the girls on a night out in FrayÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s songs. Yes,\nArctic Monkeys would be the closest thing ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» somewhere between Favourite\nWorst Nightmare and Humbug ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» but there are enough musical flourishes\nand pining ballads to earn the band the Elbow comparisons they\nblatantly desire. (To show theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve got, you know, soul.) ItÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s hard to\nresent their straining when they do it with this muscular elegance.\n\nMaybe these songs lose their everyman anthem cred when Fray lurches\ninto second album clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s of the\npoor-me-the-rock-god-missing-my-bird-cos-IÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â m-on-the-road-beating-off-gr\noupies-with-a-stick variety. And the would-be showstopper Last of the\nLadies, is plain soppy. But at its best ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Cross My Heart &amp; Hope to Fly,\nScratch Your Name Upon My Lips, the reflective The Rest of the World\nHas Gone Home, the heated Sycophant  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» this is distinctive and\nimpressive. Falcon will set The Courteeners soaring.\n\nDeluxe edition including a bonus cd of 5 extra tracks. Enjoy! \n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\nDISC 1:\n\n01.
