His personal life unraveling, the investigation takes Sean back into a world of violence and pain he thought he'd left behind. It also puts him on a collision course with Jimmy Marcus - a man with his own dark past who is eager to solve the crime with brutal justice. And then there is Dave Boyle, a man who hides monstrous secrets beneath a bland facade - secrets his wife, Celeste, is only beginning to suspect. As the race for a killer heats up, all are pulled closer toward an abyss that will force them to face their true selves - and will mark them as irrevocably as the past itself.\n\n&quot;Lehane is one of those brave new detective stylists who is not afraid of fooling around with the genre's traditions.&quot; (Washington Post Book World)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c638edc9068d3c77e9bd3c6d4923648a87eb441","amp;dn":"Mystic+River+-+Dennis+Lehane-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c638edc9068d3c77e9bd3c6d4923648a87eb441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,99,142,220,144,104,211,199,126,155,211,198,212,146,54,72,168,126,180,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
