A persona can be damaged and even knocked out, effectively halving a characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abilities during the healing period. The four-button combat system has only strong and weak attacks, each for you and your persona, and features single button autocombos to ease novices into the mechanics. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“BurstÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ combo provides a get-out-of-jail-free card (if you have a full burst meter)Ã¢â‚¬â€œif youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re getting hammered, you can knock your opponent away with a short stun and a little damage. The hardcore neednÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t despair though, as further combos and quarter-circle specials allow flowing chains of satisfaction, with the added interplay of simultaneous persona and character combat bringing a host of techniques to the table.\n\nA Lesson mode is also included, a welcome feature in a notoriously inaccessible genre, developing on BlazBlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tutorial with smoother transitions between exercises. The mode provides lessons, from moving all the up way to runs of combos and the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three types of guard. ArenaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s online Versus mode, with all 13 characters available from the off, utilises the same successful netcode as BlazBlue, promising a smooth experience at broadband speeds. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to move from intermediate to advanced level, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll benefit from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“record a comboÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feature, where you can teach the computer to attack with a specific move, allowing you to perfect a counter. ArenaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Challenge mode, similar to Lesson mode, allows fluid transition to the next task with no bothersome loading screens to break up the flow of play.\n\nPlatform: XBOX360\nRegion: NTSC/U\nFormat: XGD2\nSize: 1 DVD\nLanguage: English\nGenre: Fighting\n\nTrailer:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-CE82_501CCE2C.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-CE82_501CCE2C.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-50B7_501CCE2C.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-50B7_501CCE2C.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-74D3_501CCE2C.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-74D3_501CCE2C.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbdf8407ddbdcb2f79e0dc91cfffca21b8d27d65","amp;dn":"Persona+4+Arena+NTSC+XBOX360-iMARS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbdf8407ddbdcb2f79e0dc91cfffca21b8d27d65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,223,132,7,221,189,203,47,121,224,220,145,207,255,202,33,184,210,125,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
