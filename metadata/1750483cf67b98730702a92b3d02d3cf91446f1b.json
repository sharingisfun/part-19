In A History of Marriage, Elizabeth Abbott paints an often surprising picture of this most public, yet most intimate, institution. Ritual of romance, or social obligation? Eternal bliss, or cult of domesticity? Abbott reveals a complex tradition that includes same-sex unions, arranged marriages, dowries, self-marriages, and child brides. MarriageÃ¢â‚¬â€in all its loving, unloving, decadent, and impoverished manifestationsÃ¢â‚¬â€is revealed here through Abbott's infectious curiosity.\n\nAbout the Author\nElizabeth Abbott is a writer, lecturer and historian with a special interest in women's issues, social justice, the treatment of animals, and the environment. She has a doctorate from McGill University in 19th century history. Her most recent book, A History of Marriage, completes her trilogy about human relationships following A History of Celibacy and A History of Mistresses. A History of Marriage was nominated for the Governor General's Literary Award for Non-Fiction. Her previous book, Sugar: A Bittersweet History, inspired by her Antiguan heritage, was short-listed for the 2009 Charles Taylor Prize for Literary Non-Fiction.
