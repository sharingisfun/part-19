A few big changes mark the jump from GameCube to PS2 -- in this version, you may have either a boy or a girl once you've been married, and there are now four wives to woo with the addition of the lovely Lumina, and continued building of your farm is allowed once you've completed the story campaign.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9959f5deea5f0c730feb6937adb01b83f76be5d3","amp;dn":"Harvest+Moon%3A+A+Wonderful+Life+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9959f5deea5f0c730feb6937adb01b83f76be5d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,89,245,222,234,95,12,115,15,235,105,55,173,176,27,131,247,107,229,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
