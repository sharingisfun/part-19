Aided by an optical illusion-filled music video that received substantial airplay on MTV, &quot;Hourglass&quot; became the highest charting hit the band ever had in the United States, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, while reaching number 16 in the UK Singles Chart. \n\nEric &quot;ET&quot; Thorngren produced the album, and former Soft Boys member Andy Metcalfe made his only appearance as an official member of Squeeze on the album. He would end up writing again with Glenn Tilbrook during his solo years.\n\nThe album was released in September of 1987 and gave them their biggest U.S. hit, &quot;Hourglass.&quot; The song became an unexpected U.S. hit for the band, reaching #15 on the Billboard Hot 100, which Chris Difford attributed to the video for the song as much as the song itself: &quot;I would think that the video has had a lot to do with it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been played a lot, and everybody you speak to compliments you on it. When you meet fans after gigs, they say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your videoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the first thing they think of.&quot;\n\n\nSqueeze, who formed in Deptford, London in 1974, is a British band who came to prominence in the United Kingdom during the new wave period of the late 1970s and continued recording successfully in the 1980s and 1990s. They are known in the UK for their hit songs &quot;Cool for Cats&quot;, &quot;Up the Junction&quot;, &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Labelled with Love&quot;, &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot;, &quot;Another Nail in My Heart&quot;, &quot;Pulling Mussels (from the Shell)&quot; and &quot;Hourglass&quot;. Though not as commercially successful in the United States, Squeeze had American chart hits with &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Hourglass&quot; and &quot;853-5937&quot;, and they have a dedicated following there and continue to attract new fans. All of Squeeze's hits were written by band members Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, with the former penning the lyrics and the latter handling the composition. The duo were hailed as &quot;the heirs to Lennon and McCartney's throne&quot; during their peak of popularity in the early 1980s. \n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourglass_(Squeeze_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourglass_(Squeeze_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/bq273wwfx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/bq273wwfx/&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:03:10\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
