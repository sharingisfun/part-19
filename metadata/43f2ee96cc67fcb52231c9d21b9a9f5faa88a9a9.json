More than 100 years later, they are still using the original recipe. Tillamook Cheese is an award-winning American favorite and a household name. Over the years some of the greatest cheese recipes in the world have been developed, tested, and tasted in anticipation of the release of this one of a kind cookbook.\nThe Tillamook Cheese Cookbook includes recipes such as Cheddar Scallion Biscuits, Cheesy Chicken Tetrazzini, and Twice-baked Cheese SoufflÃƒÂ© with Deviled Crab Sauce. An entire section is devoted to the Queen of comfort FoodÃ¢â‚¬â€Mac nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Cheese. Each year, the co-op sponsors a Mac nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Cheese recipe contest, and this cookbook includes the best warm and creamy, cheesy and sinfully delicious macaroni and cheese recipes from across the nation. \n\nTable of Contents\nForeword .... .............................. .. xi\nPreface .... .............................. .. xiii\nIntroduction . ............................... xv\nHow to Make Cheese ....................... xxvi\nAppetizers\nSoups, Salads, and Sides\nSandwiches &amp; Pizza\nMac &amp; Cheese\nMain Course\nBreakfast &amp; Brunch\nDesserts\nBack Matter\nCredits .... .............................. .. 190\nIndex. .... .............................. .. 191","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f2ee96cc67fcb52231c9d21b9a9f5faa88a9a9","amp;dn":"The+Tillamook+Cheese+Cookbook+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f2ee96cc67fcb52231c9d21b9a9f5faa88a9a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,242,238,150,204,103,252,181,34,49,201,210,27,154,159,95,170,136,169,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
