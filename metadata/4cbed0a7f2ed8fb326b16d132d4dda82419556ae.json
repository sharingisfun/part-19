Olives are not only a significant food source, but also contribute to human health and are becoming popular in health-conscious diets far beyond their Mediterranean origins.Reviewing an extensive array of literature from both a theoretical and practical perspective, this comprehensive guide deals with all aspects of olive culture, from its history, origins and traditional techniques to the latest horticultural procedures and basic physiology. The book's accessible and broadly illustrated format makes it an indispensable text for students, interested individuals and both active and amateur horticulturists.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 432 pages\n    * Publisher: CABI; First edition (December 17, 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 184593458X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1845934583","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cbed0a7f2ed8fb326b16d132d4dda82419556ae","amp;dn":"Olives+%28Crop+Production+Science+in+Horticulture%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cbed0a7f2ed8fb326b16d132d4dda82419556ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,190,208,167,242,237,143,179,38,177,109,19,45,77,218,130,65,149,86,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
