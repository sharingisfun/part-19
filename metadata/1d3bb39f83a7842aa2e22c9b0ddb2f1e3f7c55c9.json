Sorry, no more legal-tracker.de so you just have to search here for new updates.\n\nAs always, this is the official shark007 codecs, bundled both 32- and 64-bit. But now this has been renamed to Advanced codecs instead of Windows 7 codecs, since Windows 8 is supported as well. I decided to mention it another way in the torrent title.\n\nBe aware that shark007 codecs now inclode even more adware, so be careful to skip the installation of the adware and to only install the codecs. I decided not to change the original files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d3bb39f83a7842aa2e22c9b0ddb2f1e3f7c55c9","amp;dn":"Windows+7+and+Windows+8+Codecs+%282013-08-03%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d3bb39f83a7842aa2e22c9b0ddb2f1e3f7c55c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,59,179,159,131,167,132,42,162,226,44,155,13,219,47,30,63,124,85,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
