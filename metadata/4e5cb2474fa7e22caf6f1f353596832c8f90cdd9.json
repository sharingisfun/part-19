Filled with in-depth insights from experts at McKinsey &amp; Company, this reliable resource takes a much more qualitative approach to what the authors consider a lost art.\n\nDiscusses the four foundational principles of corporate finance\nEffectively applies the theory of value creation to our economy\nExamines ways to maintain and grow value through mergers, acquisitions, and portfolio management\nAddresses how to ensure your company has the right governance, performance measurement, and internal discussions to encourage value-creating decisions\nA perfect companion to the Fifth Edition of Valuation, this book will put the various issues associated with corporate finance in perspective.\n\nReview\n\n'...marches the reader through the very practical issues that affect value.' (Financial Times, November 2010).\n\nFrom the Inside Flap\n\nFrom the team behind ValuationÃ¢â‚¬â€the #1 bestselling reference on corporate financeÃ¢â‚¬â€comes a decision-making guide for all executives to use as they create, manage, and sustain shareholder value.\n\nCorporate leaders are regularly confronted with conventional wisdom and half-truths about value creation. They're given conflicting advice about what will or won't appeal to investors, often contradicting their own judgment about what builds lasting worth in their companies and the economy.\n\nIn Value: The Four Cornerstones of Corporate Finance, partners from the management consulting firm of McKinsey &amp; Company describe the basic principles of value creation and their relevance. Internalizing these principlesÃ¢â‚¬â€or cornerstonesÃ¢â‚¬â€gives decision makers the independence and courage they need to challenge conventional wisdom, defy half-truths, and build thriving businesses.\n\nThe four cornerstones are:\n\nThe Core of Value: a business's value is driven by its growth and return on capital, and resulting cash flows\n\nThe Conservation of Value: value is created when companies generate higher cash flows, not by simply rearranging investors' claims on cash flows\n\nThe Expectations Treadmill: movements in company share prices reflect changes in the stock market's expectations, not just underlying performance\n\nThe Best Owner: the value of a business is not an absolute but, rather, depends on who is managing it and the strategy pursued\n\nWhile there are many books that cover selected topics within corporate financeÃ¢â‚¬â€often for specialized practitionersÃ¢â‚¬â€it's the rare book that offers leaders a unifying viewpoint of business. Value is that book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e5cb2474fa7e22caf6f1f353596832c8f90cdd9","amp;dn":"Value%3A+The+Four+Cornerstones+of+Corporate+Finance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e5cb2474fa7e22caf6f1f353596832c8f90cdd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,92,178,71,79,167,226,44,175,111,31,53,53,150,131,44,143,144,205,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
