Marcello Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale are happily married until she\nfinds out he&amp;#039;s impotent. It takes her a year to find this out, which ought to give an indication of how seriously we&amp;#039;re supposed to take this film. Also risible is the fact that Mastrioanni bears the reputation of a fabulous lover, as do practically all the members of his family. Nonetheless, he stands by like a dummy when Cardinale&amp;#039;s father forces her to annul the marriage and wed another. It&amp;#039;s all nonsense, of course, but Pasolini and his collaborators weave their tale so \npersuasively that one forgives the film&amp;#039;s utter lack of credibility.\n\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Bell&amp;#039;Antonio.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 1584 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 6.29 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Italiano\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 1388 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 544 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.147\n      StreamSize : 979 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 135 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0053643\n\nItalian audio, English, French, spanish and Portuguese subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae2d3d376e75a4638f257d3f130cf5423bb275cc","amp;dn":"Bell%5C%27Antonio+-+Mauro+Bolognini+%281960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae2d3d376e75a4638f257d3f130cf5423bb275cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,45,61,55,110,117,164,99,143,37,125,63,19,12,245,66,59,178,117,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
