After bravely saving the life of the Sir Arthur Wellesley (the future \nDuke of Wellington), Sharpe is rewarded with a field commission, making him a \nlieutenant.  In command of the 95th Rifles under Captain Murray, Sharpe soon \nfinds that they are an undisciplined bunch.  Neither Murray nor the men of the \nRifles are prepared to accept Sharpe's command, because ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦properÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  officers are \nnot raised from the ranks. His first mission is to go behind enemy lines to \nlocate James Rothschild, an agent missing in Casa Antiga, with badly-needed \nfunds for the British army.\n\nSharpe has his first encounter with Commandante Teresa and Major Don Blas Vivar, \non watch in the hills when SharpeÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s company is attacked.  All except Sharpe and \na small band of Chosen Men are killed.  Sharpe continues with the mission he has \nbeen given, and Teresa and Blas Vivar agree to go with Sharpe to Casa Antiga if \nSharpe will accompany them on their own mission to Torrecastro afterwards.\n\nWhen they find Casa Antiga, it has been attacked by the French under Colonel de \nl'Eclin, but there is no sign of Rothschild.  Left behind are a Methodist \ncouple, Mr. and Mrs. Parker and their daughter Louisa.  The family are taken \ninto Sharpe's protection.\nSharpe discovers his real mission is to escort one of SpainÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s holiest relics, an \nancient flag, and he doesn't wish to continue to Torrecastro.  But Vivar's \nrequest is reinforced by the appearance of Maj. Hogan, Wellington's 'exploring \nofficer'.  Sharpe is ordered to hold the town while the relic of St. James is \nflown to inspire the Spanish to rise up against the French.\n\nCast: \nSean Bean as Lt.
