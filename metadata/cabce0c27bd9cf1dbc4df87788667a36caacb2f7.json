Just think of it as one long film, and watch the clips in order. The documentary is not in any other way affected. I am including the link to Iwo Jima on Wikipedia and additional sites to provide additional information, photographs and useful battle maps for those who are interested. Much of this is 1940s footage, so quality varies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.historyanimated.com/Iwo.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.historyanimated.com/Iwo.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ww2db.com/photo.php?source=all&amp;color=all&amp;list=search&amp;foreigntype=B&amp;foreigntype_id=12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ww2db.com/photo.php?source=all&amp;color=all&amp;list=search&amp;foreigntype=B&amp;foreigntype_id=12&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfortress&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfortress&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRambam1776\n\n\nTimeless Media Group presents ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIwo Jima ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 36 Days of HellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a documentary featuring over 25 interviews with veterans of the battle. The copy on the back of the boxed set reads as follows:\n\nIwo Jima was arguably the toughest battle the US Marines had ever faced. The courage and sacrifice of the men who fought to secure the eight square miles of stinking sulfuric rock and volcanic ash will never be forgotten.\n\nStep back in time with the sailors, soldiers, and airmen who were there, and relive one of the most famous battles of WWII. Told almost exclusively through color footage shot by Marine Corps cameramen and veteran interviews, this documentary tells the story of the battle for Iwo Jima through the eyes of those who lived through it. See why it is said that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“on Iwo Jima uncommon valor was a common virtue.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe first section is the documentary, the second selection is a collection of interviews, related documentaries on the Iwo Jima Memorial and the B-29 Superfortress Bomber, and some lengthy interviews.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cabce0c27bd9cf1dbc4df87788667a36caacb2f7","amp;dn":"Iwo+Jima+-+36+Days+of+Hell++%28WW2+Documentary+series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cabce0c27bd9cf1dbc4df87788667a36caacb2f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,188,224,194,123,217,207,29,188,77,248,119,136,102,122,54,202,172,178,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
