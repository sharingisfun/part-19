The album was recorded during the summer of the band's freshman year in high school. Despite the album being rushed into recording over summer vacation, and the band experiencing tension between themselves and their producer, the album was considered a mild success, and gained popularity over college airplay. Fans of the album claimed that Commander Venus could be &quot;the next big thing&quot; out of Omaha. The Uneventful Vacation continues to gain popularity even today as fans of Bright Eyes discover Conor Oberst's older material.&quot;\n\n\n\n   1. &quot;Jean's T.V.&quot;\n   2. &quot;Refused By Light&quot;\n   3. &quot;We'll Always Have Paris&quot;\n   4. &quot;The Uneventful Vacation (Part I)&quot;\n   5. &quot;Lock N' Chase&quot;\n   6. &quot;Life As Expected&quot;\n   7. &quot;The Way Things Had to Be&quot;\n   8. &quot;Dress to Please&quot;\n   9. &quot;Walk-Around Problem&quot;\n  10. &quot;My Collapsing Frame&quot;\n  11. &quot;The Raining Holiday (Part II)&quot;\n  12. &quot;The Role of the Hero in Antiquity&quot;\n\nQuality is 320kbps.
