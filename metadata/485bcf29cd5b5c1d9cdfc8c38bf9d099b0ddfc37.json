The million-selling &quot;Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron&quot; was the first and most successful of these novelty records in the fall of 1966, and its follow-up, &quot;The Return of the Red Baron,&quot; also made the Top 40.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-royal-guardsmen-p20273/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-royal-guardsmen-p20273/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by William Ruhlmann):\n\nOf course, the heart of this hour-long, 20-track compilation is the series of Snoopy novelty hits enjoyed by the Royal Guardsmen in the mid-'60s, starting with the million-selling &quot;Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron.&quot; The group had a few other singles chart entries, all of which are here, sometimes making reference to aerial themes (&quot;Airplane Song [My Airplane]&quot;). Though cute and catchy with their martial drumming and banjo picking, the Snoopy songs have a trash-rock quality in the tradition of &quot;Louie, Louie&quot; and &quot;Hang on, Sloopy.&quot; Elsewhere, the group veers from one mid-'60s style to another, sometimes re-creating the good-time sound of the Lovin' Spoonful, other times using harmonies that sound like the Association, then resorting to covers (an instrumental version of &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock 'N Roll Star,&quot; &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;). Though they made four albums, this anthology, which brought them back into print in 1995, is a little more than anyone really needs of the Royal Guardsmen.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/anthology-r210545&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/anthology-r210545&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002R03&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002R03&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
