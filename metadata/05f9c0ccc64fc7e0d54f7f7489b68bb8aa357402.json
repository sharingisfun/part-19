The band, which was one of the first &quot;super-groups&quot;, released their only album, Blind Faith in August 1969. They were stylistically similar to the bands in which Winwood, Baker, and Clapton had most recently participated (Traffic and Cream).\nThe beginnings of Blind Faith date to mid-1968, with the break-up of Cream. In retrospect as &quot;the first super-group&quot;, Cream had become a financial powerhouse, selling millions of records within a few years and raising the group's (and each member's) repertoire to international popularity. Despite that success, the band was crumbling from within due to frequent animosity between Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, with Eric Clapton doing his best to mediate. In addition, Clapton had been tired of being coerced into playing commercially driven blues, and hoped to move forward with a new, experimental, less strait-jacketed approach to the genre.\nSteve Winwood was facing similar problems in The Spencer Davis Group, in which he had been the lead singer for three years. Winwood wanted to experiment with the band's sound by infusing jazz elements, but left due to his musical differences, instead forming a new band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Traffic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in 1967. That band split temporarily in 1969, and Winwood started to jam with his good friend Eric in Clapton's basement in Surrey, England. Winwood and Clapton had previously collaborated on the &quot;Powerhouse&quot; project.\nClapton was pleased with the jam sessions and looked seriously toward starting a trio with Winwood, but they needed a drummer. Ginger Baker turned up to sit in with them in 1969, and the band took near-final form. Clapton questioned letting Baker in the band, because he had promised Jack Bruce that, if they were to work with one another again, all three of them would play. Moreover, Clapton didn't want to reunite with Cream barely nine weeks after the break-up, and also didn't want to deal with another &quot;Cream-like&quot; super-stardom situation. Winwood ultimately persuaded Clapton to finalize Baker's inclusion in the line-up, arguing that Ginger Baker strengthened their musicianship and that it would be hard to find an equally talented drummer \nBy May 1969, Rick Grech, bassist with Family, was invited to join them (leaving Family, mid-tour). They laid down most of their album at Olympic Studios under the supervision of producer Jimmy Miller. Miller provided focus to the band, who often preferred jamming over the standard commercial 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“5 minute track. By then the group was known collectively as Blind Faith, a slyly cynical reference by Clapton to his outlook on the new group.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05f9c0ccc64fc7e0d54f7f7489b68bb8aa357402","amp;dn":"Blind+Faith-10+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05f9c0ccc64fc7e0d54f7f7489b68bb8aa357402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,249,192,204,198,79,199,224,213,79,127,116,137,182,139,184,170,53,116,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
