Formed in Long Island, New York, in 1982, Public Enemy is known for their politically charged lyrics and criticism of the American media, with an active interest in the frustrations and concerns of the African American community.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Public Enemy[1] number 44 on its list of the Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[2] Acclaimed Music ranks them the 29th most recommended musical act of all time and the highest hip-hop group.[3] The group was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2007.[4] The band were announced as inductees for the 2013 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on December 11, 2012, making them the fourth hip-hop act to be inducted after Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys. \n\n\nYo! Bum Rush The Show 1987\n\n\nYo! Bum Rush the Show is the debut album of American hip hop group Public Enemy, released in April 1987 on Def Jam Recordings.[1] The group's logo, a silhouette of a black man in a rifle's crosshairs, is debuted on the album's cover.[2] Yo! Bum Rush the Show features a sample-heavy sound by production team The Bomb Squad.\n\nThe album peaked at number 125 on the U.S. Billboard Top LPs chart and at number 28 on the Top Black Albums chart.[3] NME magazine named it the best album of the year in its 1987 critics poll.[4] Along with the Beastie Boys Licensed to Ill (1986) and LL Cool J's Radio (1985), music writer Cheo H. Coker has cited Yo! Bum Rush the Show as one of three of the most influential albums in hip hop history.[5] In 1998, it was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums. In 2003, the album was ranked number 497 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAccording to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, &quot;From its first album, Yo! Bum Rush the Show in 1987, the group marketed itself as a distillation of black anger and resistance. It set out to be the voice of a community, not just one more posse of boasters&quot;.[2] Yo! Bum Rush the Show debuts The Bomb Squad's sample-heavy production style, which is prominent on the group's following work.[7] Joe Brown of The Washington Post described the album's music as &quot;a more serious brand of inner-city aggression&quot;, in comparison to Licensed to Ill (1986) by Def Jam label-mates the Beastie Boys.[8] On its musical style, Brown wrote &quot;Public Enemy's mean and minimalist rap is marked by an absolute absence of melody - the scary sound is just a throbbing pulse, hard drums and a designed-to-irritate electronic whine, like a dentist's drill or a persistent mosquito&quot;.[8] The album's sound is accented by the scratching of DJ Terminator X.[9] Chicago Tribune writer Daniel Brogan described Public Enemy's style on the album as &quot;raw and confrontational&quot;, writing that the group &quot;doesn't aim to -- or have a chance at -- crossing over.\n\n\nQ magazine (9/95, p. 132) - 4 Stars - Excellent - &quot;...a stunning opening...just the first, in retrospect almost shy, step on a remarkable journey...a hard, droning extension of the basic drum`n'scratch Def Jam template that had served LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys so well.&quot;\n\nMelody Maker (7/22/95, p. 35) - Recommended - &quot;It wasn't just a new sound, a discovery. It was like being struck by a meteor.&quot;\n\nNME (9/25/93, p. 19) - Ranked #49 in NME's list of The 50 Greatest Albums Of The '80s.\n\nNME (7/15/95, p. 47) - 9 (out of 10) - &quot;Yo! Bum Rush The Show announced a hip-hop group who smouldered beneath dark, sparse beats like no other, introduced us to the coolest vocal double act ever...and featured as striking a statement of intent as you could wish for in `Public Enemy Number 1'....brilliant.&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;You're Gonna Get Yours&quot; (Chuck D, Hank Shocklee) - 4:04\n2.\t&quot;Sophisticated Bitch&quot; featuring Vernon Reid of Living Colour (Chuck D, William Drayton, Flavor Flav, Shocklee) - 4:30\n3.\t&quot;Miuzi Weighs a Ton&quot; (Chuck D, Shocklee) - 5:44\n4.\t&quot;Timebomb&quot; (Chuck D, Shocklee) - 2:54\n5.\t&quot;Too Much Posse&quot; (Chuck D, Drayton, Flav, Shocklee) - 2:25\n6.\t&quot;Rightstarter (Message to a Black Man)&quot; (Chuck D, Shocklee) - 3:48\n7.\t&quot;Public Enemy No. 1&quot; (Chuck D, Shocklee) - 4:41\n8.\t&quot;M.P.E.&quot; (Chuck D, Drayton, Flav, Shocklee) - 3:44\n9.\t&quot;Yo!
