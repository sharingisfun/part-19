And for as long as anyone alive remembers, the ghostly Harper Bride has walked the halls, singing lullabies at night...\r\n\r\nBOOK 1: BLUE DAHLIA\r\n\r\n\r\nTrying to escape the ghosts of the past, young widow Stella Rothchild, along with her two energetic little boys, has moved back to her roots in southern Tennessee â€” and into her new life at Harper House and In the Garden nursery. She isn't intimidated by the house â€” nor its mistress, local legend Roz Harper. Despite a reputation for being difficult, Roz has been nothing but kind to Stella, offering her a comfortable new place to live and a challenging new job as manager of the flourishing nursery.\r\n\r\nAs Stella settles comfortably into her new life, she finds a nurturing friendship with Roz and with expectant mother Hayley. And she discovers a fierce attraction with ruggedly handsome landscaper Logan Kitridge.\r\n\r\nBut someone isn't happy about the budding romance... the Harper Bride. As the women dig into the history of Harper House, they discover that grief and rage have kept the Bride's spirit alive long past her death. And now, she will do anything to destroy the passion that Logan and Stella share.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nBOOK 2: BLACK ROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 45, Rosalind Harper is a woman whose experiences have made her strong enough to bend without breaking â€” and weather any storm. A widow with three grown sons, she survived a disastrous second marriage, and built her In the Garden nursery from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThrough the years, In the Garden has become more than just a thriving business â€” it is a symbol of hope and independence to Roz, and to the two women she shares it with. Newlywed Stella and new mother Hayley are the sisters of her heart, and together, the three of them are the future of In the Garden.\r\n\r\nBut now that future is under attack, and Roz knows they can't fight this battle alone. Hired to investigate Roz's Harper ancestors, Dr. Mitchell Carnegie finds himself just as intrigued with Roz herself. And as they begin to unravel the puzzle of the Harper Bride's identity, Roz is shocked to find herself falling for the fascinating genealogist.\r\n\r\nNow it is a desperate race to discover the truth before the unpredictable apparition lashes out at the one woman who can help her rest in peace.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nBOOK 3: RED LILY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHayley Phillips came to Memphis hoping for a new start, for herself and her unborn child. She wasn't looking for a handout from her distant cousin Roz, just a job at her thriving In the Garden nursery.\r\n\r\nWhat she found was a home surrounded by beauty and the best friends she's ever had â€” including Roz's son Harper. To Hayley's delight, her new daughter Lily has really taken to him. But to Hayley's chagrin, she has begun to dream about Harper â€” as much more than a friend.\r\n\r\nIf Hayley gives in to her desire, she's afraid the foundation she's built with Harper will come tumbling down. Especially since she's begun to suspect that her feelings are no longer completely her own.\r\n\r\nFlashes of the past and erratic behavior make Hayley believe that the Harper Bride has found a way inside of her mind and body. It's time to put the Bride to rest once and for all, so Hayley can know her own heart again â€” and whether she's willing to risk it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f48038538970550bb0eab67722c0eb3c1dd538f3","amp;dn":"In+the+Garden+Trilogy+-+Nora+Roberts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f48038538970550bb0eab67722c0eb3c1dd538f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,128,56,83,137,112,85,11,176,234,182,119,34,192,235,60,29,213,56,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
