After the war, the devils' power was banned and the world was restored to peace. Cecily Campbell is a knight, who has been looking for a blacksmith to repair her old sword given by her father. One day, she saw a man fighting with a ruffian who used the tabooed devil's power. The man defeated him with one blow of his weirdly shaped sword. The man turned out to be a blacksmith called Luke. The fateful encounter was the beginning of the adventure.\n\n\nEpisodes: 1 - 12\nSubs: Seto_Otaku\nCodec: 8bit H.264 720p\nAudio: 2-Channel AAC\n\n\nFiles in torrent:\n\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 01 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t432.4 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 02 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t324.4 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 03 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t339 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 04 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t441.7 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 05 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t314.7 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 06 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t398.3 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 07 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t298.9 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 08 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t347.9 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 09 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t362 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 10 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t342.3 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 11 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t313.3 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 12 [BD][720p][AAC].mp4\t369.4 MiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96ab7018176bca45eb938e4f72109231caa99fe","amp;dn":"%5BDeadFish%5D+Seiken+no+Blacksmith+-+Batch+%5BBD%5D%5B720p%5D%5BMP4%5D%5BAAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96ab7018176bca45eb938e4f72109231caa99fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,106,183,1,129,118,188,164,94,185,56,228,247,33,9,35,28,170,153,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
