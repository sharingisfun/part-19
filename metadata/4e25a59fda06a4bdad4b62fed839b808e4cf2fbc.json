It contains 22 tracks and 4 interviews recorded live at the BBC studios in London.  Between 21 October 1966 and 9 January 1968, Cream recorded eight sessions for the BBC radio network, selected highlights from seven of which are featured in chronological order on this collection.  Only the versions of &quot;Steppin' Out&quot; and &quot;Lawdy Mama&quot; had been previously released, although both were released on Eric Clapton's solo Crossroads box set, not by the band itself.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Sweet Wine\n[02] Eric Clapton Interview 1\n[03] Wrapping Paper\n[04] Rollin' and Tumblin'\n[05] Steppin' Out\n[06] Crossroads\n[07] Cat's Squirrel\n[08] Traintime\n[09] I'm So Glad\n[10] Lawdy Mama\n[11] Eric Clapton Interview 2\n[12] I Feel Free\n[13] N.S.U.\n[14] Four Until Late\n[15] Strange Brew\n[16] Eric Clapton Interview 3\n[17] Tales of Brave Ulysses\n[18] We're Going Wrong\n[19] Eric Clapton Interview 4\n[20] Born Under a Bad Sign\n[21] Outside Woman Blues\n[22] Take It Back\n[23] Sunshine of Your Love\n[24] Politician\n[25] SWLABR\n[26] Steppin' Out\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:08m:30s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 167mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
