Much maligned on initial release Ian Anderson now considers this album to contain some of Tulls finest music.  (see the liner notes on the remaster CD).\n\nThe first track is the worst quality, it only gets better from there and personally I just wish Flying Colours and Slow Marching Band could have been included and weaker songs like Sweet Dream and Pibroch dropped.\n\n01.The Clasp\n02.Fallen On Hard Times\n03.Pussy Willow\n04.Broadsword\n05.Jack In The Green\n06.Seal Driver\n07.Heavy Horses\n08.Keyboard/Drum Solo\n09.Sweet Dream\n10.Songs From The Wood\n11.Watching Me, Watching You\n12.Pibroch\n13.Beastie\n14.Too Old To Rock N Roll\n15.Cross-Eyed Mary\n16.Aqualung\n17.Minstrel In The Gallery\n18.Locomotive Breath\n19.Black Sunday Instrumental\n20.Cheerio\n\n[Total Running Time: 86:14]\n\n\nConcerts used:\n\nMay 2, 1982 Roma Teatro Tenda (Italian TV tracks)\nMay 28, 1982 Dortmund Westfalenhalle  (German TV tracks)\n\nGSpot reports the following;\n\nVideo:\nNTSC (720 x 480) 4:3 ratio\n29.970 fps\n6000 kbps bitrate\n\nAudio:\nLPCM\n\n\nNOTE: Most modern TVs or DVD Players are NTSC compatible so if you get black and white images yours isn't.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41b8df0ea0ad7074e5223171b00b82d4c8d3c982","amp;dn":"Jethro+Tull+-+Beasties+1982+%28Broadsword+Tour+Concert+DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41b8df0ea0ad7074e5223171b00b82d4c8d3c982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,184,223,14,160,173,112,116,229,34,49,113,176,11,130,212,200,211,201,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
