His unique adaptation of Charlie Parker's alto conception to the tenor saxophone is displayed throughout, revealing a mix of fluid, hard-toned lines and a vibrato-heavy and vaporous ballad sound. \n\nFrom the cover photo of Gordon (in a cowboy hat, saxophone slung over his shoulder, riding away on a horse) to the personnel (which includes Bud Powell, Max Roach and Art Blakey), Dexter Rides Again is a classic album. There are fine performances all around, and the album has the edgy, melody-conscious, tightly-knit ensemble feel of the best early bebop records. \n\nAnd while Gordon's ballad mastery would come to the fore on his come-back albums for Blue Note in the '60s, the tenor saxophonist primarily sticks to up-tempo material here, a standard for most bebop sets. Abetted by a collective cast including the fine, yet rarely heard trumpeter Leonard Hawkins, baritone saxophonist Leo Parker, pianists Tadd Dameron and Bud Powell, and drummers Max Roach and Art Blakey, Gordon is in top form on a typical collection of self-penned, utility tunes, dispensing of involved head statements in favor of solo space. \n\nStandouts include &quot;Dexter's Deck,&quot; the lone ballad &quot;I Can't Escape From You,&quot; and the jam session number &quot;Settin' The Pace&quot; (Gordon recorded many extended cuts like this with fellow bebop tenor star Wardell Gray, and here teams up with Leo Parker for something like a baritone and tenor cutting contest). For those interested in where elements of both Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane's distinct style came from, check out these fine Gordon sides; besides the history lesson on wax, there's a consistent run of top-notch bebop sides to enjoy.\n\n\nRecorded between October 30, 1945 and December 11, 1947.\n\n\nPersonnel: Dexter Gordon (tenor saxophone); Leo Parker (baritone saxophone); Leonard Hawkins (trumpet); Bud Powell, Tadd Dameron, Sadik Hakim (piano); Gene Ramey, Curly Russell (bass); Art Blakey, Max Roach, Ed Nicholson (drums).\n\n\nDown Beat (9/96, p.59) - 5 Stars - Excellent - &quot;...They go for broke, as Dexter digs in with a dry, Lestorian tone, logical flow of ideas and a fierce will to bop.&quot;\n\n\n01 Dexter's Riff   (Gordon)   2:44\n02 Settin' the Pace, Pts. 1 &amp; 2   (Gordon)   5:53\n03 So Easy   (Gordon)   2:43\n04 Long Tall Dexter   (Gordon)   3:04\n05 Dexter Rides Again   (Powell, Gordon)   3:15\n06 I Can't Escape from You   (Robin, Whiting)   3:16\n07 Dexter Digs In   (Gordon)   2:58\n08 Dexter's Minor Mad   (Gordon)   2:43\n09 Blow Mr. Dexter   (Gordon)   2:59\n10 Dexter's Deck    (Gordon)   2:57\n11 Dexter's Cuttin' Out   (Gordon)   3:10\n\n\n\nTracks 8-11\n\nRecorded in New York, on October 30, 1945\nDexter Gordon (tenor saxophone)\nSadik Hakim (piano)\nGene Ramey (bass)\nEd Nicholson (drums)\n\nTracks 4-7\n\nRecorded in New York, on January 29, 1946\nDexter Gordon (tenor saxophone)\nLeonard Hawkins (trumpet on tracks 4,5,7)\nBud Powell (piano)\nCurly Russell (bass)\nMax Roach (drums)\n\nTracks 1-3\n\nRecorded in New York, on December 11, 1947\nDexter Gordon (tenor saxophone)\nLeo Parker (baritone saxophone)\nTadd Dameron (piano)\nCurly Russell (bass)\nArt Blakey (drums)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca99b91e1e7909069645b2c592a1ed0aa260238","amp;dn":"Dexter+Gordon+-+Dexter+Rides+Again+%281945-47%29+%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca99b91e1e7909069645b2c592a1ed0aa260238","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,169,155,145,225,231,144,144,105,100,91,44,89,42,30,208,170,38,2,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
