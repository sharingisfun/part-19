It starts by introducing the key differences between Java and GroovyÃ¢â‚¬â€and how you can use them to your advantage. Then, it guides you step-by-step through realistic development challenges, from web applications to web services to desktop applications, and shows how Groovy makes them easier to put into production.\nAbout this Book\nYou don't need the full force of Java when you're writing a build script, a simple system utility, or a lightweight web appÃ¢â‚¬â€but that's where Groovy shines brightest. This elegant JVM-based dynamic language extends and simplifies Java so you can concentrate on the task at hand instead of managing minute details and unnecessary complexity.\nMaking Java Groov is a practical guide for developers who want to benefit from Groovy in their work with Java. It starts by introducing the key differences between Java and Groovy and how to use them to your advantage. Then, you'll focus on the situations you face every day, like consuming and creating RESTful web services, working with databases, and using the Spring framework. You'll also explore the great Groovy tools for build processes, testing, and deployment and learn how to write Groovy-based domain-specific languages that simplify Java development.\nWritten for developers familiar with Java. No Groovy experience required.\n\nWhat's Inside\n\nEasier Java\nClosures, builders, and metaprogramming\nGradle for builds, Spock for testing\nGroovy frameworks like Grails and Griffon\n\nAbout the Author\nKen Kousen is an independent consultant and trainer specializing in Spring, Hibernate, Groovy, and Grails.
