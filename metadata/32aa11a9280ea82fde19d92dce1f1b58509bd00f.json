He has been a reporter on the BBC's Newsnight and Panorama programmes, Political Editor of the Observer, and a columnist on The Sunday Times. He is the author of five non-fiction books in addition to his bestselling fiction.\n\n\n\nFatherland (1992):\nUnveils the living nightmare of a world planned by the Nazis in reality, but never achieved. It illuminates the trail taken by the loner March, leading him to the discoveries of wartime corruption, Swiss bank vaults, love, danger, and - most terrifying of all - the black heart of the Nazi state.\n\nEnigma (1995):\nSteeped in the atmosphere of wartime England, based around an actual event, Enigma is a thriller of genius: It is March 1943 and the War hangs in the balance . . . At Bletchley Park Tom Jericho, a brilliant young codebreaker, is facing a double nightmare. The Germans have unaccountably changed their U-boat Enigma code, threatening a massive Allied defeat. As suspicion grows that there may be a spy inside Bletchley, and Jericho is suspected, his girlfriend, the beautiful and mysterious Claire Romilly, suddenly disappears. With the help of Claire's best friend, Hester, Jericho sets out to find Claire, clear his name and unmask the spy. The answers will change his life forever...\n\nPompeii (2003):\nEngineer Marcus Attilius Primus has taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct which brings water to a quarter of a million people. His predecessor has disappeared. When a crisis strikes the Augusta's main line, Attilus discovers that there are forces which even the Roman Empire can't control.\n\nImperium (First book in the Cicero series) (2006):\nOf all the great figures of Roman times, none was more fascinating or attractive than Marcus Cicero. A brilliant lawyer and orator, a famous wit and philosopher, he launched himself at the age of twenty-seven into the violent, treacherous world of Roman politics. Cicero was determined to attain imperium, the supreme power in the state. Beside him at all times in his struggle to reach the top ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the office of Consul ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was his confidential secretary, Tiro. An accomplished man, Tiro was the inventor of shorthand and the author of numerous books, including a famous life of Cicero, unfortunately lost in the Dark Ages.\nIn Imperium, Robert Harris recreates Tiro's vanished masterpiece, recounting in vivid detail the story of Cicero's rise to power, from radical young lawyer to first citizen of Rome, competing with men such as Pompey, Caesar, Crassus and Cato.\n\nThe Ghost (2007):\nAfter five books set firmly in the past, Robert Harris returns with a contemporary novel that brings the reader face to face with some of the biggest issues of our time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the result is a gripping and genuinely thrilling read about a former British Labour prime minister, out of the job for a year or so and now accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe Fear Index (2011): A chilling contemporary thriller from Robert Harris set in the competitive world of high finance.\n\nDr Max Hoffman is a legend. A physicist once employed on the Large Hadron Collider, he now uses a revolutionary and highly secret system of computer algorithms to trade on the world's financial markets. None of his rivals is sure how he does it, but somehow Hoffman's hedge fund -- built around the standard measure of market volatility: the VIX or &quot;Fear Index&quot; -- generates astonishing returns for his investors.\n\nLate one night, in his house beside Lake Geneva, an intruder disturbs Hoffman and his wife while they are asleep. This terrifying moment is the start of Robert Harris's new novel -- a story just as compelling and timely as his most recent contemporary thriller, The Ghost. Over the next 48 hours, as the markets edge towards another great crash, Hoffman's world disintegrates. But who is trying to destroy him?\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32aa11a9280ea82fde19d92dce1f1b58509bd00f","amp;dn":"The+Robert+Harris+Ebook+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32aa11a9280ea82fde19d92dce1f1b58509bd00f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,170,17,169,40,14,168,47,222,25,217,45,206,31,27,88,80,155,208,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
