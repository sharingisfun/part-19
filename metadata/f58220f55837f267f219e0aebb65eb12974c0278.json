During that one year he made fifteen films, earned an unprecedented salary and established himself as a firm box-office favourite. Unlike other artists, Chaplin had full control over his Essanay films from writing the scripts and directing, through to choosing his cast members. Audiences around the world clamoured to see his latest Essanay picture.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 in East Street, Walworth, South London, and from extremely humble origins (part of his childhood was spent in homes for destitute children) he rose to become one of the most extraordinary and enduring icons of the cinema, whose power to move audiences is undiminished. In Britain, Chaplin's critical reputation suffered a period of eclipse from the 1960s, in reaction to the high regard in which he was held by public and critics alike at the peak of his career. Now the BFI is leading a major revaluation of his life and achievements.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard01-48.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard01-48.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard05-33.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard05-33.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard02-47.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard02-47.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard03-45.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1022.photobucket.com/albums/af341/bubble_belly/Clipboard03-45.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nList of titles (each with IMDB entry):\n\nVol. 1\n\n* His New Job\n* A Night Out\n* The Champion\n* In the Park\n* A Jitney Elopement\n* The Tramp\n* By the Sea\n* Work\n\nVol. 2\n\n* A Woman\n* The Bank\n* Shanghaied\n* His Regeneration\n* A Night in the Show\n* Charlie Chaplin's Burlesque on Carmen\n* Police!\n* Triple Trouble: An Essanay Collage\n\n--------my rips--------\n\n(all similar, 16 to 18 FPS)\n\n~~~~~~ Work.avi ~~~~~~\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................330,493,952\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................20:10.716\nFrame Count:....................................20582\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333\nFrames Per Second:..............................17.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1370\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.262&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR\nAudio Channel Count:............................2 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
