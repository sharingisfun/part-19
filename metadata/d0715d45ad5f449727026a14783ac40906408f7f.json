From the modern frenetic intensity of &quot;A MhuirnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“&quot;, to the peace of &quot;Coinleach Glas An FhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³mhair&quot;, there really is something for everyone here.\nMost of the music here is from Clannad's later, more &quot;modern&quot; releases. If you've found Clannad from the &quot;new age&quot; and modern element, this CD will most probably be to your liking thanks to tracks such as &quot;A MhuirnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“&quot; and &quot;ThiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡'n ChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³sta&quot;, the latter with a subtle, bluesy intensity which makes it intensely memorable. Fans of the Celtic element need not be disappointed either, with &quot;Buachaill On Eirne&quot; and &quot;Alasdair MacColla&quot; providing a well-needed balance.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Theme From Harry's Game\n[02] CroÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ga\n[03] A Mhuirnin O\n[04] Seanchas\n[05] Caislean Oir\n[06] Robin (The Hooded Man)\n[07] Ri Na Cruinne\n[08] Na Laethe Bhi\n[09] Ca De Din Do'n Te Sin\n[10] Alasdair MacColla\n[11] Atlantic Realm\n[12] Thios Fa'n Chosta\n[13] Buachaill An Eirne\n[14] Banba Oir\n[15] Coinleach Ghlas An FhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³mhair\n[16] The Fairy Queen\n \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:01m:20s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 150mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes 8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Celtic Folk Instrumental\n\nOriginally Released\t- 01 October 1999\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Camden BMG\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.clannad.ie \n\n \n\n\n\n\n* * * PLEASE SEED TO A RATIO OF 1:1 OR GREATER * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LL ONLY RE-SEED IF THERE IS MORE THAN 10 PEERS WAITING * * *\n\n* * * ANY PROBLEMS - LEAVE COMMENTS ON MY MOST RECENT TORRENTS  - TOO MANY PAGES TO CHECK * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0715d45ad5f449727026a14783ac40906408f7f","amp;dn":"%5B1999%5D+Celtic+Collection+-+Clannad+-+150mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0715d45ad5f449727026a14783ac40906408f7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,113,93,69,173,95,68,151,39,2,106,20,120,58,196,9,6,64,143,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
