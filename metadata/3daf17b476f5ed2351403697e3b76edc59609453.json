It will be released on November 25, 2013 through Reprise Records.\n\nForeverly is a collection of traditional songs, and is a reinterpretation of the 1958 album Songs Our Daddy Taught Us by The Everly Brothers. It is promoted by the lead single &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;. A lyric video for the song was released on November 13, 2013, and was followed by the release of a music video for &quot;Silver Haired Daddy of Mine&quot; five days later.\n\nIn the studio, Jones and Armstrong were joined by bassist Tim Luntzel and drummer Dan Rieser. The recording started with the first song off Songs Our Daddy Taught Us because they &quot;didn't know where else to begin.&quot; Asked about singing harmonies together with Armstrong, Jones said: &quot;I feel like on the first song it started coming together. But it definitely took a minute to get super, super comfortable. But then after hearing what the first song sounded like I thought, 'Oh! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna be great, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna be fine.'&quot;\n\nThe songs were initially recorded during a five-day session, except for one track that Armstrong and Jones forgot about. After a few weeks the musicians met for another session to record it, and to put the finishing touches on the other tracks. &quot;Personally, I really enjoy doing records in two sessions so you have some room to see how you feel about everything. It was nice to go back and have some room to just kinda re-record a couple of songs that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d done in the beginning. We figured out which way the record was going at that point and what was missing and so when we re-did those songs we put in what was missing. We just hit it a little harder. I like doing it in two sessions like that,&quot; said Norah Jones.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TCEmXmP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TCEmXmP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3daf17b476f5ed2351403697e3b76edc59609453","amp;dn":"Billie+Joe+Armstrong+%26amp%3B+Norah+Jones+-+Foreverly+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3daf17b476f5ed2351403697e3b76edc59609453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,175,23,180,118,245,237,35,81,64,54,151,227,183,110,220,89,96,148,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
