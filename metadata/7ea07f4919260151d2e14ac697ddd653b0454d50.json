Within each volume, titles are arranged alphabetically, and entries include brief publishing information, a summary of the book's content, a censorship history, and a short list of further reading. Some 50 entries are new. The political volume has added 10 entries, among them Ha Jin's 1999 novel Waiting, denounced in China for portraying Chinese people as backward; the Chinese publication was canceled. The volume on religious grounds now has entries for five Harry Potter books. Fourteen entries, including one for Sari Says, an advice book for teens, have been added to the sexual grounds volume. Another 14 entries have been added to the social grounds volume, among them Marion Dane Bauer's Am I Blue? and Francesca Lia Block's Baby Be-Bop. Each volume in the set concludes with short author profiles, a bibliography, and a list of books discussed in the other volumes. \n\n\n# Publisher: Facts on File; 2 Revised edition (August 2006)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0816062706\n# ISBN-13: 978-0816062706","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea07f4919260151d2e14ac697ddd653b0454d50","amp;dn":"Literature+Suppressed+Banned+Books%284+Vols%29+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea07f4919260151d2e14ac697ddd653b0454d50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,160,127,73,25,38,1,81,210,225,74,198,151,221,214,83,176,69,77,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
