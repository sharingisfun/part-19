The 1st one had a weird aspect ratio and played back in 4:3 ratio so everything was tall and skinny. I've modified this so it plays back properly in 16:9 ratio. The 2nd and 3rd files are unmodified so if you already have these you can just rename them and put them in this download directory.\n\nEpisodes 4 to 9 were the 2.2gb rips uploaded by Poepzooi, some of them from here and the rest from other sites. I've re-encoded them all to 700mb rips to create a more reasonable file size without undue loss of quality. I hope I've done a decent job. All files have been checked for audio sync and everything looks good.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662fde2d326520fd15a6729bcd051862118f43f7","amp;dn":"Catching+The+Impossible+-+All+9+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662fde2d326520fd15a6729bcd051862118f43f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,47,222,45,50,101,32,253,21,166,114,155,205,5,24,98,17,143,67,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
