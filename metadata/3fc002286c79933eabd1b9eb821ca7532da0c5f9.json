All he knows is that he has to get out, away from the drugs being pumped into him and back to the real world to search for answers. His first question: How did his friend TonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s internal organs fill with sand, killing him in a Las Vegas car crash?\n\nAfter a narrow escape, he tracks down the basic facts: he is an investigator and blogger specializing in the supernaturalÃ¢â‚¬â€which is a good thing, because QuentinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is getting stranger by the minute. It seems he is one of a special breed, a person with unusual powers. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the prime suspect in a string of murders linked by a series of seemingly mundane objects. The deeper he digs and the harder he works to clear his name, the more Quentin realizes that some truths are better off staying buriedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc002286c79933eabd1b9eb821ca7532da0c5f9","amp;dn":"Technomancer+-+B.+V.+Larson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc002286c79933eabd1b9eb821ca7532da0c5f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,192,2,40,108,121,147,62,171,209,185,235,130,28,167,83,45,160,197,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
