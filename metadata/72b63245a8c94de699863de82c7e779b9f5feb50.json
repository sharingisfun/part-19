But what exactly is a &quot;natural wine&quot;? For this pioneering book, best-selling wine writer Jamie Goode has teamed up with winemaker and Master of Wine Sam Harrop to explore the wide range of issues surrounding authenticity in wine. They begin by emphasizing that wine's diversity, one of its strengths, is currently under threat from increasingly homogenized commercial wines that lack a sense of place. Drawing on a global array of examples and anecdotes, Goode and Harrop examine complex concepts--terroir, biodynamics, and sustainability--in clear language. They also discuss topics including cultured and wild yeasts, wine &quot;faults,&quot; the carbon footprint of the wine industry, &quot;natural&quot; as a marketing concept, and more. Authentic Wine illuminates a subject of great interest to wine producers, consumers, and anyone wondering where the wine industry is headed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72b63245a8c94de699863de82c7e779b9f5feb50","amp;dn":"Authentic+Wine%3A+Toward+Natural+and+Sustainable+Winemaking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72b63245a8c94de699863de82c7e779b9f5feb50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,182,50,69,168,201,77,230,153,134,61,232,44,126,119,155,159,95,235,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
