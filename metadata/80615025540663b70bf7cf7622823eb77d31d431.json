Field Productions has gathered skiers with all different backgrounds , but they all share the same vision about skiing. Yes, skiing is about taking risks to invent new tricks and styles, but most importantly to have fun. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Eyes Wide OpenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gives you both. The movie includes top notch skiing in deep powder, big mountains, city streets and terrain parks featuring many of the most talented athletes out there. Look out for many unseen rail combos by Tom Wallisch and Even Sigstad, bottomless powder at Mica Heli Guides with ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦smund Thorsen and Eric Hjorleifson, Aksel Lund Svindal in Adamants BC, Jon Olsson attending epic park heli shoots on the most beatiful places in Norway, JT Holmes and Eirk Finseth charging Lake Tahoe, Norwegian invasion in Montafon Austria and much, much more. Some parts of the movie is filmed with the RED One camera, which gives ski movies a whole new meaning. \n\n\n\nPartners\n\nMain partners:\n\nSweet protection\n\t\nFri Flyt\n\t\nDiscovery Channel\n\t\nSkiinfo\n\n\nPartners:\n\n\nPeak Performance\n\n\t\n\nK2 Skis\n\n\t\n\nBergans\n\n\t\n\nTrysil\n\n\n\nMedia partners:\n\n\nNewschoolers\n\t\n\nSBC Skier\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nINFO:\n\n\n\nYear: 2009\n\nResolution: 720x480\n\nFrame Rate: 25 frames per second\n\nRuntime: 45min 26seconds\n\nSize: 679mt\n\nFormat: AVI\n\nBit Rate: 4397kbps\n\n\n\nAudio Channels: 2 channels\n\nAudio Bit Rate: 192kbps\n\nAudio Sampling Rate: 44kHz\n\n\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY!\t\t\n\n\n\nANOTHER SKI MOVIES:\n\n\nRevolver by PBP \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6084081/(Ski_Movie_2011)_Revolver_by_PoorBoyz_Productions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6084081/(Ski_Movie_2011)_Revolver_by_PoorBoyz_Productions&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEye Trip by Level 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6014672/(Ski_Movie_2011)_Eye_Trip_by_Level_1_Productions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6014672/(Ski_Movie_2011)_Eye_Trip_by_Level_1_Productions&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80615025540663b70bf7cf7622823eb77d31d431","amp;dn":"%28Ski+Movie+2010%29+Eyes+Wide+Open+by+Field+Productions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80615025540663b70bf7cf7622823eb77d31d431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,97,80,37,84,6,99,183,11,247,207,118,34,130,62,183,125,49,212,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
