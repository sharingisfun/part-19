Conor spends his days studying the science of flight with his tutor and exploring the castle with the kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, Princess Isabella. But the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s idyllic life changes forever the day he discovers a deadly conspiracy against the king. When Conor tries to intervene, he is branded a traitor and thrown into jail on the prison island of Little Saltee. There, he has to fight for his life, as he and the other prisoners are forced to mine for diamonds in inhumane conditions.\n\nThere is only one way to escape Little Saltee, and that is to fly. So Conor passes the solitary months by scratching drawings of flying machines on the prison walls. The months turn into years; but eventually the day comes when Conor must find the courage to trust his revolutionary designs and take to the air.\n\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Fantasy | Science Fiction | Adventure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b65c81370377ccb048f44a4950b0063d93f96af0","amp;dn":"Airman+-+Eoin+Colfer+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b65c81370377ccb048f44a4950b0063d93f96af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,92,129,55,3,119,204,176,72,244,74,73,80,176,6,61,147,249,106,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
