The time between the two major releases was a troubled time for the band internally. There were several changes of members and also trouble with the major label as they were shunted from Rocket/Island to Rocket/A&amp;M then back to Rocket/Island and after the sale of Polygram to Universal Music Group, they were moved onto Island Defjam. &quot;Do Right&quot; and &quot;Trash&quot; were both singles released from B.Y.O.S. &quot;Do Right&quot; was the first single released and the only JCS music video to make it onto MTV's Total Request Live with Carson Daly. &quot;Trash&quot; never received much airplay, mainly due to lack of support by the record label.\n\nWith early releases of B.Y.O.S, there was a card to mail to Fowl Records for a free copy of the Slow Change EP. This EP is rare, but can still be occasionally found.\n\nThe tour for this album included dates playing with bands such as Creed, Fuel, Finger Eleven, and Joydrop.\n\n# 1\n# Spiraling\n# 3:45\n#\n\n# 2\n# Lazy Boy Dash\n# 3:13\n#\n\n# 3\n# Do Right\n# 3:02\n#\n\n# 4\n# String of Pearls\n# 3:55\n#\n\n# 5\n# Ooh\n# 3:04\n#\n\n# 6\n# Let's Get Flat\n# 3:38\n#\n\n# 7\n# Trash\n# 3:08\n#\n\n# 8\n# Fill in the Blank\n# 3:20\n#\n\n# 9\n# Face It\n# 3:20\n#\n\n# 10\n# Silence Again\n# 2:59\n#\n\n# 11\n# Pure\n# 4:29\n#\n\n# 12\n# Waiting\n# 4:04\n#\n\n# 13\n# 30 Days\n# 3:57\n#\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bcdb9e8b7380e9c73d5a872a7e6893c368950ef","amp;dn":"Jimmie%5C%27s+Chicken+Shack+-+Bring+Your+Own+Stereo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bcdb9e8b7380e9c73d5a872a7e6893c368950ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,205,185,232,183,56,14,156,115,213,168,114,167,230,137,60,54,137,80,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
