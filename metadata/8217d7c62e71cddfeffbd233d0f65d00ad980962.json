And the three vocal cuts -- &quot;Summertime,&quot; &quot;A Foggy Day,&quot; &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; -- foretell Benson's well-deserved success as an R&amp;B and pop singer. \nLonnie Smith's organ and Ronnie Cuber's baritone sax provide the group with an unmistakable signature sound, perhaps dated at first blush, but timeless in actuality.
