rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_from_Shantung&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA much lauded and analyzed top ten hit, it made superstars of its lead and director. They packed blood-soaked symbolism and dramatic power into the tragic tale of &quot;Ma Yung Cheng&quot; (also the film's Chinese title), who becomes the first Chinese to defeat a professional Russian wrestler, only to find fame more dangerous than he ever imagined.\n Internationally famous director John Woo served as assistant director on the production and now openly acknowledges its influence. \n\nBoxer From Shantung transcends the typical &quot;rags to riches&quot; story. First, I will get to the few negatives of the story.\n\nChen Kuan Tai(Plays as Ma Yung Chen) takes interest in a singer at a local restaurant. While it is creative the way they showcase what becomes a mutual interest, I would have like to have seen just a bit more about it.\n\nOne more fight scene with David Chiang(Plays as Teng if I pronounced that correctly) would have worked out for me. He really is not present much in the movie. He has a good role in the storyline, but at the sacrifice of being behind the scenes more often.\n\nNow the positives:\n1. Great casting. Everyone seems just right in the place that they are. If you are familiar with Ku Feng, he is right at home with his more than usual hot head villain role(He does not play a good guy nearly as much).\n If you are familiar with Cheng Kang Yeh(Five tough guys, Duel of the iron fists, Snake Deadly Act) He is his usual poor self(He is usually a poor man willing to do anything for money or a hustling poor man willing to do anything for money). Chen Kuan Tai is also right at home at the confident, cocky at times, nobody who won't take anyone's help on his way to the top.\n\nThe Fight Scenes: Well choreographed and well placed within the movie. There is not a fight scene thrown in just because it is a Martial Arts movie. Every fight scene falls right into place with the storyline and is timed very well.\n\nThe Storyline: It is not your A-typical rags to riches. Chen Kuan Tai has to make alot of difficult decisions throughout the movie that impact his new wealth. Once more, it is not so easily kept.\n\nThis is a great all around movie that could easily transcend a fighting movie, because the storyline is so well put together. A must have for any Classic or new Martial Arts film collector!! \n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Dec%202014/TheBoxerFromShantung1972x264DVDripShawBrosKungFump4_thumbs_20141220_015444_zps9df84fb1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Dec%202014/TheBoxerFromShantung1972x264DVDripShawBrosKungFump4_thumbs_20141220_015444_zps9df84fb1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis was personally encoded by me, Carjacker, from the Retail Edition DVD.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
