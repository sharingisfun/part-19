American Sunshine  \n\nWhile Colin HayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice and visage are familiar to millions as front-man, songwriter, and vocalist of pop sensations Men at Work (Down Under, Overkill, Who Can It Be Now?), the past ten years have found him quietly re-introducing himself to a new generation of fans. The frequent uses of his music on soundtracksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ including the hit NBC show Scrubs (on which he has also had several cameos) and the sleeper-hit soundtrack to the film Garden StateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½have proven the timeless appeal of his songs: quizzical, curious, cynical yet open-hearted. \n\nAmerican Sunshine is a multifaceted portrait of Colin Hay the performer, songwriter, and recording artist. Within its eleven tracks are some of the heftiest rock, purest pop, and most emotionally bare acoustic balladry Hay has yet laid down, all guided by his uncluttered songwriting and his instantly recognizable voice. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy last record [2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Are You LookinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ At Me?] was the first new album IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d done in a long time,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he explains. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn a way, it felt like my first solo album. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m still learning, and I learned a lot on that record. This one is definitely a step up in terms of the quality of the songs and the sounds we captured.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Combine that with his tireless touring and Hay is poised to enter a new phase in his already storied career. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/04/11/colin-hay/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/04/11/colin-hay/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f8ea6a78d57613df90eda6ac238d48f59d21661","amp;dn":"Colin+Hay...American+Sunshine%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f8ea6a78d57613df90eda6ac238d48f59d21661","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,142,166,167,141,87,97,61,249,14,218,106,194,56,212,143,89,210,22,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
