Enjoy it guys. :)\n\nThis is the sleek, new Epic Victory private VLJ business jet by Epic Aircraft in the United States. This unique, small 5 passenger jet features a single engine turbine powerplant, high mileage economy, and fast cruise at 320 Knots. The Victory features the Garmin G1000 full screen panel system and a plush, luxurious, leather clad interior. Featuring an all carbon fiber airframe, this is one very liteweight, very fast, very economical jet for todays jetset pilots. This Addon Package is by permission of Epic Aircraft Corporation.\n\nThere are presently 12 different exterior paint schemes that the Epic Victory comes with. Each exterior paint scheme has a fitting interior and panel theme that will match it. Paint schemes mostly feature metal flake metallic finishes with a classy, waxed shine.\n\nPanel\n\nThe instrument panels feature the Garmin G1000 glass panel system as well as the MVP-50 engine management screen, lower center. There are 5 different color schemes of instrument panels to accompany the 12 variant interior/exterior themes. These panel versions include dove gray metal, carbon fiber, cherry wood veneer, teak wood veneer, and walnut burl veneer. The center screen now features a built in Checklist system like the actual Garmin screens. The MVP-50 features a secondary screen showing the aircraft outline and system features/annunciations.\n\nThe instrumentation feature soft glow, high realism illumination for night flying 'without' the dome lights being on. This enhances the night flying visuals. Control yokes are hide-able for being able to see switches and controls that might be 'behind' the yokes. All primary instrumentation units (PFD, MFD, MVP-50, Auto Pilot) have Maximize Popup modes for better visibility.\n\nThe Epic Victory comes with a 2D panel set, one gray and one wood. These are also duplicated into Wide Screen versions which you can add to your planes if you have a wide screen monitor. One simply adds in 'ws' to the 'panel' line of each aircraft Registry block in the 'aircraft.cfg' file of the Victory to set all 2D panels to wide screen visual modes.\n\nInterior\n\nThere are many variants of interiors featured which include grays, mustard yellows, blues, and burgandy. Each interior theme is coupled with a panel color theme as well, which as mentioned above consist of 5 different panel variations of themes. Some features of the rear cabin interior are a fold out table that deploys when the landing gear are raised. An Apple iPad tablet media computer sits on the mid-ship passenger seat. The iPad will fly over to the table top when the table deploys during flight, as seen in the screenshots below.\n\nThe interior, such as the seats and the interior sides of the cabin walls 'illuminate' with a soft glow when the 'instrumentation lights' are on, (after the sun fully sets in Flight Simulator). A seperate switch on the instrument panel turns on the rear cabin dome lights (2) for 'bright' illumination. Thust there are 2 modes of rear cabin lighting. This also goes for the front cockpit area, having a seperate dome light for the front, as well as the rear cabin.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nSpecial Features are the 'extra's that the package features. In the Victory, you will find that there are a few. There is a 'Park Mode' which has deployed wheel chocks, turbine inlet cover, and pitot flags. The co-pilot female can be unhidden. There is a removeable nose cowling door which when animated away shows the detailed nose compartment with batteries, hydraulic system, electrics boxes, GPS antennae arrays, and several other systems. In the rear, the turbine engine access cowling is also removeable and shows you the tight fit of the Pratt and Whitney jet. Another feature is the baggage which is unloaded to the pavement via a command.\n\nIn the center top screenshot below, you can see the 'Remote Command Console' popup panel. This manages your Special Features, such as front and rear cowlings animations, unhide copilot, etc. This also includes Map view mode, and will call a fueling truck to your jet if the airport fascilities you are parked at have one. The Remote Command console also features night mode (blue lighting) and has sound tone buttons. Yellow illuminations on the RCC Annunciators specify 'non-flight' conditions, while green is 'ok in flight mode annunciator callouts.\n\nSpecs\n\n \n\n    * Seats......................5\n    * Construction...........Carbon fiber\n    * Pressurization.........6.5\n    * Engine...................Pratt &amp; Whitney PW600 series\n    * Dimensions\n    * Length..................33.4 ft.\n    * Wingspan.............36.3 ft.\n    * Height..................10.7 ft.\n    * Cabin length.........14.5 ft.\n    * Cabin width..........4.7 ft.\n    * Cabin height..........4.4 ft.\n    * Weights Empty weight.................   . 2,700 lbs.\n    * Maximum take-off weight.................5,500 lbs.\n    * Maximum payload with full fuel............900 lbs.\n    * Performance Maximum cruise.........  .......320\n    * KTAS Economy cruise...........................250\n    * KTAS Stall Clean.....................................84\n    * KTAS Stall Full Flaps...............................74\n    * KTAS Ceiling.................................28,000 ft.\n    * Time to climb..................................28,000 ft., 10 min.\n    * Range economy cruise (with reserve and with full passengers)..................1200 NM\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb16be3eba67954f9914d347e210e965d655c4a6","amp;dn":"FSX+Lionheart+-+Epic+Victory+Vlj","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb16be3eba67954f9914d347e210e965d655c4a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,22,190,62,186,103,149,79,153,20,211,71,226,16,233,101,214,85,196,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
