This action is commonly seen as the start of the dispute that would subsequently see the band leave the label.[citation needed]\nThe band remained with Echo for their third LP, Gods and Monsters (2005), but left the label citing a lack of financial support after another planned single, &quot;I Believe&quot;, was cancelled at short notice. Later that year they issued a limited edition single entitled &quot;Maybe I Should&quot; on November 21, following some of their biggest headlining concerts in the UK, culminating in a show at the London Astoria.\nIn April 2006 &quot;Only Role in Town&quot;, was made available for free download, followed by the release of an album of BBC Radio One DJ John Peel session tracks in October 2006, recorded over two sessions in 2001 and 2004.\nI Am Kloot's fourth studio album, I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge, was available at gigs in November 2007 as a limited edition of 2000 copies, before going on general release on 14 April 2008.\nIn October 2009, they released a double album compilation of B-sides, rarities and unreleased songs collected under the title of B.\nI Am Kloot's next studio album, Sky at Night, was released on 5 July 2010 through Shepherd Moon Records. The album was produced by Craig Potter and Guy Garvey from Elbow.\nThe Sky at Night album was shortlisted for the 2010 Barclaycard Mercury Music Prize.\nThe sixth studio album, titled Let It All In, was released on 21 January 2013.\n\n\nCountry: England (Manchester)\nGenre: Indie Folk / Alternative Rock\nQuality: FLAC / 320 kbps\nAlbum List:\n(2001) I Am Kloot - Natural History [FLAC (tracks+.cue) lossless]\n(2003) I Am Kloot - I Am Kloot [FLAC (image + .cue), lossless]\n(2005) I Am Kloot - Gods and Monsters [FLAC (image + .cue), lossless]\n(2006) I Am Kloot - BBC Radio 1 John Peel Sessions [320 kbps]\n(2007) I Am Kloot - I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge [320 kbps]\n(2010) I Am Kloot - Sky At Night [FLAC (tracks+.cue) lossless]\n(2013) I Am Kloot - Let It All In [FLAC (tracks+.cue) lossless]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f249d5bda7e3514d1a86e82dc8fab8a1a6eec26a","amp;dn":"I+Am+Kloot+Discography+%5BFLAC%5D%2B%5B320+kbps+mp3%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f249d5bda7e3514d1a86e82dc8fab8a1a6eec26a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,73,213,189,167,227,81,77,26,134,232,45,200,250,184,161,166,238,194,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
