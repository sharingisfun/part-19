Saved was the second album of Dylan's &quot;Christian trilogy&quot;, following his conversion to born-again Christianity. It expanded on themes explored on its predecessor Slow Train Coming, with gospel arrangements and lyrics extolling the importance of a strong personal faith. The album hit No. 3 on the UK charts, reached No. 24 on the US charts and did not go gold. CCM Magazine described the album as an &quot;open declaration of Dylan's deepening faith.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;A Satisfied Mind&quot; (Red Hayes, Jack Rhodes) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:57\n    &quot;Saved&quot; (Tim Drummond, Dylan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:00\n    &quot;Covenant Woman&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:02\n    &quot;What Can I Do for You?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:54\n    &quot;Solid Rock&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:55\n    &quot;Pressing On&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:11\n    &quot;In the Garden&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:58\n    &quot;Saving Grace&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:01\n    &quot;Are You Ready&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:41","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77753c3cf6845ffcb534fcf534e928b325dc4783","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Saved+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77753c3cf6845ffcb534fcf534e928b325dc4783","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,117,60,60,246,132,95,252,181,52,252,245,52,233,40,179,37,220,71,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
