During his career, Vandross sold over twenty-five million albums and won eight Grammy Awards including Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance four times. He won four Grammy Awards in 2004 including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for the track &quot;Dance with My Father&quot;, co-written with Richard Marx.\n\nThe 1989 compilation The Best of Luther Vandross... The Best of Love, included the ballad &quot;Here and Now&quot;, his first single to chart in the Billboard pop chart top ten, peaking at number six. He won his first Grammy award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance in 1991.\n\nMore albums followed in the 1990s, beginning with 1991's Power of Love which spawned two top ten pop hits. He won his second Best Male R&amp;B Vocal in the Grammy Awards of 1992 with the track &quot;Power of Love/Love Power&quot; winning the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song in the same year. In 1992, &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot;, a duet with Janet Jackson from the movie Mo' Money became a hit.\n\nIn 1993, Vandross had a brief non-speaking role in the Robert Townsend movie The Meteor Man.
