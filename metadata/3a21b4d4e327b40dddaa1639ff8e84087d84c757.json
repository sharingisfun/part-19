When Britain Ruled the Skies\n\nTechnology Documentary hosted by Barbara Flynn, published by BBC in 2012 - English narration\n\n\nInformation\n------------------------------\n\nJet! When Britain Ruled the Skies\nSeries which celebrates an unlikely story of outstanding British aviation achievement at a time of national austerity, the breathtaking planes that were built and the remarkable men who flew them\n\n\n\n2)  The Shape of Things to Come \nIn the heady years following World War Two, Britain was a nation in love with aviation. Having developed the jet engine in war-time, British engineers were now harnessing its power to propel the world's first passenger jets. By 1960 the UK's passenger airline industry was the largest in the world, with routes stretching to the furthest-flung remnants of Empire. And the aircraft carrying these New Elizabethans around the globe were also British - the Vickers Viscount, the Bristol Britannia and the world's first pure jet-liner, the sleek, silver De Havilland Comet, which could fly twice as high and twice as fast as its American competitors. It seemed the entire nation was reaching for the skies to create the shape of things to come for air travel worldwide. But would their reach exceed their grasp?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img846.imageshack.us/img846/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img846.imageshack.us/img846/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img253.imageshack.us/img253/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img253.imageshack.us/img253/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3479/jetwhenbritainruledtheso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3479/jetwhenbritainruledtheso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/6236/jetwhenbritainruledthes.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/5484/jetwhenbritainruledthesc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/5484/jetwhenbritainruledthesc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1629 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59\n * Number Of Parts: 2\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_industry_in_the_United_Kingdom&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_industry_in_the_United_Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a21b4d4e327b40dddaa1639ff8e84087d84c757","amp;dn":"BBC+Jet%21+When+Britain+Ruled+the+Skies+2of2+The+Shape+of+Things+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a21b4d4e327b40dddaa1639ff8e84087d84c757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,33,180,212,227,39,180,13,221,170,22,57,255,142,132,8,125,132,199,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
