By 1923 Bhimrao Ambedkar broke the taboo, won doctorates abroad and fought for the emancipation of his people. He drafted India's Constitution, led his followers to discard Hinduism for Buddhism. His legend still spreads through poetry and song.\n\nIn 1997 a statue of Dr. Ambedkar in a Dalit colony in Mumbai was desecrated with footwear. As angry residents gathered, police opened fire killing 10. Vilas Ghogre, a leftist poet, hung himself in protest.\n'Jai Bhim Comrade' shot over 14 years, follows the poetry and music of people like Vilas and marks a subaltern tradition of reason that from the days of the Buddha, has fought superstition and religious bigotry.\n\n\nAWARDS\n\nBest Film, Films South Asia, Kathmandu, Nepal\nBest Film, Mumbai International Film Festival\nBest Documentary, Hong Kong International Film Festival\nBartok Prize, Jean Rouch International Film Festival, Paris, France\nSpecial Jury Award, National Awards, India\n\n\n-------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5c8bdaf995158050bb9433312aab756ca76c12","amp;dn":"Jai+Bhim+Comrade+-+Anand+Patwardhan+-+Excellent+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5c8bdaf995158050bb9433312aab756ca76c12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,92,139,218,249,149,21,128,80,187,148,51,49,42,171,117,108,167,108,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
