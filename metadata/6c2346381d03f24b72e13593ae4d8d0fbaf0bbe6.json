Tyler Miller, Richard Brewer, Scott Spoolman, &quot;Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions&quot;\nBrooks Cole | 2007 | ISBN: 0495385263 , 0495383376 | 576 pages | PDF | 30.20 MB\n\nEnvironmental issues affect every part of your life. ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE: WORKING WITH THE EARTH, Twelfth Edition, shows you how nature works, how we interact with it, and how we have sustained--and can continue to sustain--our relationship with the earth by applying nature's lessons to our economies and individual lifestyles. This central theme of sustainability--the ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions--is clarified by an emphasis on natural capital (resources) and degradation, solutions, trade-offs, and the importance of individuals. If you have little or no science background, the book provides you with a solid grounding in the basics that will help you better understand environmental science concepts. Case studies--on topics ranging from the importance of insects to the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone Park to the world of nanotechnology--illustrate key topics and issues that affect your life. These cases inspire How Would You Vote? questions, which sharpen your critical thinking by asking you to consider facts, conflicting solutions, and trade-offs surrounding the issues, and then cast your vote.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c2346381d03f24b72e13593ae4d8d0fbaf0bbe6","amp;dn":"Environmental+Science%3A+Problems%2C+Connections+and+Solutions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c2346381d03f24b72e13593ae4d8d0fbaf0bbe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,35,70,56,29,3,242,75,114,225,53,147,174,77,141,15,186,240,187,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
