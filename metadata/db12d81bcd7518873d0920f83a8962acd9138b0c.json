A feature of the Norfolk &amp; Western EMD SD45 are fully functioning dual controls, which allow the driver to operate the locomotive in either long hood direction or short hood direction. \n\nThe locomotives are also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Norfolk Southern SD45 High Hoods on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Horseshoe Curve route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\n\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nPlease use the email address for requests and questions and if you want to share an addon with the community then contact us and we will post it on your behalf.
