Macedonia seemed to have been spared the bloodletting. In reality, it was only postponed. The newly independent Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia remains a powder-keg waiting to explode.\n\nJournalist John Phillips describes the bloody rebellion initiated by Albanian guerrillas demanding rights equal to those of the dominant Slavs in Macedonia, a conflict that killed and wounded hundreds of people and set off fears that the crisis would draw in surrounding Kosovo, Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece. International intervention brought an uneasy halt to the bloodshed in the summer of 2001, but hardline Macedonian nationalistsÃ¢â‚¬â€including some under investigation by the international war crimes tribunalÃ¢â‚¬â€have hindered full implementation of the peace agreement and may renew their campaign.\n\nJohn Phillips has covered both the fighting on the front lines and the behind-the-scenes diplomatic intrigue in Macedonia.
