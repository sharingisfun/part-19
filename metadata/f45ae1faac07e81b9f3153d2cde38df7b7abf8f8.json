Tiger's Claw proves once again that every rave has been well deserved. Set in the near future, Tiger's Claw imagines a scenario in which tensions escalate between an economically powerful China and a United States weakened by a massive economic downfall, bringing the two superpowers to the brink of total destruction. Brown's popular protagonist, retired Air Force lieutenant-general Patrick McLanahan (of A Time for Patriots, Rogue Forces, and other Brown bestsellers), is back and preparing for the impending apocalyptic clash of men and military technology. The incomparable Dale Brown scores again with a frighteningly possible story of war and global politics that's ideal for fans of Vince Flynn and Brad Thor.\n\n\n                                  Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                                  Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n              **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n                  Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f45ae1faac07e81b9f3153d2cde38df7b7abf8f8","amp;dn":"Tiger%27s+Claw+by+Dale+Brown+%28Patrick+McLanahan+18%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f45ae1faac07e81b9f3153d2cde38df7b7abf8f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,90,225,250,172,7,232,27,159,49,83,210,205,227,141,247,183,171,248,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
