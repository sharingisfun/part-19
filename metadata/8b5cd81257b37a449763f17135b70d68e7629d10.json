The album contains 15 tracks all written by Malakian.\n\nOn what direction his album will take, Malakian states:\n     &quot;It will probably be something electronic mixed in with traditional Armenian and thrash, death, black, and doom metal influences. When, or even if, the music comes out, it will still be structured, just like System of a Down's music is.&quot;\n\nThis electronic idea was demonstrated in all 2005 concerts in which Malakian, instead of merely singing the chorus to the song &quot;Sugar&quot; or &quot;War?,&quot; as well as &quot;Old School Hollywood&quot; from Mezmerize, distorted his voice electronically with a Vocoder. Daron, in a recent interview, has said that the sound will be influenced by classic rock such as David Bowie, Brian Eno, Yes, Neil Young, and Roxy Music. Malakian has shifted his songwriting away from SOAD's frazzled metal to more song-based work. &quot;I don't feel we're the mosh-pit band,&quot; says Malakian. &quot;That's just where I'm comfortable as a writer right now.&quot;\n\nScars on Broadway began recording on September 27, 2007. For the recording of their debut album, the two will be &quot;accompanied by some great musicians.&quot;[2] On December 6th, 2007, the drum tracks for the album had been finished and the band moved into the next stage of recording. On July 25th, the band released a teaser for the album featuring the song &quot;Babylon&quot;\n\nThe band has released &quot;They Say&quot; as their first airplay single. It was accompanied by a video that was shot and released in late June.\n\nThe song &quot;Enemy&quot; contains a part of the System of a Down song &quot;Drugs&quot;, a live-only song that Daron would often play in between songs.\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  Scars On Broadway       \nAlbum     -  Scars On Broadway                                          \nGenre     -  Experimental rock                                         \nLabel     -  Interscope\nYear      -  2008                                            \nTracks    -  15                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  69 MB\nkbps      -  VBR / 192 or higher / 256 avg\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt;  \n                                         \nEnjoy.
