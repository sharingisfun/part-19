It is written in the voice of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, where the countries of North America once existed. The Capitol, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games are an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12Ã¢â‚¬â€œ18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death.\n\nThe Hunger Games trilogy is a series of young adult science-fiction adventure novels by Suzanne Collins. The trilogy consists of The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay. The first two books in the series were both New York Times best sellers, and Mockingjay topped all US bestseller lists upon its release. By the time the film adaptation of The Hunger Games was released in 2012, the publisher had reported over 26 million Hunger Games trilogy books in print, including movie tie-in books. The series recently ranked second, bested only by Harry Potter, in NPR's poll of the top 100 teen novels, which asked voters to choose their favorite young adult books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa04ff1495f6f339577943faf2ce216307a3a313","amp;dn":"The+Hunger+Games+Trilogy+-+Suzanne+Collins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa04ff1495f6f339577943faf2ce216307a3a313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,4,255,20,149,246,243,57,87,121,67,250,242,206,33,99,7,163,163,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
