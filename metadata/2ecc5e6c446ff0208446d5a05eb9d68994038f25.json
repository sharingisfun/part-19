A select few, such as Abe Epstein of San Antonio, Texas, used his income to feed a less common obsession: starting record labels. From the early '60s through the early '70s, Epstein founded a deluge of them. Not one of the bunch came close to rivaling Stax or Motown, but his Dynamic imprint -- supported by licensing to Columbia a Jox label single, Rene y Rene's 1964 single &quot;Angelito,&quot; which narrowly missed Billboard's Top 40 -- was productive enough to be anthologized by Numero. Active from 1965 through 1968, Dynamic was home to a Latino, black, and white mix of R&amp;B artists who churned out a considerable sum of decent-to-stellar material. The top highlight is the Commands' winsome 1966 A-side &quot;No Time for You,&quot; laced with undeniable background harmonies and exceptional instrumental support from Latino youngsters the Dell-Tones. It didn't become a big hit, but it went national; the O'Jays released a cover the same year on Imperial. Just beneath that, there's &quot;I Gotta Know,&quot; a peppy cult favorite of England's Northern soul community, from a group of young women dubbed the Tonettes. Dust collectors from flame throwers Bobby Blackmon &amp; the Soul Express, Naval buddies Doc &amp; Sal (whose &quot;Can't Get You Offa My Mind&quot; answered James &amp; Bobby Purify's &quot;I'm Your Puppet&quot;), the charmingly ragged Little Jr. Jesse &amp; the Tear Drops, the promising-sounding Don &amp; the Doves, and Galveston's storming Webs are also featured. In March 2013, when this typically generous and in-depth package was released, Numero planned other Epstein-related anthologies. Perhaps one of them will include &quot;Angelito,&quot; which was covered by Herb Alpert and quickly forgotten by the pop world.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Commands - Hey It's Love\n2.
