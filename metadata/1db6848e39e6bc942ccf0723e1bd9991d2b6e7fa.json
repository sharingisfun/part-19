Such is the provocative premise behind Dr. Steven Lamm's The Hardness Factor, a groundbreaking book that will change the way men live and love. The Hardness Factor measures male health through the quality of an erection -- perhaps the greatest male motivator for better living (more so than fear of cancer, heart attack, or stroke). The Hardness Factor asks, Can men be hard and in shape for sex their entire lives? The answer is, absolutely. Here for the first time are scientific, evidence-based regimens -- emphasizing nutrition, supplements, and exercise -- to increase erectile quality. By following the programs in The Hardness Factor, you will\n\n    improve overall health;\n    produce stronger, harder, and longer-lasting erections;\n    increase strength, fitness, flexibility, and vitality;\n    restore self-confidence; and\n    achieve maximum sexual gratification with your partner.\n\nA renowned New York clinician, bestselling author, and a favorite expert on the television show The View, Dr. Lamm offers straight talk for men of all ages in &quot;The Four-Day Insurance Policy,&quot; which can provide a quick fix for that upcoming Saturday night (or any other dating emergency), and the more detailed &quot;Six-Week Hardness Factor Program,&quot; which will improve a man's sex drive, stamina, hardness, and, most of all, health. This comprehensive guide also includes numerous recipes created by acclaimed chef Waldy Malouf, aimed at promoting nutritional health and jump-starting the libido.\n\nAfter following The Hardness Factor, you will not only achieve optimal health and sexual fitness but also understand why the penis is the best barometer of a man's health.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1db6848e39e6bc942ccf0723e1bd9991d2b6e7fa","amp;dn":"%5BSteven_Lamm%2C_Gerald_Secor_Couzens%5D_The_Hardness_Factor.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1db6848e39e6bc942ccf0723e1bd9991d2b6e7fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,182,132,142,57,230,188,148,44,207,7,35,225,189,153,145,210,182,231,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
