This is the story of that album, that time and that city, told\nprimarily by the seven individuals who wrote, produced and performed it.\nIt was a calculated and painstaking endeavour to produce surefire hits\nwhatever it took.\n\nThe film follows Debbie Harry and the rest of the Blondie crew as they head\ninto the studio to record their game-changing album with producer\nMike Chapman. It also features commentary from Harry herself about writing\nmusic, the media's focus on her appearance and lyrically inspirational\nex-boyfriends.\n\nIn 1978 the New York band Blondie had two punk albums behind them and were\nestablishing a name for themselves at the club CBGBs on New York's Lower\nEast Side. Then Chrysalis Records exec Terry Ellis saw them and spent a\nmassive $1m buying out their recording contract. He had to ensure that their\nnext album was a hit - there was no room for error. To do this he brought\nin maverick Australian record producer Mike Chapman, who already had a\nstring of hits under his belt. Mike's job was to turn this crew of New York\npunks into world stars - but did they have the popular songs which would\nappeal to a wider non-punk audience?\n\nAt a time when rich creativity and grinding poverty and drug abuse were hand\nin hand on the sidewalks of the Lower East Side, the music and lyrics of\nParallel Lines celebrated and captured this vibrant and edgy chemistry\nshooting the band to international stardom.\n\n\nFORMAT:.......................: MKV\nCODEC:........................: X264\nGENRE:........................: Music Video\nFILE SIZE:....................: 327 MiB\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*406=16:9\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\nAUDIO AAC: ...................: 128 Kbps\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\nRUNTIME:......................: 49mn 9s\nENCODER:......................: oneanight\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d64f2a7e5cad46e64d9c57f4ece43f90b9d6958","amp;dn":"Blondie%27s+New+York+and+the+Making+of+Parallel+Lines+x264+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d64f2a7e5cad46e64d9c57f4ece43f90b9d6958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,100,242,167,229,202,212,110,100,217,197,127,78,206,67,249,11,157,105,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
