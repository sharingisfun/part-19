Training includes how to release any hold, knockout your attacker (real knockouts are taught and demonstrated), defend yourself from rear attacks (chokes, bear hugs, etc.), handle yourself if you should be knocked to the ground (escape the mount and prevent it from occurring). Also, learn to defend and counter the most common and most powerful type of punch you are likey to encounter in a violent assault. These techniques are taught as if you had no prior training, but are equally valuable to the trained martial artist.\n\nBar Fight Self Defense Volume 2 for iPod: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4408102/Bar_Fight_Self_Defense_Volume_2_-_iPod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4408102/Bar_Fight_Self_Defense_Volume_2_-_iPod&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eba884dc3bd0d93e4237a146d5edf4ef43c8595e","amp;dn":"12+Shots+to+Escape+Any+Street+Fight+-+iPod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eba884dc3bd0d93e4237a146d5edf4ef43c8595e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,168,132,220,59,208,217,62,66,55,161,70,213,237,244,239,67,200,89,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
