Talent alone wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cut it. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re an artist, musician, writer or creator of sorts, to stand out in the world you must be unmistakable.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only option.\n\nTo create unmistakable work, you must take risks. You must cross lines, personal and professional. You must go to the point of a no return. On my 34th birthday, I asked myself a question. &quot;If this had been the last year of my life, would I have been ok with how I'd lived?&quot; When my answer was a resounding NO, I knew that something had to change.\n\nSo I started to write in a way that was more honest, more transparent and more vulnerable than I ever had. I committed career suicide, one Facebook status update at a time. And in that process I found my voice. This collection of essays is about that journey. I hope it inspires you to find that unmistakable artist in yourself.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Buisiness | Self Help","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eef7c8a1b5319f1b28a753b5762dcf5dfa1a1e5e","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Being+Unmistakable+by+Srinivas+Rao","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eef7c8a1b5319f1b28a753b5762dcf5dfa1a1e5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,247,200,161,181,49,159,27,40,167,83,181,118,45,207,93,250,26,30,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
