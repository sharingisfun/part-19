In order to create The West, the film crew traveled over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) via airplane, conducted 72 interviews, visited 74 archives and collections, and filmed more than 250 hours of footage. The film's production was funded by General Motors.\n\nEpisode 8: Ghost Dance (1887Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1893)\n\n\n\nAired, September 22nd 1996; Narrator Peter Coyote\n\n\n\nEpisode Eight covers the years 1887 to 1893 when the West was rapidly developing its industrial forces. The episode traces events from the Oklahoma Land Rush to the rise of mining towns such as Butte, Montana. It examines the displacement of the Native American people, and includes a segment on the horrific 1890 Battle of Wounded Knee. Ghost Dance takes its title from a ceremonial ritual that Native Americans performed during this period in hopes of restoring the lost era of the buffalo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c64cdec77e3224ec821505f5549333e125f6c33","amp;dn":"PBS+Ken+Burns+The+West+8of9+Ghost+Dance+1995+DVD+720p+Egilman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c64cdec77e3224ec821505f5549333e125f6c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,100,205,236,119,227,34,78,200,33,80,95,85,73,51,62,18,95,108,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
