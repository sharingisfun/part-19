He is known for his freestyle ability and claims to have been on 1000 mixtapes.\n\nLilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ FlipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career was launched when he released his first album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe LeprechaunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The album quickly gained national attention and spawned the hit single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Can Do ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The album sold over 100,000 copies regionally and gained attention from Def Jam South, A &amp; R, and well-known Houston rapper Scarface. He was briefly signed to Def Jam, but abruptly left the label a few years later after concerns about his financial earnings. He soon signed to Loud Records and began recording his first national debut album.\n\nWhile recording his album, he was apparently shot by unknown assailants in a drive-by shooting. He survived the attack and pressed on to finish the album. At the age of 20, LilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Flip released his sophomore album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUndaground LegendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, his first nationally released album, which included the hit single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Way We BallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a remix to his hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Can Do ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The album reached platinum status even though it didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get much promotion from Loud Records.\n\nLilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Flip recorded his third album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œU Gotta Feel MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on Sony Records. This album was more commercial and featured Ludacris, Three 6 Mafia, and others.\n\n\nTracks Featured:\n\n1.\tIntro Lil Flip feat.
