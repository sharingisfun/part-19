Undertaking commerce, even by an individual, can mean working globally through a welter of new media with opportunities of all kinds rapidly appearing. The boundaries, scope, content, structures, and processes of a business activity can morph into completely different ones in the course of a project. Contemporary businesses, and certainly future businesses, find it incumbent upon them to fit within the requirements of environmental and economic sustainability of the others who inhabit our world.\n\nWith more than 1,000 entries, the Encyclopedia of Business in Today's World is packed with essential and up-to-date information on the state of business in our world. Not only does it reflect where business is, it also conveys the trajectory of business farther into the 21st century. These four volumes provide clear overviews of the important business topics of our time, ranging from culture shock to currency hedging, political risk, offshoring, and transnational corporations. The wealth of topics represent an integrated vision by the editor of a perplexity of functions, technologies, and environmental factors.\n\nKey Features\n\n    * Provides insight into the development and current business situation globally through articles on many individual countries\n    * Examines the processes, responsibilities, and ethics of business in the global market\n    * Offers entries written by experts from diverse fields\n    * Includes an appendix that looks at World Trade Organization statistics\n    * Presents a vast range of topics, including key companies, business policies, regions, countries, dimensions of globalization, economic factors, international agreements, financial instruments, accounting regulations and approaches, theories, legislation, management practices and approaches, and much more\n\nKey Themes\n\n    * Competitive Forces\n    * Countries\n    * Corporate Profiles\n    * Cultural Environments\n    * Economics of International Business\n    * Economic Theories of International Business\n    * Ethics, Corruption, and Social Responsibility\n    * Export/Import Strategies\n    * Foreign Direct Investment\n    * Globalization and Society\n    * Human Resource Management\n    * International Accounting\n    * International Finance\n    * International Monetary System\n    * International Trade\n    * Legal and Labor Issues\n    * Management and Leadership\n    * Manufacturing and Operations\n    * Marketing\n    * Political Environments\n    * Regional Economic Integration\n    * Supranational and National Organizations\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Business in TodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s World serves as a general, nontechnical resource for students, professors, and librarians seeking to understand the development of business as practiced in the United States and internationally.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 2136 pages\n# Publisher: Sage Publications, Inc (June 12, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 141296427X\n# ISBN-13: 978-1412964272","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95114f4f026a61ba75bbcd4dec0da02cd7074104","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Business+in+Today%5C%27s+World+%284+Vols%29+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95114f4f026a61ba75bbcd4dec0da02cd7074104","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,17,79,79,2,106,97,186,117,187,205,77,236,13,160,44,215,7,65,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
