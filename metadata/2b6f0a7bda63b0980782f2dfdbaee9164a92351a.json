Pulling strings, he arranges to accompany NYPD Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), claiming he wants to study and use her as a personality basis for his next book series. But their personalities don't mesh -- Castle's fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants detective style greatly clashes with Beckett's more conservative and methodical approach to the crimes, but the new life that Castle has begun couldn't have been scripted better by himself.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219024/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219024/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo: x264 \nAudio: Nero AAC \nSize: ~130 MB files\nBitrate: ~450 \nResolution: ~624x352 \nContainer: MKV \nSource: HDTV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b6f0a7bda63b0980782f2dfdbaee9164a92351a","amp;dn":"Castle+-+Season+3+-+Small+Sized+MKV+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b6f0a7bda63b0980782f2dfdbaee9164a92351a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,111,10,123,218,99,176,152,7,130,242,223,219,174,233,22,74,146,53,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
