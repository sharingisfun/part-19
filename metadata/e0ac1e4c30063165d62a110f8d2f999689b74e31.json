In this atmosphere, pulling a job - or a bird - is practically a national duty. Robbery is considered by Croker and Bridger as a means to `help with the country's balance of payments'. The ultra-patriotic Mr Bridger (a splendidly aristocratic Noel Coward, his cell walls pasted with pictures of royalty) sees the job as much a matter of national pride, a means to demonstrate the efficiency of the British system of work, than a route to amass loot.\n\nFilename..: The.Italian.Job.1969.1080p.HDTV.x264-CtrlHD.mkv\nFilesize..: 7.94GB (8,533,223,497 bytes)\nDuration..: 1hr 35min\nVideo.....: X264 1920x816 (2.35:1) 25fps, 11500Kbps, 0.295bits/(pixel*frame)\nAudio.....: AC3 384Kbps 6 channel\nLanguage..: English only (no subtitles)\nFrom......: newsgroup alt.binaries.hdtv.x264\n\nDon't download this if your using FAT32.
