He has lived through the political oppression and intolerance of religion that defined Communist Czechoslovakia, and he draws from this experience to remind readers that not only does crisis lead to deeper understanding but also that any living religion is a changing religion. The central messages of Christianity have always seemed impossible, from peace and forgiveness in the face of a harsh world to love and self-sacrifice despite human selfishness to the victory of resurrection through the defeat of the cross. Acceptance of paradox therefore is the way forward, HalÃƒÂ­k explains. It is a difficult way that offers an unclear immediate future, but it is ultimately the only honest way.  \n\n\nFollow me on twitter: @livhre\nRequest books on twitter: @livhre\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c50d7a28a7a78b8f710980ed04f275725ef22c5","amp;dn":"Night+of+the+Confessor+-+Christian+Faith+in+an+Age+of+Uncertaint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c50d7a28a7a78b8f710980ed04f275725ef22c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,80,215,162,138,122,120,184,247,16,152,14,208,79,39,87,37,239,34,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
