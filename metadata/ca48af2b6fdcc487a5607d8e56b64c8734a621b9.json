King's assassination occurred less than a year after the saxophonist's death. While it begins with a sketchy modal theme, the track soon moves toward the far side of the quintet's free expression. \r\n\r\nThe mix on both these tracks is a bit problematic. Much like Om, which was also released in 1968, the sound on these two cuts is somewhat muddy, hinting that these were idea sketches and not finished works. The piano and bass are all but hidden except during solos, and Ali's fiery drumming is often out of balance â€“ either buried or too bright. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, the other two tracks, &quot;Lord, Help Me to Be&quot; and &quot;The Sun,&quot; offer exceptional fidelity. They are essentially Alice's first two recorded pieces for Impulse after signing a solo contract with the label. She is accompanied by Sanders, Garrison, and drummer Ben Riley. \r\n\r\nThese are both fine pieces, with Alice's bluesy modal chord constructions at the fore, recorded in their home studio. The final track, while only a touch over four minutes, is a fine vehicle for Alice's signature pianism. While this record holds up quite well â€“ despite the problems of sound mentioned above â€“ it is still a minor Impulse album compared to some of the saxophonist's master works.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
