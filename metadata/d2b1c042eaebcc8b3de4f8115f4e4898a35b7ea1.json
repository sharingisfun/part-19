School drop-outs, university graduates, people who have been retained, the long-term unemployed, recovered drug addicts, and mid-level managers - all of them are supposed to learn how to market and sell themselves, a skill to which the term &amp;#039;self management&amp;#039; is applied. The self is perhaps nothing more than a metaphysical hook from which to hand a social identity. It was Kafka who likened being accepted to a job to entering the Kingdom of Heaven; the paths leading to both are completely uncertain. Today one speaks of getting a job with the greatest obsequiousness, but without any grand expectations.&quot; Harun Farocki\n\ndirector, scriptwriter: Harun\nFarocki cinematographer: Ingo\nKratisch second cinematographer\nBernd LÃƒÂ¶hr editor: Max Reimann\nsound: Ludger Blanke music: Neil\nYoung researcher: Ludger Blanke\nproduction: Harun Farocki Film-\nproduktion, Berlin, for den SÃƒÂ¼d-\ndeutschen Rundfunk, Stuttgart\nproducer: Harun Farocki\nTV-producer: Juliane Endres\nlength: 58 min. format: video -\nBetaSp, col., 1:1,37 first\nbroadcast: 18.02.1997, arte\ncommissioned for the TV series\nLa vie en face / Welt im Blick\n\n\n\nWeb-site: http://www.farocki-film.de/\n\nImdb link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176538/\n\n\n\n(Not my rip!)\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
