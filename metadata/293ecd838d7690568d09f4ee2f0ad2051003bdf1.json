His pioneering use of jumping shuffle rhythms in a small combo context was copied far and wide during the 1940s. Jordan's sensational hit-laden run with Decca Records contained a raft of seminal performances, featuring inevitably infectious backing by his band, the Tympany Five, and Jordan's own searing alto sax and street corner jive-loaded sense of humor. Jordan was one of the first black entertainers to sell appreciably in the pop sector; his Decca duet mates included Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\n\nThis album is a nice across-the-board compilation spanning his Decca, Aladdin, RCA, Mercury, and Tangerine label stints. The Decca standouts include &quot;Don't Worry 'Bout That Mule&quot; and the often-covered &quot;Ain't That Just like a Woman, &quot; while his Mercury output includes &quot;Big Bess&quot; and &quot;Cat Scratchin'.&quot; Could have done without the live &quot;I Believe in Music&quot; at the end, though -- that isn't the way we want to remember this wonderful performer.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1- Five Guys Named Moe Louis Jordan 3:07\n2- What's the Use of Getting Sober (When You're Gonna Get Drunk Again)? 2:57\n3- Mop!
