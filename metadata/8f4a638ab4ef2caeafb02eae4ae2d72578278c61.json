And although most people see pirates as solitary anarchists out to destroy capitalism, it turns out the opposite is true. They are the ones who forge the path.\nIn The Pirate Organization, Rodolphe Durand and Jean-Philippe Vergne argue that piracy drives capitalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evolution and foreshadows the direction of the economy. Through a rigorous yet engaging analysis of the history and golden ages of piracy, the authors show how pirates form complex and sophisticated organizations that change the course of capitalism. Surprisingly, pirate organizations also behave in predictable ways: challenging widespread norms; controlling resources, communication, and transportation; maintaining trade relationships with other communities; and formulating strategies favoring speed and surprise. We could learn a lot from themÃ¢â‚¬â€if only we paid more attention.\nDurand and Vergne recommend that rather than trying to stamp out piracy, savvy entrepreneurs and organizations should keep a sharp eye on the pirate space to stay successful as the game changesÃ¢â‚¬â€and it always does.\nFirst published in French to great critical acclaim and commercial success as LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Organisation Pirate: Essai sur lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©volution du capitalisme, this book shows that piracy is not random. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s predictable, it cannot be separated from capitalism, and it likely will be the source of capitalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuing evolution.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦this is a stimulating book filled with new ideas. Philosophically minded land- lubbers will enjoy it just as much as barnacle-backs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Economist\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“All this economic theory is paired with engaging analysis of the history and golden ages of piracy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Financial Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An interesting and thought-provoking read. The book debunks popular myths about piracy being random and suggests instead that it is predictable, cannot be separated from capitalism and will be the source of capitalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuing evolution.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Irish Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Rather than try to stamp out piracy, entrepreneurs and businesses should watch how pirates behave in order to stay successful.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Telegraph.co.uk\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is an important book that adds to our understanding of the transition between different phases of capitalism...We recommend it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Compass, the magazine of the Association of Professional Futurists\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Turns out piracy is not just opportunist brigandry, but a driver of capitalist evolution and a pointer to economic direction.
