So here it is again, with no compression at all. Just the files in a folder. Here\\'s an edited version of the description I used for the last one (so now it\\'s correct and hopefully wont get me banned)  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a CD-ROM version of the textbook \\&quot;Modern World History- Patterns of Interaction\\&quot; by McDougal Little (or published by him/them or something; it\\'s on the covver haha). This is my first torrent (now a re-upload of my first). I got the files for this from a different non-torrent site, and decided to upload it here as a first attempt and learn what to do (and what not to do, as it turned out). \n\nI didn\\'t expect much interest in this torrent, but after just two hours I had like 35 connections so I guess there is. My connection sucks, so until someone else gets all this and starts seeding, it\\'ll be really slow and I may not always be available for seeding.  \n\nHopefully I set this up right, if not let me know in the comments and I\\'ll try again. Although a PM on superbay (or is it suprbay?)  with the same username (Slammer94) would be much faster.\n\nEnjoy my first (revised!) attempt :)\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd please don\\'t report or ban this or whatever, it\\'s totally clean (McAfee has no problem with it, at least) and it\\'s a pain to re-upload stuff. If there\\'s a problem, just put it in the comments or PM me and I\\'ll happily fix it as needed to the best of my ability. Thanks, and hopefully this will work out and I can begin to give back to the community I love so much!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8efec4b74262f637afcd27c280ea3bb60818ac03","amp;dn":"Modern+World+History-+Patterns+of+Interaction+%28McDougal+Little%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8efec4b74262f637afcd27c280ea3bb60818ac03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,254,196,183,66,98,246,55,175,205,39,194,128,234,59,182,8,24,172,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
