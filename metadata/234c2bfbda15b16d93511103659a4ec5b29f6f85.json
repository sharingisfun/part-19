The album was produced by Rob Cavallo and was released by Warner Music and Reprise Records on November 22, 2010. Like its predecessor, The Black Parade (2006), the album involved the production of Rob Cavallo.\nRecording the album took more than a year, a period in which more than thirty-six songs were recorded, most of which were discarded.[citation needed] The final edition of the album and its music videos are set in a fictional post-apocalyptic California in the year 2019 (resembling the film Blade Runner), in which a few outsiders dubbed 'Killjoys' are engaged in conflict with a nefarious corporation that seemingly controls the population. Unlike their previous albums, the group has stated that Danger Days is not a concept album, although there are critics who have disputed this.[citation needed]\nThe promotional tour for the album, The World Contamination Tour, lasted from October 2010 to February 2012 and saw concerts in Europe, America, Asia and Oceania. Danger Days topped the Billboard Rock Albums and Alternative Albums charts and peaked at No. 8 in the overall Billboard 200, as well as appearing in charts in numerous other countries. As of February 2011, Danger Days has sold over one million copies worldwide.\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Alternative rock, post-hardcore, emo, pop punk\nQuality: FLAC,tracks,cue\n\nTracklist:\n1. &quot;Look Alive, Sunshine&quot; 0:30\n2. &quot;Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)&quot; 3:23\n3. &quot;Bulletproof Heart&quot; 4:57\n4. &quot;SING&quot; 4:33\n5. &quot;Planetary (GO!)&quot; 4:07\n6. &quot;The Only Hope for Me Is You&quot; 4:34\n7. &quot;Jet-Star and the Kobra Kid/Traffic Report&quot; 0:26\n8. &quot;Party Poison&quot; 3:36\n9. &quot;Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back&quot; 3:50\n10. &quot;S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W&quot; 4:28\n11. &quot;Summertime&quot; 4:07\n12. &quot;DESTROYA&quot; 4:33\n13. &quot;The Kids from Yesterday&quot; 5:25\n14. &quot;Goodnite, Dr. Death&quot; 1:59\n15. &quot;Vampire Money&quot; 3:38","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:234c2bfbda15b16d93511103659a4ec5b29f6f85","amp;dn":"%282010%29+My+Chemical+Romance+-+Danger+Days%3AThe+True+Lives+Of+The+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"234c2bfbda15b16d93511103659a4ec5b29f6f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,76,43,251,218,21,177,109,147,81,17,3,101,154,78,197,178,159,111,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
