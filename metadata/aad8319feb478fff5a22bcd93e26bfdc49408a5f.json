What Veruca Salt has instead is a raw talent for simple, infectious pop songs; the result is a surprisingly fresh fusion of alternative pop and bubblegum. Nina Gordon and Louise Post try hard to inject meaning into the sweet, distorted rush of &quot;Seether,&quot; but all that sticks is the infectious melody and crushing guitars. That also applies to the slower songs, from the enchanting lust of &quot;Spiderman '79&quot; to &quot;Forsythia,&quot; which is too close to the Breeders' Pod for comfort. But musically, American Thighs is surprisingly satisfying; it's a pure pop album masquerading as the next big thing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aad8319feb478fff5a22bcd93e26bfdc49408a5f","amp;dn":"Veruca+Salt+-+American+Thighs+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aad8319feb478fff5a22bcd93e26bfdc49408a5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,216,49,159,235,71,143,255,90,34,188,217,62,38,191,220,73,64,138,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
