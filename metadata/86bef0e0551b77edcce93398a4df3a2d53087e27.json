When the Klingon ship is disabled, they, in turn, assume they \r\nwere attacked by the Enterprise. There is obvious tension between the Enterprise \r\ncrew and its Klingon enemies. Unknown to Kirk and his Klingon counterpart, Kang, \r\nthis is the work of an alien being that gets its energy from the violent emotions between sentient beings. The natural animosities between the two parties feed its appetites.\r\nWhen the creature is beamed aboard the Enterprise, it purposely creates tension\r\namong the crew, to its benefit. The situation eventually forces Kirk and Kang to \r\nwork together to defeat it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n\r\nComplete name : 311 - Day Of The Dove.mkv\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFormat version : Version 2\r\nFile size : 504 MB\r\nDuration : 50min 49sec\r\nOverall bit rate : 1386 Kbps\r\nEncoded date : UTC 2016-08-31T15:12:50Z\r\nWriting application : HandBrake 0.10.5\r\nWriting library : Lavf55.12.0\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\n\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 7 frames\r\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nDuration : 50min 49sec\r\nBit rate : 1262 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1200 pixels\r\nHeight : 900 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio:\r\n\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AC-3\r\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\r\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\r\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\r\nCodec ID : A_AC3\r\nDuration : 50min 49sec\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 96.0 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits\r\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86bef0e0551b77edcce93398a4df3a2d53087e27","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+S03E11+%281968%29+-+BDRip+x264+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86bef0e0551b77edcce93398a4df3a2d53087e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,190,240,224,85,27,119,237,204,233,51,152,164,223,58,45,83,8,126,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
