Any other programs, whether they are unwanted, unlicensed, or simply unnecessary, are blocked from executing. Anti-Executable works on a &quot;whitelist&quot; principle. Any program that is not on the white list is considered unauthorized and will not install or run. With the number and complexity of malware threats steadily increasing, relying solely on definition-based anti-malware solutions to ensure security is no longer enough. Anti-Executable offers a necessary additional layer of protection to the existing &quot;blacklist&quot; solutions such as antivirus software without the need for definition updates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9122f5baf2fbf21108e35382f579438d5a31f7","amp;dn":"Faronics+Anti-Executable+Enterprise+5.40.2100+Final-+%7BRanger.03%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9122f5baf2fbf21108e35382f579438d5a31f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,145,34,245,186,242,251,242,17,8,227,83,130,245,121,67,141,90,49,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
