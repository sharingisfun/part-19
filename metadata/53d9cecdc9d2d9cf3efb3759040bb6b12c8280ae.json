No matter what changes a user makes to a workstation, simply restart to eradicate all changes and reset the computer to its original state - right down to the last byte. Expensive computer assets are kept running at 100% capacity and technical support time is reduced or eliminated completely. The result is consistent trouble-free computing on a truly protected and parallel network, completely free of harmful viruses and unwanted programs. While Deep Freeze provides bulletproof protection, its non-restrictive approach also improves user productivity and satisfaction. Placing no restrictions on a user's ability to access all system resources, users avoid the frustration of downtime due to software conflicts, operating system corruption, virus attacks, and many other problems. Users are always assured of computers that are consistently operable and available.\n\nDeep Freeze is the only solution that effectively balances workstation security with user productivity. By mapping user and application data to a Thawed (unprotected) partition or drive, users are able to store their documents, pictures, music, etc., while still enjoying the total system consistency that Deep Freeze offers.\n\nDeep Freeze offers flexible scheduling options that enable IT administrators to easily create automated update and maintenance periods. Schedule Deep Freeze to allow system and virus definition updates to occur from predefined timesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½either with the Deep Freeze Enterprise Console or using your preferred third-party desktop management solution.\n\nThe Deep Freeze Enterprise Console allows administrators to install, control, and manage Deep Freeze workstations from a single remote location, and hundreds or thousands of workstations can be protected across a distributed LAN, WAN or over the Internet.\n\nDeep FreezeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reboot-to-restore concept significantly lowers Total Cost of Ownership for technology assets because of a vast reduction in time and cost spent maintaining and rebuilding machines. Deep Freeze workstations can be easily controlled and configured via the GUI Enterprise Console, and require no maintenance or definition file updates.\n\nKey Features of DeepFreeze Enterprise:\n\nAbsolute Protection\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Guaranteesworkstation recovery on restart\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Provides password protection and complete security\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Protects multiple hard drives and partitions\n \nIntegration and Compatibility \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports multi-boot environments\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Compatible with Fast User Switching\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports SCSI, ATA, SATA, and IDE hard drives\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Single install for Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP and Vista\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports FAT, FAT32, NTFS, basic and dynamic disks\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Localized in five languages: English, French, German, Spanish &amp;
