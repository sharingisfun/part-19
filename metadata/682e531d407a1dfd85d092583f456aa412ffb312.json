They were used like a club to strike enemies on the head. The scorpion mace head was too large to have been used as a weapon, and was clearly reserved for ceremonial purposes. Archaeologists believe they have found the tomb of the Scorpion King at the ancient burial site of Abydos. He was buried with 700 wine jars, several of which had come from as far away as ancient Palestine.\n\nThe Scorpion King may have presided over the birth of phonetic writing earlier than any other civilization in the world - 200 years before the first pharaohs. During the time of the pharaohs, Egyptian beer was a staple. This beer, made from bread, was not like today's light and refreshing beverage - but a thick, chewy paste. \n\nThe Scorpion King earned his name from two symbols shown on the mace head: a scorpion and a rosette. Along with the narma palette, the scorpion mace head was one of the first objects to provide the earliest images of Egyptian kings. Hieroglyphic numerals etched inside the Scorpion King's tomb showed writing began in Egypt earlier than previously recognized.\n\n\n\n\n                \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n* Video Codec: XviD\n* Video Bitrate: 1808 KB/s\n* Video Aspect Ratio: 1: 76\n* Video Resolution: 704 x 400\n* Audio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\n* Audio BitRate:256KB/s\n* Run-Time: 47mins\n* Framerate:25FPS\n* Number Of Parts:1\n* Part Size:700MB\n* Ripped by artistharry\n* Subtitles: none\n* Source: TVrip\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:682e531d407a1dfd85d092583f456aa412ffb312","amp;dn":"The+Scorpion+King++%28National+Geographic+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"682e531d407a1dfd85d092583f456aa412ffb312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,46,83,29,64,122,29,253,133,208,146,88,63,69,106,164,18,255,179,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
