Written by Agatha Christie; Full-cast dramatisation starring Geoffrey Whitehead, Stephen Tomkinson, Melinda Walker, Barbara Atkinson, Susan Westerby and John Moffat; Dramatised by Michael Bakewell.\n\nA blizzard has hit England. In the tiny village of Sittaford, on the fringes of Dartmoor, a party of six is gathered in Sittaford House, home of Captain Trevelyan. He has rented the house out for the winter and is staying in a nearby village. As evening draws in, a seance is proposed. But it reveals more than they had anticipated - Trevelyan Dead, spells out the board. Slowly, the table begins to rock again, spelling out the word M-U-R-D-E-R. Is it true? And who would kill a man who doesn't have an enemy in the world?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b968b0764b7946a5f5f86c0c8892dfc61ce2250","amp;dn":"Agatha+Christie+-+The+Sittaford+Mystery+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b968b0764b7946a5f5f86c0c8892dfc61ce2250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,150,139,7,100,183,148,106,95,95,134,192,200,137,45,252,97,206,34,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
