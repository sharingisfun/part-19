On continuous is really the only way to enjoy this stuff.\n\nPOMPLAMOOSE\n\nYouTube and actual life sensation Pomplamoose has individual videos viewed over 86 million times on YouTube alone.\n\n&quot;Pomplamoose is an American indie music duo consisting of multi-instrumentalists Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn. The duo formed in the summer of 2008 and sold approximately 100,000 songs online in 2009.&quot; -- According to the interwebs, so it's true.\n\nThis torrent includes a high-def copy of every musical track they've ever uploaded, minus all the talking and what-not boshat at the end. When consuming music, you don't need that, so I just slashed it down to nothing but the beats.\n\nThe files are all FLV format in either hi-def, or the highest def available from the source recording.\n\nPlease seed and please enjoy. These guys give me endless hours of enjoyment, so I hope you feel the same way.\n\nTRACK LISTING:\n1 - Hey It's Pomplamoose Theme Song\n2 - If you think you need some lovin\n3 - Single Ladies (put a ring on it)\n4 - Don't stop lovin me\n5 - Beat it\n6 - Achin Heart\n7 - Mrs. Robinson\n8 - River Shiver\n9 - Mister Sandman\n10 - I'll be there in a minute\n11 - September\n12 - Centrifuge\n13 - Telephone\n14 - Another Day\n15 - Nature Boy\n16 - Bust Your Knee Caps\n17 - I don't wanna miss a thing\n18 - Expiration date\n19 - Do not push\n20 - Monster mask\n21 - My favorite things\n22 - Angry Birds theme song\n23 - Little Things\n24 - Twice as Nice\n25 - Batman theme\n26 - Makin out\n27 - Gatekeeper\n28 - Let's go for a ride\n29 - Be still\n30 - Beat the horse\n31 - Hail Mary\n32 - La Vie en Rose\n33 - Le commun des mortels\n34 - O come all ye faithful\n35 - Deck the halls\n36 - Always in the season\n37 - Up on the rooftop\n38 - Jingle Bells\n39 - The goodbye song\n\nOh, and I'm a torrent creator, so I'm supposed to spam some a bunch of links. Only problem is I'm a non-commercial one, so I don't really have anything to sell.
