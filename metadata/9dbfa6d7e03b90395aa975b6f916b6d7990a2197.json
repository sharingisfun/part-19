Twenty-year-plus engineering veteran Ivana Suchy's Second Edition of the Handbook of Die Design now adds to its comprehensive coverage new ways to improve processes and reduce costs, from design through manufacturing. Whatever you blank, pierce, punch, bend, form, draw, or otherwise fabricate, this reference gives you the hands-on guidance and use-it-now data you need to do it better, faster, safer. It's loaded with at-a-glance charts, step-by-step guidelines, rules of thumb, and up-to-the-minute techniques for ensuring precision design for every type of sheet metal pressworking. It's the essential on-the-job tool for engineers, designers, and technicians in die design and the pressworking range of operations looking for better evaluations and greater job satisfaction.\n\nNEW WAYS TO IMPROVE PROCESSES AND CUT COSTS\n\n    * Useful new hardware and specialized hardware\n    * Custom-made automated systems\n    * New types of pressroom equipment\n    * Illustrations and specifications for rotary bending techniques\n    * New coating processes to increase tool durability and prevent galling\n    * Additional strip samples and actual die design/manufacturing problems\n    * More detail on strain hardening of material and its effect on drawing, forming, and bending operations, and the tooling involved\n    * Illustrated explanations of the use of nitrogen cylinders and air springs in die manufacture\n    * U.S. symbols added to metric for all dimensions and math applications, including tolerance ranges\n\nDIE DESIGN, INSIDE OUT:\nBasic Die Design and Die-Work Influencing Factors * The Theory of Sheet-Metal Behavior * Metal Stamping Dies and Their Function * Metal Stamping Dies: Their Construction and Assembly * Metalworking Machinery * Blanking and Piercing Operations * Blank Calculation or Flat Layout * Bending and Forming Operations * Drawn Parts * Practical Die Design * Die Process Quality and Automation, and Die Maintenance * Springs: Their Design and Calculations * Spring Washers * Materials and Surface Finish * Die Cost Estimating\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 729 pages\n    * Publisher: McGraw-Hill Professional; 2 edition (December 1, 2005)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0071462716\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0071462716","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dbfa6d7e03b90395aa975b6f916b6d7990a2197","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Die+Design+2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dbfa6d7e03b90395aa975b6f916b6d7990a2197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,191,166,215,224,59,144,57,90,169,117,182,249,22,182,215,153,10,33,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
