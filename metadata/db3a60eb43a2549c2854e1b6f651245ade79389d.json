Learning and cognition is the foundation of cognitive psychology and encompasses many topics including attention, memory, categorization, etc. Most books in the area either focus on one subtopic in-depth (e.g. an entire book on memory) or cover the gamut of subjects in a series of long, technical handbook-like chapters. This concise reference offers researchers and professors teaching in the area a new take on the material that is comprehensive in breadth, but lighter in depth - focusing on main findings, established facts, and minimizing the amount of space taken up by large, multi-volume references.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db3a60eb43a2549c2854e1b6f651245ade79389d","amp;dn":"Learning+and+Cognition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db3a60eb43a2549c2854e1b6f651245ade79389d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,58,96,235,67,162,84,156,40,84,225,182,246,81,36,90,222,121,56,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
