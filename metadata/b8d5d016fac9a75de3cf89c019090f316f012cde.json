And there are a couple of old, unfinished projects returning to (hopefully) regular publication in Colleen Doran's A Distant Soil #39 and Whispers #5.\n\nAlso included in this pack are 5 more comics. First, the corrected version of Danger Club #5. (With 100% more arm-ripping-off goodness!) And the other 4 are the digital-exclusive G-Man comics by Chris Giarrusso. They've been coming out on Comixology on Tuesdays, and I've passed over them without noticing the Image &quot;I&quot;.  **Technically, #1 came out last year, but c'mon, why would I throw in #2-4 and not #1? I'm not that anal-retentive.**\n\nPlease seed and share with our friends here on TPB!  --STFmaryville\n\n------\n\nA Distant Soil #39\n\n15-year-old Liana now sits on the throne of the Avatar, a living weapon of mass destruction, the most powerful psionic in the universe.
