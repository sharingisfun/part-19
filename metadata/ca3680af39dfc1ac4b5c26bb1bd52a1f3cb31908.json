The second edition of this book offers up-to-date coverage of recent energy efficient and sustainable technological methods and solutions, covering analysis, design and performance improvement as well as life-cycle costing and assessment. As well as having significantly revised the book for use as a graduate text, the authors address real-life technical and operational problems, enabling the reader to gain an understanding of the fundamental principles and practical applications of thermal energy storage technology.\n\nBeginning with a general summary of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and heat transfer, this book goes on to discuss practical applications with chapters that include TES systems, environmental impact, energy savings, energy and exergy analyses, numerical modeling and simulation, case studies and new techniques and performance assessment methods.\n\n\nHardcover: 620 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 2 edition (November 11, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470747064\nISBN-13: 978-0470747063","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca3680af39dfc1ac4b5c26bb1bd52a1f3cb31908","amp;dn":"Thermal+Energy+Storage+Systems+and+Applications%2C2nd+Ed%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca3680af39dfc1ac4b5c26bb1bd52a1f3cb31908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,54,128,175,57,223,193,172,75,92,38,187,27,213,42,31,60,179,25,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
