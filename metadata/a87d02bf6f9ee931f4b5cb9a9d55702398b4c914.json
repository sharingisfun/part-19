Frey played guitar with Eagles as well as piano and keyboards and sang lead vocals on many Eagles hits such as &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot;, &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Already Gone&quot;, &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot;, &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;, and &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;.\n\nAfter the breakup of Eagles in 1980, Frey embarked on a successful solo career. He released his debut album, No Fun Aloud in 1982 and went on to record Top 40 hits &quot;The One You Love&quot;, &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot;, &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;, &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, &quot;You Belong to the City&quot;, &quot;True Love&quot;, &quot;Soul Searchin'&quot;, and &quot;Livin' Right&quot;.\n\nAs a member of Eagles, Frey won six Grammy Awards, and five American Music Awards. Eagles have sold over 120 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, the first year they were nominated. As a solo artist and with Eagles combined, Frey has released 24 Top 40 singles on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nFrey's nickname is &quot;G-Money&quot;.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Allnighter is the second studio solo album by Glenn Frey, the guitarist and co-lead vocalist for the Eagles. The album was released in mid 1984 on MCA in the United States and the United Kingdom, two years after Frey's modestly successful dÃƒÂ©but album, No Fun Aloud and four years after the demise of the Eagles. It was and still is Frey's most successful solo album throughout his whole solo career, having reached #22 on the Billboard charts, and releasing two Top 20 singles with &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot; and &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;. The album achieved Gold status by the RIAA in the US. It is generally regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of Frey's solo work.\n\nThe single &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot; helped to inspire the Miami Vice episode of the same name, and Frey was invited to star in that episode, which was Frey's acting dÃƒÂ©but. The music video for the single also won Frey an MTV Video Music Award in 1985","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a87d02bf6f9ee931f4b5cb9a9d55702398b4c914","amp;dn":"Glenn+Frey+-+The+Allnighter+%5B1984%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a87d02bf6f9ee931f4b5cb9a9d55702398b4c914","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,125,2,191,111,158,233,49,244,181,203,154,157,85,112,35,152,180,201,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
