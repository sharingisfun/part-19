Every result is fully derived. If you are fascinated by definite integrals, then this is a book for you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b55dc785532834d32bf8f06cd69f3f7d7e59d104","amp;dn":"Inside+Interesting+Integrals+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b55dc785532834d32bf8f06cd69f3f7d7e59d104","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,93,199,133,83,40,52,211,43,248,240,108,214,159,63,125,126,89,209,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
