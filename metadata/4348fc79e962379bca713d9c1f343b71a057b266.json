I put in about $40 and 15 hours maybe more into this so please enjoy.\nI will try to keep this up to date and will reupload when Final Fantasy Medley comes out.\nAll the tracks that were on iTunes were purchased then converted to 320kbps mp3.\nA few are from other torrents on The Pirate Bay or downloaded off of YouTube (The tubes :D).\nLindsey Stirling is under contributing artist on all songs in the tags, excluding Stomp on Melvin and the Christmas songs, so it is easier to play on devices. The tracks are in folders based on who else is on the track.\nFeel free to distribute this everywhere!\n\nTrack List - 76 total\nAlex Boye and The Salt Lake Pops\nGranade (Instrumental Version)\nGranade\n\nAllred\nTomb (Live)\nWaiting (iTunes) - Not 100% this is Lindsey\nWaiting (YouTube)\n\nArtie Hemphill and the Iron Horse Band - You Don't Know Her Like I Do\n\nBenton Paul - Paris (Live)\n\nCan't Stop Won't Stop - Come With Us\n\nChristmas\nCeltic Carol\nSilent Night Violin\nWhat Child is This\n\nDebbi Johanson - River Flows In You\n\nEppic - By No Means\n\nJake Bruene - Party Rock Anthem\n\nJustin Williams - Lying\n\nKuha'o Case\nBring Him Home (Les Miserables)\nCome Thou Fount\nCrystallize\nLights Bassnectar Remix\nPhantom of the Opera Freestyle\n\nKurt Hugo and Aimee Proal - A Thousand Years\n\nLindsey Stirling - Ripped from physical CD at 320kbps\nElectric Daisy Violin\nZi-Zi's Journey\nCrystallize\nSong Of The Caged Bird\nMoon Trance\nMinimal Beat\nTranscendence\nElements\nShadows\nSpontaneous Me\nAnti Gravity\nStars Align\n\nLive\nBreak Your Heat - Tick Tock\nFreestyle on UrbanMediaShow\nMy Immortal (Evanescence Cover)\nRob's Song\nTranscendence Street Jam\nThe SIDH - The Legend of SIDH\nHip-Hop Violin Right Round\n\nMaddie Wilson and Shaun Canon - Sail Away, Soldier\n\nMegan Nicole - Starships\n\nOff The Falls\nHeaven (Bryan Adams Cover)\nI Want It That Way (Backstreet Boys Cover)\n\nPentatonix - Radioactive\n\nPeter Hollens\nGame of Thrones (Main Title)\nSkyrim (Main Theme)\n\nShaun Canon - Don't Carry it All\n\nSingles\nAssassin's Creed Theme\nGood Feeling Violin Remix\nLord of the Rings Medley\nPhantom of the Opera Medley\nWe Found Love\nZelda Violin Duet\n\nStomp on Melvin - Tinnabulous - Purchased off iTunes then converted to 320kbps mp3\nTinnabulous... the Stars Are Bright\nGlorious Occasion\nElectroman\nAlookin in Your Eyes\nLost Locket\nStanding There (Brownie Girl)\nBuy American\nDance Dance Theater\nOne of a Kind\nFeel It Inside Too\nA Summer Sundown\nFrom the Start\nFarewell Springtide\n\nTay Zonday - Mama Economy\n\nThe Piano Guys - Mission Impossible\n\nThe Vibrant Sound - Golddigger\n\nTyler Ward\nSome Kind of Beautiful\nThrift Shop\n\nTyler Ward and Chester See\nDaylight\nI Knew You Were Trouble","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4348fc79e962379bca713d9c1f343b71a057b266","amp;dn":"Complete+Lindsey+Stirling+Collection+-+76+Tracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4348fc79e962379bca713d9c1f343b71a057b266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,72,252,121,233,98,55,155,202,113,61,156,31,52,59,113,160,87,178,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
