This is first comprehensive book on data integration and is written by three of the most respected experts in the field. \nThis book provides an extensive introduction to the theory and concepts underlying today's data integration techniques, with detailed, instruction for their application using concrete examples throughout to explain the concepts. Data integration is the problem of answering queries that span multiple data sources (e.g., databases, web pages). Data integration problems surface in multiple contexts, including enterprise information integration, query processing on the Web, coordination between government agencies and collaboration between scientists. In some cases, data integration is the key bottleneck to making progress in a field. \nThe authors provide a working knowledge of data integration concepts and techniques, giving you the tools you need to develop a complete and concise package of algorithms and applications. \n*Offers a range of data integration solutions enabling you to focus on what is most relevant to the problem at hand. \n*Enables you to build your own algorithms and implement your own data integration applications \n*Companion website with numerous project-based exercises and solutions and slides. Links to commercially available software allowing readers to build their own algorithms and implement their own data integration applications.
