In Robert Lockwood Jr we have an artist who qualifies for the sobriquet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the legendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on both counts, being an octogenarian, having been born in 1915, and possessing a rare talent, as both an instrumentalist and a singer, preserving it intact to the present day, as evidenced by this live set recorded at the Rhythm Room in Phoenix in July 2003.\nOver the course of the 44 minutes that this CD lasts, Lockwood transports us back to an era when the blues was in itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prime; telling intimate stories, that everyone could connect to, and doing so to a subtle guitar backing that mirrored the moods and emotions being expressed, the guitar an extension to, not a substitute for the vocals, as one listen to the plaintive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Meet Me In The BottomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ will testify.\nAs Lockwood has grown older, his vocals have developed a natural poignancy that is mesmerizing in itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quality, luring you into a world where sorrows and loneliness can be shared with others who have experienced and can understand itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotions and frustrations; the Leroy Carr numbers, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Mean Mistreater MamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“How LongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“In The EveningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ being prime examples of this as they effectively capture the plaintiveness and weariness inherent in CarrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work.  Lockwood is also an acknowledged doyen of the twelve string guitar, often using his mastery of it to add subtle tones, textures and shades to his blues, bringing a jazzy quality to the relaxed swing of numbers like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Exactly Like YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and Roosevelt SykesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Feel Like BlowinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ My HornÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\nLockwoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s connections to Robert Johnson are well documented, so I wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t delve into those again, but inevitably several Johnson numbers are featured on this set, and one has to say that no one else is more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“qualifiedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to perform these than Lockwood; but, to his credit, he is no mere imitator, investing each of the four Johnson blues chosen with his own unique personality and style, the numbers just a launching pad allowing him to express his own vision of the blues.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Sweet Home ChicagoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ conjures up a vision of an almost sophisticated Big Joe Williams; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Love In VainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is an almost palpable piece of melancholia; the pensive qualities in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“From Four Until LateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ are mesmerizing in their intensity, whilst ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Rambling On My MindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ evokes none of the torment of the original, LockwoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s phrasing and tone indicating a reluctant resignation to accepting the inevitable.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Legend LiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a simple but apt title for this set, which receives an unqualified recommendation. \nRating 10\n--- Mick Rainsford  Blues in Britain magazine\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
