At its head, a filthy cattletruck containing four punk mummersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and something else. The band plays sudden, violent and hate-filled gigs along the way: Dartmoor, Glastonbury Tor, an old cemetery in Bristol. And every time they play, people die in unspeakable ways. Aristocrats, high-flying stockbrokers, police officers, all find themselves the victims of a Class War that is threatening to shatter society.\n\nWithin the dark cattletruck, a malevolent force is leading this ragged army on a Magical Mayhem Tour towards its final, secret destination. With Jo powerless to resist its seductive influence and the Doctor lost in a nightmarish void, can the band from hell be prevented from staging its final society-cracking performance, and thus spelling the end of the road forÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ everything?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e87ea3a506c05858dbd68fd79a9a4b58f3e2b02","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Rags+-+Mick+Lewis.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e87ea3a506c05858dbd68fd79a9a4b58f3e2b02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,135,234,58,80,108,5,133,141,189,104,253,121,169,164,181,143,62,43,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
