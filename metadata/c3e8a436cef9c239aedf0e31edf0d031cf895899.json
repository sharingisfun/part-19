Bryan Sutton thoughtfully and methodically lays out his tricks of the trade to help you play any tune and improve your flatpicking speed, power, timing and musicianship. Bryan addresses many of the problems that he sees in aspiring pickers, and passes along tips on how to keep your picking hand and arm tension-free and your fretting hand supple and quick. He provides drills and exercises, teaching an arsenal of licks, bends, double stops, slides and other devices that will help you build powerful and memorable solos. In a special section on rhythm playing, Bryan plays backup to Cody Kilby's lead solos and shows how, by varying his chords and bass runs, he builds a groove and enhances the tune. He breaks down, in detail, famous bluegrass jam session tunes - Daley's Reel, Texas Gales, Wild Bill Jones and Beaumont Rag - each of which shows a different aspect of the flatpick experience. &quot;Once your technique and fundamentals are down you can just play and let the ideas take over.&quot; - Bryan \n\nUploaded by me JohnnyCash","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3e8a436cef9c239aedf0e31edf0d031cf895899","amp;dn":"Bryan+Sutton+Secret+for+succesfull+Flatpicking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3e8a436cef9c239aedf0e31edf0d031cf895899","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,232,164,54,206,249,194,57,174,223,14,49,237,240,208,49,207,137,88,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
