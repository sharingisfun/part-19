With little to no effort you can instantly force programs &amp; games to run faster on your computer without having to purchase new hardware. Most programs are designed to use a minimal amount of CPU (processor) power which often leads to the CPU being idle and not used to its fullest potential, with PCBoost your computer is able to take advantage of this by allocating more CPU power to the currently active application.\n\nPCBoost constantly monitors which application is running as the foreground and active program; it then tells the CPU to give this application priority over all other applications. This direct instruction to the CPU forces the application to get more attention and quickly finish any tasks that are required as soon as possible. If you switch to another program or game PCBoost instantly notices this change and instructs the CPU to set the old application to a normal priority and the newly active and foreground application to a higher priority. This approach allows the current and active program to always use the most CPU power as possible.\n\n\nFeatures:\n=========\n\n-Optimizes games and applications by increasing the processor priority thread of the currently active application, allowing these programs to run faster.\n-Runs in the background, which allows the software to run quietly and accelerate applications without user interaction.\n-New ideal processor setting automatically sets applications to use processor cores that are not being fully utilized.\n-Processor benchmark test feature has been added in to get an estimate of how fast and stable your computer processor is.\n-Built-in and fully editable block list of applications which are not compatible, to prevent problems with the software such as slowdowns or computer crashes.\n-New and improved modern user interface, easy and intuitive to use and compliant with Windows user interface guidelines.\n-Software updates can be downloaded and installed directly from inside the application without having to visit our web site.\n-Compatible with Microsoft Windows 8, 7, Vista, XP &amp; Windows Server 2012, 2008, 2003. (X32BIT AND X64BIT Compatible).\n\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\nFor anyone WHO MAY HAVE issues with installation, extraction, wrong file extensions, passwords etc for this or any of my other installer torrents.
