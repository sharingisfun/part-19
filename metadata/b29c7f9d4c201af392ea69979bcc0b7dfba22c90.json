This bassless trio recorded No Bass Hit in 1979, then returned for an encore with Major League in 1986. The two-disc set Double Play re-introduces both titles while keeping the baseball metaphor intact. Quiet standards by the Gershwins and Cole Porter trade places with up-tempo delights like Gene Krupa and Roy Eldridge's &quot;Drum Boogie.&quot; One might imagine missing the steady beat of the bass, but a cursory listen to &quot;Easy to Love&quot; verifies that this isn't the case. McKenna plays chords with one hand while keeping a steady bass rhythm with the other, assuring a solid beat even when he's playing lead. The band swings with vim and vigor on &quot;Swinging at the Copper Rail&quot; and &quot;It All Depends on You,&quot; while offering relaxed versions of &quot;I'm Through With Love&quot; and &quot;This Is All I Ask.&quot; Part of the joy of this band is their versatility, with Hamilton and McKenna exchanging lead lines or with Hanna kicking off a song with a snazzy drum roll. Double Play offers an hour and a half of excellent mainstream jazz and serves as a fine addition to the works of all the players involved.
