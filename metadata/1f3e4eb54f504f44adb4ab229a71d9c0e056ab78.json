The build may not work on your distribution of Linux, but you should be able to use the instructions at that web site and and the source, and the data, to make a working copy of the game on your machine.  It works fine on my computer so far!  There is no official binary yet (as of March 1, 2012) for Arx Libertatis for any system hence I have christened this build v0000.  \n\nHere is a brief summary of the instructions for building:\n\nFor the build environment on an apt-based Linux distro you will need to issue the following command to download the libraries you need or just download them individually:\n\nsudo apt-get install git cmake g++ zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev libdevil1c2 libdevil-dev libopenal1 libopenal-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libboost-all-dev libsdl-dev libglew-dev\n\nThen you will need to clone the source code (provided) and run 'cmake' in the ArxLibertatis directory and then 'make' or 'make install'.  To run the game you will need to copy the provided data files data.pak, data2.pak, loc.pak, sfx.pak, speech.pak and the directory 'misc' with the files arx.ttf and logo.bmp into the data directory for ArxLibertatis, which can be any directory if you are going to run the binary 'arx' in that directory or one of the data directories listed in the README.md file if you 'make install' a system-wide installation.  You might also want to create a file 'cfg.ini' file in the data directory with the following lines or else the game will prompt you to do so:\n\n[misc]\nmigration=1\n\nIf you followed all the instructions you should be able to run Arx Fatalis natively under Linux! :-)\n\n- FluxCapacitor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f3e4eb54f504f44adb4ab229a71d9c0e056ab78","amp;dn":"Arx+Libertatis+Arx+Fatalis+Linux+source_data_x86-64-build","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f3e4eb54f504f44adb4ab229a71d9c0e056ab78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,62,78,181,79,80,79,68,173,180,171,34,154,113,217,192,224,86,171,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
