It can be restated as the theme of form and content that is so often discussed in A Course in Miracles. The ego preserves itÃ‚Â­self by having us identify with the external or physical form at the expense of the mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content. In the context of this book, we see the egoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ingenuity in having us focus on the external symptoms of sickness, their amelioration then seen as healing. True healing, however, comes only when we let the true Healer return our attention to the mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s symptom of guilt. By so doing, our unhealed minds are cleansed of the erÃ‚Â­roneous belief in guiltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reality, freeing us to become healed healers. \n\nOur recognizing that sickness and healing are only of the mind is one of the CourseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major purposes, for it is the basis of forgiveness. It is the purpose of this book to help further studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ understanding of this process, which is a signifiÃ‚Â­cant part of the healing journey we take with Jesus. It is not their hands that heal. \nIt is not their voice that speaks the Word of God. They merely give what has been given them.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ And this is the function of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teachers; to see no will as separate from their own, nor theirs as separate from GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ece6f73e96c58e1844e72e402f4f3c8fe2dd31a","amp;dn":"healing+the+unhealed+mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ece6f73e96c58e1844e72e402f4f3c8fe2dd31a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,206,111,115,233,108,88,225,132,78,114,228,2,244,243,200,254,45,211,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
