Out Of Time (US Version)\n\n  The Rolling Stones finally delivered a set of all-original material with this LP, which also did much to define the group as the bad boys of rock &amp; roll with their sneering attitude toward the world in general and the female sex in particular. The borderline misogyny could get a bit juvenile in tunes like &quot;Stupid Girl.&quot; But on the other hand the group began incorporating the influences of psychedelia and Dylan into their material with classics like &quot;Paint It Black,&quot; an eerily insistent number one hit graced by some of the best use of sitar (played by Brian Jones) on a rock record. Other classics included the jazzy &quot;Under My Thumb,&quot; where Jones added exotic accents with his vibes, and the delicate Elizabethan ballad &quot;Lady Jane,&quot; where dulcimer can be heard. Some of the material is fairly ho-hum, to be honest, as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were still prone to inconsistent songwriting; &quot;Goin' Home,&quot; an 11-minute blues jam, was remarkable more for its barrier-crashing length than its content. Look out for an obscure gem, however, in the brooding, meditative &quot;I Am Waiting.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f52d5d52267b6e5ec5d8918265457ff00144e81","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Aftermath+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f52d5d52267b6e5ec5d8918265457ff00144e81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,82,213,213,34,103,182,229,236,93,137,24,38,84,87,255,0,20,78,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
