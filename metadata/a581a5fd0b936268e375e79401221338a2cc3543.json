Read more about DVD formats.)\n# Number of discs: 1\n# Studio: Blue Crane Digital\n# DVD Release Date: October 27, 2008\n# Run Time: 122 minutes\n# Average Customer Review: 4.6 out of 5 stars  See all reviews (5 customer reviews)\n# ASIN: B001H4P9OK\n\n\nThe Nikon D300 and D700 cameras can be overwhelming for new owners regardless of their experience.\n\nWith over 50 custom settings, pages of menu options, and configurable buttons on the outside of the camera, new owners may struggle to understand which controls can improve their photography.\n\nIn this two hour DVD, Blue Crane Digital distills many of the important settings and provides real world examples and exercises for D300 and D700 owners. In addition, the presentation charts the path of your image from the camera, through post processing to a final print or being viewed on the web.\n\nThis DVD is broken down into four sections:\n1) explanations of many custom settings and controls\n2) acquiring and maintaining the colors you see when you take the photo, including an introduction to color management and dealing with sub-optimal lighting sources\n3) an overview, with examples of using Commander Mode and wireless remote speedlights\n4) a short discussion of how to store and organize your settings for consistently better results.\n\nThis DVD assumes the viewer has a good overall understanding of digital photography and the basic controls on their camera.\n\nThe contents of this presentation are a logical extension of the Blue Crane Digital title: Introduction to the Nikon D300. It is intended for intermediate to semi-advanced users.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a581a5fd0b936268e375e79401221338a2cc3543","amp;dn":"Blue+Crane+-+Nikon+D300+%26+D700+Advanced+Topics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a581a5fd0b936268e375e79401221338a2cc3543","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,129,165,253,11,147,98,104,227,117,231,148,1,34,19,56,162,204,53,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
