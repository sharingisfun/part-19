Two lonely schoolboys at the end of childhood are forced into an unwanted companionship. One of them is terrified of what the future holds.\n\nDoes music have its ghosts? Its victims? Something is stirring in the cathedral that both echoes an ancient tragedy and seems to offer a chance of future happiness. One thing is certain. Broken voices make false promises. And their lies may prove fatal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213c6638e1f576adb157915887b4cab195c1ac46","amp;dn":"Broken+Voices+-+Andrew+Taylor.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213c6638e1f576adb157915887b4cab195c1ac46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,60,102,56,225,245,118,173,177,87,145,88,135,180,202,177,149,193,172,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
