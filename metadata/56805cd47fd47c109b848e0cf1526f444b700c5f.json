Thanks to his involvement in the groups of such standard bearers as Howard McGhee, Dexter Gordon, Art Pepper and Wardell Gray, he developed rapidly and when Chet Baker made his first quartet recordings in December 1952, he chose Freeman as pianist, composer and musical director. FreemanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reputation also earned him a place with the Lighthouse All-Stars, Shorty Rogers Giants and, for ten years from 1955, with Shelly Manne and his Men. \n\nThis CD is dedicated to the memory of Russ Freeman (1926-2002), an extraordinary but too often underrated jazz pianist who deserves a place among the greatest. \n\nAll tracks recorded in Hollywood, California from 1952 to 1959.\n\nTracks 1 - 3: Russ Freeman (piano); Bob Whitlock (bass); Bobby White (drums)\nTracks 4 - 11: Russ Freeman (piano); Joe Mondragon (bass); Shelly Manne (drums)\nTracks 12 - 14: Bud Shank (alto sax &amp; flute); Russ Freeman (piano); Carson Smith (bass); Shelly Manne (drums)\nTracks 15 - 21: Russ Freeman (piano); Monty Budwig (bass); Shelly Manne (drums); Stu Williamson (trumpet)\nTrack 22: Russ Freeman (piano); Billy Bean (guitar); Monty Budwig (bass); Mel Lewis (drums)\n\n1.
