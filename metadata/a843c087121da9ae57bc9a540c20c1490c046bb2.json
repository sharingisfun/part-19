She pretends to be contemplating suicide in order to finagle some money out of a male friend in order to pay her bills. Then, she receives a wedding invitation from her daughter Susan (Elizabeth Taylor). As a young woman, Julia had married wealthy William Packett (Walter Pidgeon). However, after fourteen months of marriage, his disapproving mother (Lucile Watson) had managed to break them up. Julia returned to show business, but left her infant daughter with her husband, so that the child could be raised in more secure circumstances.\n\nOn the boat trip to France, she meets and becomes attracted to Fred Ghenoccio (Cesar Romero), a muscular acrobat, and in Paris performs with his troupe to great success. Later, Fred proposes to her as her train pulls away from the station.\n\nWhen Julia reaches her destination, she is penniless, so following her usual methods, she gets a stranger, Colonel Willowbrook (Nigel Bruce), to give her money, supposedly for an evening gown and other clothing. However, she sneaks away before Willowbrook tries to become better acquainted with her.\n\nHer mother-in-law is less than pleased to see her, but Julia manages to see Susan, who insists she stay. As time goes by, William's love for Julia revives. Meanwhile, Julia observes that Susan has strong feelings about lovestruck painter Ritchie Lorgan (Peter Lawford), though he is not her fiancÃƒÂ©. Though Susan claims to be merely annoyed, Julia sees that Susan loves the young man and does her best to bring the two together. It works.\n\nMeanwhile, Julia remains skeptical of William's restored love, unable to forget the past. Complications arise when Fred shows up to claim his &quot;fiancÃƒÂ©e&quot;. However, when William encounters his old friend, Colonel Willowbrook, he learns of Julia's misdeed. William persuades his friend to pretend to not know him and interrupt their breakfast. The revelation of Julia's questionable method of raising funds sends Fred packing.\n\nEventually, Susan takes Julia's suggestion and elopes with Ritchie. When William chases after them, followed by Julia, they discover they have been tricked into going to the wrong place. Following Susan's instructions, servants drive away their cars, leaving them stranded for 48 hours in their isolated honeymoon cabin. Julia tries to walk away in a rainstorm, but ends up in the mud. When William comes to her rescue, he ends up sprawled in the muck as well, leaving them both laughing at their predicament.\n\nCAST NOTES:-\n    Elizabeth Taylor not only turned 16 during the filming of Julia Misbehaves, she also received her first onscreen kiss during it, from Peter Lawford. Taylor had a crush on Lawford, and pursued him, but he had been warned that she was off-limits, and finally had to tell her there was no chance of a romance between them. Taylor stayed in bed for days after that, until a visit from Lawford smoothed things out, and they remained friends.\n    During filming, Lawford introduced Greer Garson to E. E. &quot;Buddy&quot; Fogelson, a oil and cattle millionaire from Texas, who she married the next year.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nJulia Misbehaves began with the working titles &quot;The Nutmeg Tree&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the title of the 1937 novel by Margery Sharp it was based on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and &quot;Speak to Me of Love&quot;. The screenplay was originally to have been written by James Hilton and would have starred Gracie Fields. Announced in April 1941, it was postponed later in the year due to Fields unavailability.\nIn 1946 the project was revived, with Greer Garson in the lead role and with Everett Riskin as the producer, replacing Dore Schary, who had replaced Sidney Franklin.\nJulia Misbehaves was the fourth of six films in which Walter Pidgeon and Greer Garson co-starred.\nThe film earned $2,948,000 in the US and Canada and $1,549,000 overseas resulting in a profit of $298,000.\n\nThe reviewer for the New York Times commented that Garson was &quot;out of her element&quot; in the film, although the Variety reviewer said that she &quot;aquits (sic) herself like a lady out to prove she can be hoydenish when necessary. She proves it and audiences will like the new Garson.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 786 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 99 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a843c087121da9ae57bc9a540c20c1490c046bb2","amp;dn":"Julia+Misbehaves+%281948%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Greer+Garson%2C+Elizabeth+Taylo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a843c087121da9ae57bc9a540c20c1490c046bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,67,192,135,18,29,169,174,87,188,154,84,12,32,193,73,12,4,107,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
