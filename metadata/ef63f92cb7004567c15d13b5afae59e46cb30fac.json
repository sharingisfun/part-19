Every crisis that has ripped through this region in the ensuing decades, from the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to the ongoing intifada, is a direct consequence of those six days of fighting. Michael B. Orenâ€™s magnificent Six Days of War, an internationally acclaimed bestseller, is the first comprehensive account of this epoch-making event.\r\n\r\nWriting with a novelistâ€™s command of narrative and a historianâ€™s grasp of fact and motive, Oren reconstructs both the lightning-fast action on the battlefields and the political shocks that electrified the world. Extraordinary personalitiesâ€”Moshe Dayan and Gamal Abdul Nasser, Lyndon Johnson and Alexei Kosyginâ€”rose and toppled from power as a result of this war; borders were redrawn; daring strategies brilliantly succeeded or disastrously failed in a matter of hours. And the balance of power changedâ€”in the Middle East and in the world. A towering work of history and an enthralling human narrative, Six Days of War is the most important book on the Middle East conflict to appear in a generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=====================\r\nPaperback: 480 pages\r\nPublisher: Presidio Press (June 3, 2003)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0345461924\r\nISBN-13: 978-0345461926","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef63f92cb7004567c15d13b5afae59e46cb30fac","amp;dn":"Six+Days+of+War%2C+by+Michael+B.+Oren+%5BePub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef63f92cb7004567c15d13b5afae59e46cb30fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,99,249,44,183,0,69,103,193,93,19,181,175,174,89,228,108,179,15,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
