The reissue was remastered in 24-bit sound with \nnew notes by Paul Grein.\n\n&quot;Yesterday Once More&quot;, written by Richard Carpenter and John Bettis, is a hit song by \nThe Carpenters from their 1973 album Now &amp; Then. Composed in the key of E, &quot;Yesterday \nOnce More&quot; preceded an &quot;Oldies Medley&quot; on the album, consisting of nine songs from the \n1960s. At the end of the song a motorcycle engine was heard to transition into the first \nsong of the medley: &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;. The motorcycle was mixed out on The Singles: 1969-1973 \ncompilation. However, very few copies of that particular version are on CD.\n\nThe song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number one on the easy listening \nchart, becoming their eighth number one on this chart in four years. Though not quite as celebrated \nas signature songs Close to You or We've Only Just Begun, the ballad is nonetheless the Carpenters \nbiggest selling record worldwide, becoming their best-selling single in the UK, peaking at #2. Richard \nCarpenter admitted on a recent Japanese Carpenters documentary that it is his favorite of all the songs \nhe's written. He has gone on to perform the instrumental version at concerts.\n\nAccording to Cash Box Magazine, on June 2, 1973, &quot;Yesterday Once More&quot; was the highest debut single, debuting \nat number 71. By August 4, it had reached number one.\n\n\nDisc one\n\n1.&quot;Yesterday Once More&quot; - 03:58 (Carpenter, Bettis)\n2.&quot;Superstar - 3.48 (Russell, Bramlett)\n3.&quot;Rainy Days and Mondays&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 (Williams, Nichols)\n4.&quot;(Want You) Back in My Life Again&quot; - 3:39 (Chater, Christian)\n5.&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; - 4:08 (Lennon/McCartney)\n6.&quot;Goodbye to Love&quot; - 3:54 (Carpenter, Bettis)\n7.&quot;Bless the Beasts and Children&quot; - 3:15 (Botkin, De Vorzon)\n8.&quot;It's Going to Take Some Time&quot; - 2:57 (King, Stern)\n9.&quot;Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft&quot; - 7:09 (Draper, Woloschuk)\n10.&quot;Sweet, Sweet Smile&quot; - 3:02 (Newton, Young)\n11.&quot;I Won't Last a Day Without You&quot; - 3:54 (Nichols, Williams)\n12.&quot;For All We Know&quot; - 2:31 (Griffin, Karlin, Wilson)\n13.&quot;Touch Me When We're Dancing&quot; - 3:20 (Bell, Skinner, Wallace)\n\nDisc two\n\n1.&quot;There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)&quot; - 3:03 (Reed, Stephens)\n2.&quot;This Masquerade&quot; - 4:53 (Russell)\n3.&quot;Hurting Each Other&quot; - 2:46 (Geld, Udell)\n4.&quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; - 2:47 (Bateman, Dobbins, Garrett, Gorman, Holland)\n5.&quot;I Need to Be in Love&quot; - 3:49 (Bettis, Carpenter, Hammond)\n6.&quot;Make Believe It's Your First Time&quot; - 4:07 (Morrison, Wilson)\n7.&quot;All You Get from Love Is a Love Song&quot; - 3:46 (Eaton)\n8.&quot;Top of the World&quot; - 3:00 (Bettis, Carpenter)\n9.&quot;Because We Are in Love (The Wedding Song)&quot; - 5:01 (Bettis, Carpenter)\n10.&quot;We've Only Just Begun&quot; - 3:04 (Nichols, Williams)\n11.&quot;Those Good Old Dreams&quot; - 4:12 (Bettis, Carpenter)\n12.&quot;Sing&quot; - 3:18 (Raposo)\n13.&quot;Only Yesterday&quot; - 3:46 (Bettis, Carpenter)\n14.&quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You&quot; - 3:40 (Bacharach, David)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caffea2defc579de37681faed4a71521e1bab9a9","amp;dn":"Carpenters+Yesterday+Once+More+%5B2CD%5D%5BMp3%5D%5B320kbs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caffea2defc579de37681faed4a71521e1bab9a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,255,234,45,239,197,121,222,55,104,31,174,212,167,21,33,225,186,185,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
