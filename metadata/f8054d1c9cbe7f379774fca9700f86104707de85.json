Following the release of the EP Back to the Known (1985), Bad Religion went on a temporary hiatus, then reunited with its original members and went to work on its first full-length studio album in five years.\n\nAlthough Suffer was not charted in Billboard, it is considered by many to be one of the best punk albums of the 1980s, as well as its follow-up No Control. After its release, Suffer quickly became Epitaph Records best seller and was the label's best-selling third album for a number of years, until the release of The Offspring's 1994 highly acclaimed album Smash. A plethora of third-wave punk bands cite this album as a major inspiration; NOFX's Fat Mike has called it &quot;the record that changed everything.&quot;\n\n**********Bit Rate: 256kbps**********\n\n\n#          Track Name                      Length\n_________________________________________________\n\n1. \t&quot;You Are (The Government)&quot;   \t    1:21\n2. \t&quot;1000 More Fools&quot;   \t            1:34\n3. \t&quot;How Much Is Enough                 1:22\n4. \t&quot;When?&quot;   \t                    1:38\n5. \t&quot;Give You Nothing&quot;   \t            2:00\n6. \t&quot;Land of Competition&quot;   \t    2:04\n7. \t&quot;Forbidden Beat&quot;   \t            1:56\n8. \t&quot;Best for You&quot;   \t            1:53\n9. \t&quot;Suffer&quot;   \t                    1:47\n10. \t&quot;Delirium of Disorder&quot;   \t    1:38\n11. \t&quot;Part II (The Numbers Game)&quot;        1:39\n12. \t&quot;What Can You Do?&quot;   \t            2:44\n13. \t&quot;Do What You Want&quot;   \t            1:05\n14. \t&quot;Part IV (The Index Fossil)&quot;        2:02\n15. \t&quot;Pessimistic Lines&quot;           \t    1:07\n\n\n**********PLEASE SEED**********","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8054d1c9cbe7f379774fca9700f86104707de85","amp;dn":"Bad+Religion+-+Suffer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8054d1c9cbe7f379774fca9700f86104707de85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,5,77,28,156,190,127,55,151,116,252,169,112,15,134,16,71,7,222,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
