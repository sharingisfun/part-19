Local loner, Michael Stone, carried out a brutal and frenzied hammer attack on the family and left them for dead. Lin and six year old Megan died from their injuries. Against all odds, eldest daughter, Josie, made a remarkable recovery. This horrific attack struck a cord with the nation. Three females walking down a country lane on their way home from school subjected to a relentless unprovoked assault. This devastating crime is told through the eyes of those closest to the tragedy, in particular, father and husband, Shaun Russell, who opens his heart about the tragic loss of his family.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/266/crimesthatshookbritainsz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/266/crimesthatshookbritainsz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1979 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 47mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:701 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/crimes-that-shook-britain-the-russell-murders-825294&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/crimes-that-shook-britain-the-russell-murders-825294&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20eadd2f990e5270c253d87020733dda0ebddf43","amp;dn":"History+Ch+Crimes+That+Shook+Britain+5of6+The+Russell+Murders+Xv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20eadd2f990e5270c253d87020733dda0ebddf43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,234,221,47,153,14,82,112,194,83,216,112,32,115,61,218,14,189,223,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
