He does lack one skill, however, as is revealed in his latest adventure, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just say that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an ability that would be useful in a story full of water.\n\nPlot\n\nA provincial magistrate, Dee arrives in the cosmopolitan capital, Luoyang, as it reels from a crisis. The imperial fleet has been destroyed by a sea monster, and in response the city fathers have decided to sacrifice a beautiful courtesan, Ruiji. (SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s played by a Hong Kong-based actress who calls herself Angelababy.) Whether the dragon has a taste for courtesans is unclear, but the possibility of human sacrifice does give the cartoonish story some grown-up urgency.\n\nSequestered in preparation for the ceremony, Ruiji is targeted for kidnapping by two different gangs of outlanders. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also visited by a menacing-looking water creature, one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more man than dragon. Dee and his new sidekick, a prison medic (Lin Gengxin), protect the young woman. Also in the mix is Yuchi (Feng Shaofeng), a red-haired capital magistrate who is sometimes DeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ally, sometimes his adversary.\n\nDee must battle attackers both human and supernatural, learn the tricks of supernatural medicine and periodically rescue Ruiji, all while placating the self-serving Empress Wu (Carina Lau, returning from the previous film). Eventually, of course, there will be a showdown with the ship-shredding dragon.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46a64642f243cc39e279d1952ab9122d1506ed86","amp;dn":"Young+Detective+Dee+-+Rise+of+the+Sea+Dragon.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46a64642f243cc39e279d1952ab9122d1506ed86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,166,70,66,242,67,204,57,226,121,209,149,42,185,18,45,21,6,237,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
