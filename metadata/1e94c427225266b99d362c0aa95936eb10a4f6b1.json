It follows the experiences of an unnamed protagonist struggling with insomnia. Inspired by his doctor's exasperated remark that insomnia is not suffering, he finds relief by impersonating a seriously ill person in several support groups. Then he meets a mysterious man named Tyler Durden and establishes an underground fighting club as radical psychotherapy.\n \nIn 1999, director David Fincher adapted the novel into a film of the same name, starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. The film acquired a cult following despite lower than expected box-office results. The film's prominence heightened the profile of the novel and that of Palahniuk.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e94c427225266b99d362c0aa95936eb10a4f6b1","amp;dn":"Fight+Club+%28pdf%2Bepub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e94c427225266b99d362c0aa95936eb10a4f6b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,148,196,39,34,82,102,185,157,54,44,10,169,89,54,235,16,164,246,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
