The great freedoms of the\nUnited States are no longer, as the once great nation has sealed off its\nborders and become a militarized police state, censoring all film, art,\nliterature, and communications. Even so, a small resistance force led by two\nrevolutionaries manages to fight the oppression. With full control over the\nmedia, the government attempts to quell the nation's yearning for freedom by\nbroadcasting a number of game shows on which convicted criminals fight for\ntheir lives. The most popular and sadistic of these programs is The Running\nMan, hosted by Damon Killian. When a peaceful protest of starving citizens\ngathers in Bakersfield, California, a police officer named Ben Richards is\nordered to fire on the crowd, which he refuses to do. Subdued by the other\nofficers, the attack is carried out, and Richards is framed for the murder\nof almost a hundred unarmed civilians. Following a daring jail break months\nlater, Richards is captured once again and forced to appear on The Running\nMan with three other convicts. With their help, he fights his way through a\ncadre of sadistic gladiators hunting them down through the ruins of a Los\nAngeles earthquake, but not promising Killian that he'll return to settle\nthe score when the show's host double-crosses him. In the meantime, the\ncontestants must search through the ruins for the resistance in the hopes\nof finally broadcasting the truth about the government.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n=&gt;-Maria Conchita Alonso.\n=&gt;-Yaphet Kotto.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Paul Michael Glaser.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre..........................: Action : Crime : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...................: 1987.\n=&gt;-Languages......................: English : German.\n=&gt;-File Size......................: 1.70 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...............: 2 414 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..................: 1h 40mn.\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...................: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.....................: 1280 x 720.\n=&gt;-Bit rate.......................: 2 200 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels.......................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate.......................: 111 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...............: 216 Kbps.\n\nAudio German.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels.......................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate.......................: 96 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...............: 208 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles.\n=&gt;-English.\n=&gt;-German.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbf13abbf73d03c7cdce17d779d5d92362a7e63d","amp;dn":"The+Running+Man+-+Arnold+Schwarzenegger+Eng+Ger+Subs+720p+%5BH264-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbf13abbf73d03c7cdce17d779d5d92362a7e63d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,241,58,187,247,61,3,199,205,206,23,215,121,213,217,35,98,167,230,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
