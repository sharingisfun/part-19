With each swift and untraceable kill, the tangled network of monsters responsible for the slaughter of 270 civilians in the Pan Am Lockerbie attack become increasingly aware that someone is hunting them. Rapp is given his next target, and finds the man asleep in his bed in Paris. In the split second it takes the bullet to leave RappÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s silenced pistol, the trap is sprung and he finds himself in the fight of his life. \n\nThe next morning, nine bodies are discovered in one of ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest hotelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½among them the Libyan oil minister. Back in Washington the finger-pointing begins in earnest as no one wants any part in what has become an international crisis and potential embarrassment for the CIA. RappÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s handlers have only one choiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½deny any responsibility for the incident and pray that their newest secret weapon stays that way. \n\nRapp must avoid capture or die quietly. One person in the group, however, is not prone to leaving such important things to chance. Rapp has become a liability, and Stan Hurley will not allow Rapp to be taken alive by the French authorities, even if it means killing him. Operating on his own and outside the control of his handlers, it will soon become clear that nothing is more dangerous than a wounded and cornered Mitch Rapp. \n\nIn FlynnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s newest page-turner, the stakes are higher than theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever been as Mitch Rapp embarks on the journey that will turn him into AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most deadly asset. The nonstop action in this shockingly realistic political thriller will keep your pulse pounding till the very end.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e648d13a262516a29b59f945fbb07973f2d5c36","amp;dn":"Kill+Shot+-+Vince+Flynn.mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e648d13a262516a29b59f945fbb07973f2d5c36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,100,141,19,162,98,81,106,41,181,159,148,95,187,7,151,63,45,92,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
