It contains a mixture of songs and instrumentals by YMO (including a humorous reworking of Archie Bell &amp; the Drells' &quot;Tighten Up&quot;), interspersed with comedy sketches. These sketches are performed by Snakeman Show in both Japanese and English, with YMO participating in some of them.\n\n Release history\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã…Â¾Multiplies was released in several formats worldwide. The original Japanese pressing came on 10&quot; vinyl. The United States pressing compiled tracks from both this record and from Solid State Survivor, which had not been released there, while dropping the comedy sketches. The United Kingdom released ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã…Â¾Multiplies with additional tracks culled from Yellow Magic Orchestra. All re-issues from 1999 onward reverted to the original Japanese tracklisting.\n\nThe tracks differ slightly between the Japanese and US versions: In the original release Nice Age has an abrupt ending and other tracks are crossfaded between the Snakeman Show sketches; in the US version these have clean intros and endings and Jingle 'YMO' is listed as part of the Nice Age track.\n\nRegion Date Label Format Catalog \nJapan 5 June 1980 Alfa Records 10&quot; LP YMO-1 \nUnited States 29 July 1980 A&amp;M Records LP SP4813 \nJapan 5 September 1980 Alfa LP (as above US version, with obi) ALR-28004 \n\nTrack listing\nJapan version\nSide one \n\n1. &quot;Jingle 'YMO'&quot;   Yellow Magic Orchestra 0:21 \n2. &quot;Nice Age&quot;   Chris Mosdell/Ryuichi Sakamoto/Yukihiro Takahashi 3:46 \n3. &quot;Snakeman Show&quot;   Snakeman Show 1:56 \n4. &quot;Tighten Up (Japanese Gentlemen Stand Up Please!)&quot;   Archie Bell/Billy Butler 3:41 \n5. &quot;Snakeman Show&quot;   Snakeman Show 2:05 \n6. &quot;Here We Go Again ~ Tighten Up&quot;   Bell/Butler 1:07 \n\nSide two \n\n1. &quot;Snakeman Show&quot;   Snakeman Show 1:26 \n2. &quot;Citizens of Science&quot;   Chris Mosdell/Sakamoto 4:29 \n3. &quot;Snakeman Show&quot;   Snakeman Show 2:08 \n4. &quot;Multiplies&quot;   Elmer Bernstein/Yellow Magic Orchestra 2:58 \n5. &quot;Snakeman Show&quot;   Snakeman Show 3:44 \n6. &quot;The End of Asia&quot;   Sakamoto 1:32 \n\nUS version\nSome pressings included &quot;Tighten Up&quot; as the opening track for Side A.\n\nSide one \n\n1. &quot;Nice Age&quot;   Chris Mosdell/Ryuichi Sakamoto/Yukihiro Takahashi 3:55 \n2. &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;   Chris Mosdell/Sakamoto 3:36 \n3. &quot;Rydeen&quot;   Takahashi 4:26 \n4. &quot;Day Tripper&quot;   Lennon/McCartney 2:40 \n\nSide two \n\n1. &quot;Technopolis&quot;   Sakamoto 4:14 \n2. &quot;Multiplies&quot;   Elmer Bernstein/Yellow Magic Orchestra 2:58 \n3. &quot;Citizens of Science&quot;   Chris Mosdell/Sakamoto 4:29 \n4. &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot;   Chris Mosdell/Takahashi 3:58 \n\n European version\nOn this pressing, the first &quot;Snakeman Show&quot; is actually &quot;Jingle 'YMO'&quot;, while the second &quot;Snakeman Show&quot; is the &quot;Japan is #1&quot; skit from the Japanese pressing.\n\nSide one \n\n1. &quot;Technopolis&quot;   Ryuichi Sakamoto 4:14 \n2. &quot;Absolute Ego Dance&quot;   Haruomi Hosono 4:37 \n3. &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;   Chris Mosdell/Sakamoto 3:36 \n4. &quot;Computer Game 'Theme from The Circus'&quot;   Yellow Magic Orchestra 1:48 \n5. &quot;Firecracker&quot;   Martin Denny 4:50 \n6. &quot;Computer Game 'Theme from The Invader'&quot;   Yellow Magic Orchestra 0:43 \n\nSide two \n\n1. &quot;Snakeman Show&quot;   Yellow Magic Orchestra 0:21 \n2. &quot;Nice Age&quot;   Chris Mosdell/Sakamoto/Yukihiro Takahashi 3:46 \n3. &quot;Multiplies&quot;   Elmer Bernstein/Yellow Magic Orchestra 2:58 \n4. &quot;Snakeman Show&quot;   Snakeman Show 2:05 \n5. &quot;Citizens of Science&quot;   Chris Mosdell/Sakamoto 4:29 \n6. &quot;Tighten Up (Japanese Gentlemen Stand Up Please!)&quot;   Archie Bell/Billy Butler 3:06 \n\nPersonnel\nRyuichi Sakamoto: keyboards, electronics, percussion, orchestration\nYukihiro Takahashi: vocals, drums, percussion, electronics\nHaruomi Hosono: Bass, electronics, keyboards, arrangements\nChris Mosdell: Lyrics\nHideki Matsutake: Computer programming\nSnakeman Show: Comedy sketches\nMakoto Ayukawa: Guitar on &quot;Day Tripper&quot; and &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot;\nSandii: Voices on &quot;Absolute Ego Dance&quot;\n\nReferences\n1.^ http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamag/album/nenkan1980_a.html\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcf70607273877e33693a6880f0427bee3f50e5d","amp;dn":"Yellow+Magic+Orchestra+%5B1980%5D+Xoo+Multiplies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcf70607273877e33693a6880f0427bee3f50e5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,247,6,7,39,56,119,227,54,147,166,136,15,4,39,190,227,245,14,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
