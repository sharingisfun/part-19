It didn't give you the date and it didn't give you specifics. It just spat out a sliver of paper upon which were printed, in careful block letters, the words DROWNED or CANCER or OLD AGE or CHOKED ON A HANDFUL OF POPCORN. It let people know how they were going to die.&quot; MACHINE OF DEATH tells thirty-four different stories about people who know how they will die. Prepare to have your tears jerked, your spine tingled, your funny bone tickled, your mind blown, your pulse quickened, or your heart warmed. Or better yet, simply prepare to be surprised. Because even when people do have perfect knowledge of the future, there's no telling exactly how things will turn out. Featuring stories by: Randall Munroe * Ben &quot;Yahtzee&quot; Croshaw * Tom Francis * Camille Alexa * Erin McKean * James L. Sutter * and many others. Featuring illustrations by: Kate Beaton * Kazu Kibuishi * Aaron Diaz * Jeffrey Brown * Scott C. * Roger Langridge * Karl Kerschl * Cameron Stewart * and many others.\n\n\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba1f9393b7fb03654ee47e581a28c4b0e5390d9","amp;dn":"Machine+of+Death%3A+A+collection+of+stories+about+people+who+know+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba1f9393b7fb03654ee47e581a28c4b0e5390d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,161,249,57,59,127,176,54,84,238,71,229,129,162,140,75,14,83,144,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
