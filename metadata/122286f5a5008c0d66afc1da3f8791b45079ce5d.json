Winter's saxophone accompaniment here is understated, though a bit staid. What makes this record so sweet is Lyra's gorgeous guitar and intimate vocals, as well as all the great songs he wrote. Sergio Mendes and Milton Banana sit in on piano and drums, respectively, and though Winter is slightly less swinging than the &quot;authentic&quot; bossa musicians, this is quite a nice little record... one of my favorite old-school bossa nova gems...\n\n(Review from Amazon.com)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:122286f5a5008c0d66afc1da3f8791b45079ce5d","amp;dn":"Paul+Winter+%26+Carlos+Lyra+-+The+Sound+of+Ipanema%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"122286f5a5008c0d66afc1da3f8791b45079ce5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,34,134,245,165,0,140,13,102,175,193,218,63,135,145,180,80,121,206,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
