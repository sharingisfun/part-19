I'm using Windows XP and Winamp to play everything and these play perfectly. Suggest you download just one episode to see if you have issues. If you do then just remember how much you paid for it and get on with your life.\n\nThe PC I'm using for seeding is rather secure so some might have problems connecting. Others don't so when they connect, you might be able to connect to them and leach that way. I'll be dropping my seed on this on or about Feb. 15, 2009.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3faff5bb19339c7ccac2d0c6e7f13901664e741f","amp;dn":"The+Addams+Family+%28DVDRips%29+season+2+%281965-66%29%28XviD.720x480%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3faff5bb19339c7ccac2d0c6e7f13901664e741f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,175,245,187,25,51,156,124,202,194,208,198,231,241,57,1,102,78,116,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
