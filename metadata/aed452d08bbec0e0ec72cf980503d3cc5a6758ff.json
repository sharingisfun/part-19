But knowing how to properly plan for an event, make resource agreements with other participants in the investigation, and implement a coordinating system within the agency is critical to proper case control in a department. Now in its second edition, Managing and Coordinating Major Criminal Investigations details a methodology that is adaptable to any existing record or control system.\n\nThis new edition features an expanded outline format, more detailed instructions, and updated case systems. It also reflects the introduction of new technology developed since the benchmark first edition. Designed so that users can determine the necessary requirements to meet their individual needs, the book aids in the thinking and direction required to accomplish this task. Decisionmakers in small and large agencies can tailor the system to their specifications, retaining flexibility to decide the applications, degree of implementation, and usage.\n\nFilled with concrete, specific guidelines and time-tested wisdom from a law enforcement veteran, this book provides police supervisors with the essential tools needed to improve or develop a systemic approach to the control of major investigations. More importantly, it helps to create the necessary mindsets required in supervisors to manage any major crime effectively.\n\n\nPaperback: 335 pages\nPublisher: CRC Press; 2 edition (December 2, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1439849226\nISBN-13: 978-1439849224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aed452d08bbec0e0ec72cf980503d3cc5a6758ff","amp;dn":"Managing+and+Coordinating+Major+Criminal+Investigations%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aed452d08bbec0e0ec72cf980503d3cc5a6758ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,212,82,208,139,190,192,224,236,114,207,152,5,3,211,204,90,103,88,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
