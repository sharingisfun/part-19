Everest in 1953 and a biography of her father, Dr Griffith Pugh, whose role was absolutely pivotal, yet mostly untold. As the expeditionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s physiological consultant, Pugh designed almost every aspect of the survival strategy for the expedition, the acclimatization program, the oxygen- and fluid-intake regime, the diet, the clothing and the high altitude boots. Without him and his work, the ascent of Everest would have been impossible.\n\n\n\nNotes: Have tested out chapter and other links in both file types on a Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model). I used the application Aldiko for the epub file, and Kindle for Android for the mobi file. On the desktop PC used Calibre for the epub and Kindle for PC for the mobi file.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:559b68320c2c14b1c5be3b2b94a33c2dcf548aa1","amp;dn":"Everest+The+First+Ascent+Harriet+Pugh+Tuckey+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"559b68320c2c14b1c5be3b2b94a33c2dcf548aa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,155,104,50,12,44,20,177,197,190,59,43,148,163,60,45,207,84,138,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
