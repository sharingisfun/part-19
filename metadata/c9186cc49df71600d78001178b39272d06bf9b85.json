(Wiley, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nNanotechnology is a progressive research and development topic with large amounts of venture capital and government funding being invested worldwide. Nano mechanics, in particular, is the study and characterization of the mechanical behaviour of individual atoms, systems and structures in response to various types of forces and loading conditions.\r\nThis text, written by respected researchers in the field, informs researchers and practitioners about the fundamental concepts in nano mechanics and materials, focusing on their modelling via multiple scale methods and techniques. The book systematically covers the theory behind multi-particle and nanoscale systems, introduces multiple scale methods, and finally looks at contemporary applications in nano-structured and bio-inspired materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9186cc49df71600d78001178b39272d06bf9b85","amp;dn":"Nano+Mechanics+and+Materials+-+Wing+Kam+Liu+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9186cc49df71600d78001178b39272d06bf9b85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,24,108,196,157,247,22,0,215,128,1,23,139,57,39,45,6,191,155,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
