All you have to do is burn to a disc and use on your modded wii. If you don't know how to burn to a disc, use Nero Rom Burner, and then use the &quot;Burn Image&quot; option. (Select lowest disc speed to prevent errors in the writing process).\n\nIf you guys like this one, and give feedback saying you do. Then i will post more (all being the NTSC - U). By the way,If the ISO isn't 4699979776 Bytes then ISO is no good or altered. The ones i put up will all be the exact same size, making it obvious that mine all will work perfectly. Happy downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51bba5628e1e725fd653acee4c4237ab2c4b5afd","amp;dn":"Dead+Rising%3A+Chop+Til+You+Drop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51bba5628e1e725fd653acee4c4237ab2c4b5afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,187,165,98,142,30,114,95,214,83,172,238,76,66,55,171,44,75,90,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
