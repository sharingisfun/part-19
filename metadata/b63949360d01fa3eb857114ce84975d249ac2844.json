In the wake of the Phoenix, the world has changed and is torn on exactly what Cyclops and his team of X-Men are - visionary revolutionaries or dangerous terrorists? Whatever the truth, Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magneto, and Magik are out in the world gathering up new mutants and redefining the name UNCANNY X-MEN.\n\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b63949360d01fa3eb857114ce84975d249ac2844","amp;dn":"Uncanny+X-Men+01+%282013%29%288+Covers+1440%2B2048px-HD%29%28Tarutaru-Novus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b63949360d01fa3eb857114ce84975d249ac2844","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,57,73,54,13,1,250,62,184,87,17,76,232,73,117,210,73,172,40,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
