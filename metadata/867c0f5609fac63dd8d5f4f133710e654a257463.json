In 1986, Schenker and vocalist Robin McAuley formed the McAuley Schenker Group, which lasted until 1993. After that, in 1996 the Michael Schenker Group was reformed.\r\n\r\nThe music is best described as mostly melodic hard rock with progressive undertones. Schenker is famous for his half-black, half-white Gibson Flying V and for his unorthodox approach to lead guitar. He is sponsored by Dean Guitars and is well known in the neo-classical genre.\r\n\r\n\r\n Albums In this Compilation\r\n\r\n    The Michael Schenker Group (1980)\r\n    MSG (1981)\r\n    Assault Attack (1982)\r\n    Built to Destroy (1983)\r\n    One Night at Budokan (1982) \r\n\r\nTrack listings\r\n\r\nAll songs written by Michael Schenker and others.\r\n\r\nThe Michael Schenker Group (1980)\r\n    \r\n    &quot;Armed and Ready&quot; -            4:05\r\n    &quot;Cry for the Nations&quot; -        5:08\r\n    &quot;Victim of Illusion&quot; -         4:41\r\n    &quot;Bijou Pleasurette&quot;  -         2:16\r\n    &quot;Feels Like a Good Thing&quot; -    3:44\r\n    &quot;Into the Arena&quot;            - 4:10\r\n    &quot;Looking Out from Nowhere&quot;  -  4:28\r\n    &quot;Tales of Mystery&quot; -           3:16\r\n    &quot;Lost Horizons&quot; -              7:04\r\n\r\n  MSG (1981)\r\n\r\n &quot;Are You Ready to Rock&quot;    \t 3:26\r\n &quot;Attack of the Mad Axeman&quot;   \t 4:17\r\n &quot;On and On&quot;   \t \t          4:41\r\n &quot;Let Sleeping Dogs Lie&quot;         5:21\r\n &quot;But I Want More&quot;   \t \t  6:56\r\n &quot;Never Trust a Stranger&quot;    \t 4:24\r\n &quot;Looking for Love&quot;   \t\t 4:03\r\n &quot;Secondary Motion&quot;               3:42 \r\n\r\nAssault Attack (1982)\r\n\r\n&quot;Assault Attack&quot; ,-        4:16\r\n&quot;Rock You to the Ground&quot;   5:48\r\n&quot;Dancer&quot;  -                4:41\r\n&quot;Samurai&quot;  -               5:16\r\n&quot;Desert Song&quot;  -           5:51\r\n&quot;Broken Promises&quot;           6:21\r\n&quot;Searching for a Reason&quot;   3:46\r\n&quot;Ulcer&quot;  -                 3:53\r\n\r\nBuilt to Destroy (1983)\r\n\r\n&quot;Rock My Nights Away&quot;   \t4:09\r\n&quot;I'm Gonna Make You Mine&quot;   \t4:18\r\n&quot;The Dogs of War&quot;   \t\t4:23\r\n&quot;Systems Failing&quot;   \t\t4:25\r\n&quot;Captain Nemo&quot;   \t \t3:22\r\n&quot;Still Love That Little Devil&quot;   3:24\r\n&quot;Red Sky&quot;   \t                 5:15\r\n&quot;Time Waits (For No One)&quot;   \t3:58\r\n&quot;Walk the Stage&quot;                5:55\r\n\r\nOne Night at Budokan (Live 1982)\r\n\r\n &quot;Armed and Ready&quot; -         6:20\r\n &quot;Cry for the Nations&quot;   -   5:32\r\n &quot;Attack of the Mad Axeman&quot; - 4:50\r\n &quot;But I Want More&quot;          - 5:24\r\n &quot;Victim of Illusion&quot;       - 6:18\r\n &quot;Into the Arena&quot;          - 4:45\r\n &quot;On and On&quot;                 5:32\r\n  Never Trust a Stranger&quot;  - 6:07\r\n  Let Sleeping Dogs Lie&quot;  - 7:18\r\n &quot;Courvoisier Concerto&quot;  - 3:42\r\n  Lost Horizons&quot;          - 7:22\r\n &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot;         - 5:30\r\n &quot;Are You Ready to Rock&quot; - 7:10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing Members For this compilation\r\n\r\nMichael Schenker - lead guitar (1979-1986, 1992â€“present)\r\nGary Barden (1980â€“1981, 1982-1984, 2008â€“2010)\r\nGraham Bonnet (1982)\r\nDerek St. Holmes, plus guitar (1983)\r\n\r\nKeyboards:\r\n\r\nDon Airey (session 1980, 2008, 2011)\r\nPaul Raymond, plus guitar (1980â€“1981, 2011)\r\nTommy Eyre (session 1982)\r\nAndy Nye (1982â€“1984)\r\n\r\nBass:\r\n \r\nMo Foster (session 1980)\r\nChris Glen (1980â€“1983, 2008â€“2009, 2010, 2011)\r\n\r\nDrums:\r\n\r\nSimon Phillips (1980, 2008, 2010, 2011)\r\nCozy Powell (1980â€“1982)\r\nTed McKenna (1983â€“1984, 2008)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:867c0f5609fac63dd8d5f4f133710e654a257463","amp;dn":"The+Michael+Schenker+Group+-1st.5+Original+Albums+1980-83+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"867c0f5609fac63dd8d5f4f133710e654a257463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,124,15,86,9,250,198,61,216,213,244,241,51,113,14,101,74,37,116,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
