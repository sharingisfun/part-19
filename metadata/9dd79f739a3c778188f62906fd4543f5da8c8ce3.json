In the first two volumes of his bestselling Liberation Trilogy, Rick Atkinson recounted how the American-led coalition fought through North Africa and Italy to the threshold of victory. Now he tells the most dramatic story of allÃ¢â‚¬â€the titanic battle for Western Europe.\nD-Day marked the commencement of the final campaign of the European war, and AtkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riveting account of that bold gamble sets the pace for the masterly narrative that follows. The brutal fight in Normandy, the liberation of Paris, the disaster that was Operation Market Garden, the horrific Battle of the Bulge, and finally the thrust to the heart of the Third ReichÃ¢â‚¬â€all these historic events and more come alive with a wealth of new material and a mesmerizing cast of characters. Atkinson tells the tale from the perspective of participants at every level, from presidents and generals to war-weary lieutenants and terrified teenage riflemen. When Germany at last surrenders, we understand anew both the devastating cost of this global conflagration and the enormous effort required to win the Allied victory.\nWith the stirring final volume of this monumental trilogy, AtkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accomplishment is manifest. He has produced the definitive chronicle of the war that unshackled a continent and preserved freedom in the West.\n\nGenre: History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd79f739a3c778188f62906fd4543f5da8c8ce3","amp;dn":"Guns_at_Last_Light__The_War_in_Western_Europe%2C_1944-1945%2C_The_-_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd79f739a3c778188f62906fd4543f5da8c8ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,215,159,115,154,60,119,129,136,246,41,6,253,69,67,245,218,140,140,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
