When the prime suspect is released without charge, RichardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suspicions are aroused. Investigating the mystery, Richard uncovers at the Metro-Centre mall a neo-fascist world whose charismatic spokesperson is whipping up the masses into a state of unsustainable frenzy. Riots frequently terrorize the complex, immigrant communities are attacked by hooligans, and sports events mushroom into jingoistic political rallies. In this gripping, dystopian tour de force, J.G. Ballard holds up a mirror to suburban mind rot, revealing the darker forces at work beneath the gloss of consumerism and flag-waving patriotism.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Impressively packed with brilliant apercus.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Observer)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Starred Review. Ballard (1930Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2009) creates a world reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange and V for Vendetta in this novel of suburban fascism... Ballard writes brilliantly about the nightmarish underside of modern life, and this novel makes us poignantly aware of the loss of his voice.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Kirkus Reviews)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ballard, paradoxically, with all his characters gripped by obsession and necessity, is one of the great novelists of freedom.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Financial Times)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Nobody ever hated the contemporary world with as much intensity and conviction as J.G. Ballard... In Kingdom Come, Ballard's latest batch of preapocalyptic savages are happily clad in freshly ironed soccer jerseys and getting ready to fight for the only thing they believe in anymore Ã¢â‚¬â€ shopping at the Metro-Centre...\n\n[T]here's a lot of irony in Ballard. If his late (and very funny) books sound peculiar to American ears, it's probably because of his very English tendency to play almost everything he says, however outrageous, at moderate to low volumes. Unlike the noisier, New Yorkerish avant-garde types who like to shock and awe their readers, Ballard doesn't shout or swear or get in your face. Even his most disturbing obscenities...are as mannered and concise and unimpassioned as a GPS device's soothing, digitally modulated voice describing how to reach the next gas station.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Scott Bradfield - New York Times Book Review) \n\n\n==============\nJames Graham &quot;J. G.&quot; Ballard (15 November 1930 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 19 April 2009) was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist.\n\nBallard came to be associated with the New Wave of science fiction early in his career with apocalyptic (or post-apocalyptic) novels such as The Drowned World (1962), The Burning World (1964), and The Crystal World (1966). In the late 1960s and early 1970s Ballard focused on an eclectic variety of short stories (or &quot;condensed novels&quot;) such as The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), which drew closer comparison with the work of postmodernist writers such as William S. Burroughs. \n\nThe literary distinctiveness of Ballard's work has given rise to the adjective &quot;Ballardian&quot;, defined by the Collins English Dictionary as &quot;resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in J. G. Ballard's novels and stories, especially dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments.&quot; The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry describes Ballard's work as being occupied with &quot;eros, thanatos, mass media and emergent technologies&quot;.\n===========================================================\nBook Details::\nISBN: 978-0871403193\nPages:135 in SumatraPdf\nPublisher:Liveright\t\nYear:2006\n===========================================================\nPart of JG Ballard collection\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:944b1fae4a70d6269c124d29b9a6dc76c22fcaa3","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Come+by+J+G+Ballard+%28EPUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"944b1fae4a70d6269c124d29b9a6dc76c22fcaa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,75,31,174,74,112,214,38,156,18,77,41,185,166,220,118,194,47,202,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
