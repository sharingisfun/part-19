It was released with 1967ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1970 (The Blue Album), a compilation of their greatest hits from 1967 to 1970. 1962ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1966 reached #3 in the UK and managed to reach #1 in the U.S. Cashbox albums chart. However, in the U.S. the official chart was administered by Billboard, where 1962ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1966 peaked at #3, while 1967ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1970 managed to meet the summit. This album was re-released in September 1993 charting at #3 in the UK. The album was compiled by Beatles manager Allen Klein, with his selections approved by the Beatles themselves. Even though the group had had success with cover versions of songs, most notably with &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, which made #2 on the Billboard charts, only songs composed by The Beatles themselves were included. It is recognised as the first Beatles compilation since their breakup on 31 December 1970. Both it and 1967ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1970 were produced by Apple/EMI at least partially in response to a bootleg compilation titled Alpha Omega, which had been sold on television the previous year\n\nAmazon.com Review By Bill Holdship - The closest the Beatles came to a greatest hits package, this document of the early part of their career features hit singles (in chronological order) and selected album tracks, running from &quot;Love Me Do&quot; through the groundbreaking Rubber Soul and Revolver albums. While this may be an excellent intro for beginners, real fans will never be content with only selections, especially when you're dealing with those aforementioned albums. Capitol packages the collection on two discs, copying the original vinyl version--but, of course, CDs hold more music than records did. Still, you do get 26 bona fide classics, so there's no real need to complain. -\n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Love Me Do\n[02] Please Please Me\n[03] From Me To You\n[04] She Loves You\n[05] I Want To Hold Your Hand\n[06] All My Loving\n[07] Can't Buy Me Love\n[08] A Hard Day's Night\n[09] And I Love Her\n[10] Eight Days A Week\n[11] I Feel Fine\n[12] Ticket To Ride\n[13] Yesterday\n\n\tDisc 01 Play Time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 00h:30m:58s\n\nDisc 02\n\n\n[01] Help!\n[02] You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\n[03] We Can Work It Out\n[04] Day Tripper\n[05] Drive My Car\n[06] Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\n[07] Nowhere Man\n[08] Michelle\n[09] In My Life\n[10] Girl\n[11] Paperback Writer\n[12] Eleanor Rigby\n[13] Yellow Submarine\n\n\tDisc 02 Play Time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 00h:31m:35s\n\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 01h:02m:33s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 158mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I- Tunes v9.0.1.8 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Quicktime Mpeg N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 19 April 1973 [05 October 1993 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ CD Release]\nRecord Company\t&gt; Apple EMI Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thebeatles.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thebeatles.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.oldielyrics.com/t/the_beatles.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.oldielyrics.com/t/the_beatles.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbdb4c71d694de377d2095ceb7783f4f8a6c94c9","amp;dn":"%5B1973%5D+1962-1966+%28Red+Album%29+-+The+Beatles+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbdb4c71d694de377d2095ceb7783f4f8a6c94c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,219,76,113,214,148,222,55,125,32,149,206,183,120,63,79,138,108,148,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
