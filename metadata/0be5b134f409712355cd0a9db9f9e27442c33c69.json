I have (tried) to modify them for it to work on Mountain Lion (Build 12E55 ONLY). Now, I'm not exactly sure if these will work or not. Unfortunately, my mac is the only mac I have with me at the moment. Let me know in the comments if it works, and if it doesn't, I will take the torrent down.\n\nInstructions:\n1.) Unzip the .zip file.\n2.) Drag the apps to your application folder.\n3.) Test them and leave a comment!\n\nEnjoy if they work, and if not...oh well!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be5b134f409712355cd0a9db9f9e27442c33c69","amp;dn":"Maps+and+iBooks+Apps+for+Mountain+Lion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be5b134f409712355cd0a9db9f9e27442c33c69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,229,177,52,244,9,113,35,85,205,10,157,185,249,226,116,66,195,60,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
