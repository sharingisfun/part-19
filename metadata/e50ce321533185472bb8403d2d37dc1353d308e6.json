Here the Schola Cantorum of the Saint Bavo cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, performs 31 songs from different times of the liturgical calendar. Amongst these the 7 songs from the Liturgia Defunctorum (the Mass of the Dead) are of the very best ever performed. The same goes for the advent- song 'Rorate Coelis'. More details on the choir, performers and conductor as well as the textes from the songs (in latin) are to be found in de included pdf- leaflet. All songs are in high quality flac files. Production dates back from 1988.
