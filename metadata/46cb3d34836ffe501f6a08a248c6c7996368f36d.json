Nominations are made to the Board of Trustees by past honorees and members of the center's national artists committee. For the 2004 Honors, recommendations came from Dan Aykroyd, Christine Baranski, Angela Bassett, Joshua Bell, Adrien Brody, Dave Brubeck, Cy Coleman, Benicio Del Toro, Michael Douglas, Suzanne Farrell, Renee Fleming, Morgan Freeman, Rosemary Harris, Paloma Herrera, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Nathan Lane, Yo-Yo Ma, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep and Pinchas Zukerman. The awards are given at a United States Department of State dinner held the night before the annual Honors Gala at the Kennedy Center Opera House. A White House reception is also given in their honor. The ceremony is recorded during the first weekend of December and is not telecast live. Edited versions are currently shown on CBS.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46cb3d34836ffe501f6a08a248c6c7996368f36d","amp;dn":"The.Kennedy.Center.Honors.2011.HDTV.XviD-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46cb3d34836ffe501f6a08a248c6c7996368f36d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,203,61,52,131,111,254,80,31,106,8,162,72,198,199,153,99,104,243,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
