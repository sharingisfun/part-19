Democracy Now!'s War and Peace Report provides the audience with access to people and perspectives rarely heard in the U.S.corporate-sponsored media, including independent and international journalists, ordinary people from around the world who are directly affected by U.S. foreign policy, grassroots leaders and peace activists, artists, academics and independent analysts. In addition, Democracy Now! hosts real debatesâ€“debates between people who substantially disagree, such as between the White House or the Pentagon spokespeople on the one hand, and grassroots activists on the other.\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now!\r\nThursday, May 12, 2016\r\n\r\nRemembering Michael Ratner, Pioneering Lawyer Who Fought for Justice from Attica to GuantÃ¡namo\r\n\r\nJulian Assange: Michael Ratner was a &quot;Campaigner for Justice&quot; from Guatemala to Palestine\r\n\r\nSuing Dictators Around the World: A Look at How Michael Ratner Helped Reshape Human Rights Law\r\n\r\nSupport independent news! \nhttp://www.democracynow.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6999d5aba834d46b1f774bb2074e20e63b69f28","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now%21+2016-05-12+-+RIP+Michael+Ratner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6999d5aba834d46b1f774bb2074e20e63b69f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,153,157,90,186,131,77,70,177,247,116,187,32,116,226,14,99,182,159,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
