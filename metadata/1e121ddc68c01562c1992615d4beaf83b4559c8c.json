But the interest on the part of comics fans was so great, the super-team was brought back time and time again, in the majority of Superman Family titles.  Eventually, demand grew so strong the Legion of Super-Heroes was awarded its own continuing series.\n\nWhile quite a number of significant Legionnaires made their first appearances throughout the earliest years - Lightning Lad, Saturn Girl, Cosmic Boy, Sun Boy, Phantom Girl, Chameleon Boy, Triplicate Girl, Bouncing Boy, Star Boy, Matter-Eater Lad, Shrinking Violet, and Ultra Boy - the membership roster continued to grow ... and indeed, continues to grow to this day.\n\nUnder the direction of editor Mort Weisinger, these early Legion of Super-Heroes stories were produced by much of the Who's Who of Superman Family writers and artists of the 1950s and 1960s: Otto Binder and Al Plastino (who produced the initial Legion appearance in Adventure Comics #247), George Papp, Jim Mooney, John Forte, Curt Swan, Sheldon Moldoff, and George Klein.  The majority of Legion appearances during these early years came from the typewriter of the writer who started it all: Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel.\n\nThis first volume of The Legion of Super-Heroes Archives includes, in their entirety, all of the significant apperances of the teenaged super-team prior to the establishment of the ongoing series, as wel as the first half-dozen stories in the regular series - culminating with one of the most significant comic book stories ever published.\n\nAlong with The Superman Archives, The Batman and Dark Knight Archives, The All Star Archives, The Justice League Archives, and The Shazam! Archives, The Legion of Super-Heroes Archives provides the definitive collection of some of the most important ongoing series in comic book history.\n\nContains the following issues originally published in single magazine form as Adventure Comics #247, 267, 282, 290, 293, 300-305, Action Comics #267, 276, 287, 289, Superboy #86, 89, 98, Superman #147, and Superman Annual #4.\n\nThanks goes to Tol EressÃƒÂ«a for this release.\n\nThe Legion of Super-Heroes Archives Vol 2: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8578662&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8578662&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
