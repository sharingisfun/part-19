Released in Japan on March 3, 2010, it contains remixes of the songs from her first studio album, The Fame (200, and her third extended play, The Fame Monster (2009). A revised version of the tracklist was prepared for release in additional markets, beginning with Mexico on May 3, 2010. A number of recording artists have produced the songs, including Pet Shop Boys, Passion Pit and The Sound of Arrows. The remixed versions feature both uptempo and downtempo compositions, with altered vocals from Gaga.  The album received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, but some noted how Gaga was able to sell the songs from The Fame in new and novel ways. It reached the top of charts in Greece and the Dance/Electronic Albums chart of Billboard magazine in the United States. In other nations, The Remix charted within the top ten in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia region), Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the Billboard 200 chart of United States, while reaching the top-twenty in others. It was certified platinum in Japan and Brazil and received gold certification in Belgium and Russia.
