The two became fast friends, and melded their seemingly divergent stylesÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶Kubek a rocking and fierce picker and slider, King a jazz-inflected chorder (who could also solo with flaming electricity)ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶into one of the most potent guitar combinations the Southwest had ever produced. Kubek explains the relationship succinctly: ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£I pull the blues out of him, and he pulls the jazz out of me. Bnois knows so much about jazz itÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s amazing.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ The bandÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Alligator Records debut, 2008ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Blood Brothers, brought the long-time musicians to their largest audience yet and earned the band accolades all across the country. The Chicago Sun-Times declared, ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Genuine houserockinÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ bluesÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âªthey boogie till the break of day.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ Allmusic described the album as ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£tough, robust, soul-blues that is as hot as theyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve ever gotten in the studio. Impressive.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥\n\nWith &quot;Have Blues, Will Travel&quot;, they take another giant step forward. Kubek and King wrote or co-wrote all twelve songs, and, along with their road-tested rhythm section, they ignite a blues fire with enough heat to fuel an all-night party. The chemistry between KubekÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s blistering fretwork and KingÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s savvy vocals and unpredictable, multifaceted guitar work creates a roadhouse blend of muscular blues-rock, hip-shaking shuffles and slow-burning blues that is simply impossible to resist. Each song is infused with deep, from-the-heart musicianship, carefully crafted, true-to-life lyrics and delivered with the occasional wry smile. King calls Have Blues, Will Travel the best record the band has ever made.\n\n01. Have Blues, Will Travel\n02. Got You Out Of My Blood\n03. Out Of Body, Out Of Mind\n04. RU4 Real?\n05.
