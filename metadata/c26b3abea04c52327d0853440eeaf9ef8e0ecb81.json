Since then, Lemar has become the most successful black British soul artist of our time, commandeering the UKs radio airwaves with the hit singles 50/50, Dance (With U), If Theres Any Justice and Its Not That Easy. With 3 top ten UK albums, Lemar has sold well over 2 million albums, and most notably been awarded 2 MOBO Awards and 2 BRIT Awards. \nLemars latest musical offering The Reason, is set to capture an even wider audience, and keep him on the path as one of Britains leading solo artists. He spent the last two years crafting his new LP, recording in Los Angeles, Miami and Sweden.\n\n\n\n\nAlbum/Single: If She Knew (Radio Edit) - Single\n\nMusical Genre: R&amp;B\n\nAuthors: Lemar\n\nYear Released: 2008\n\nFile format: MP3 LAME 3.98\n\nQuality: 320 Kbps STEREO \n\n\nWith Covers + Lyrics\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01 If She Knew (Radio Edit) - 03:29   -  8 MB\n\n\nPlz Seed\n\nEnjoy\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/i.tunes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/i.tunes&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c26b3abea04c52327d0853440eeaf9ef8e0ecb81","amp;dn":"Lemar+-+If+She+Knew+%28Radio+Edit%29+%5BSingle%5D%5B2008%5D-+320kbps-+I.Tune","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c26b3abea04c52327d0853440eeaf9ef8e0ecb81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,107,58,190,160,76,82,50,125,8,83,68,14,234,249,239,142,14,203,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
