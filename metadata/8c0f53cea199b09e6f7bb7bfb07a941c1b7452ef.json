It was formed by Richie Furay and Jim Messina following the demise of their band Buffalo Springfield in 1968. Although the band was considered highly innovative and survived a number of personnel changes, it achieved only limited commercial success during its lifetime, which ended when the group broke up in 1984. Since then, some of the members have &quot;reformed&quot; Poco in various groupings.\n\nRose Of Cimarron is the 11th album by the country rock band Poco. Former Loggins &amp; Messina sax/fiddle player Al Garth steps in for a short period to cut this album, creating very strong, enjoyable, and (considered by some) under-appreciated music. A small but significant number of Poco fans find this to be the group's best album. The title track becomes a signature song for the group.\n\nPaul Cotton - guitar, vocals \nRusty Young - steel guitar, guitar, vocals \nTimothy B.
