Anything that benefited production - that benefited me and benefited my wallet - I'd do it.&quot;\n\nThe sales force at Ameriquest Mortgage took this philosophy to heart. They watched the Hollywood white-collar-crime flick &quot;Boiler Room&quot; as a training tape, studying how to pitch overpriced deals to unsuspecting home owners. They learned how to forge signatures on mortgage paperwork and create fake documents in &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; operations they dubbed &quot;The Lab&quot; or &quot;The Art Department.&quot;\n\nIn this stunning narrative, award-winning reporter Michael W.
