It has sections on statistical physics, equilibrium and transport properties of fluids, liquid crystals, complex fluids, polymers, chaos, fluid dynamics, plasma physics, classical physics, and computational physics. In addition, the journal features sections on two rapidly growing areas: biological physics and granular materials.\n\n=========================================================================\n\n\nPhysical Review E 1993-2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d55508d49e6873b42abbb01c651b2ff2c54d221","amp;dn":"APS-+Physical+Review+E+1993-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d55508d49e6873b42abbb01c651b2ff2c54d221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,85,80,141,73,230,135,59,66,171,187,1,198,81,178,255,44,84,210,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
