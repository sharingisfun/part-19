Now she finds herself torn between two loyalties. When sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s asked to apprehend her best friend and partner, she must choose to follow her friend or the law.\nAs these three struggle to save themselves, they will soon discover a string of conspiracies that threatens not only their lives, but everything they think they know.\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Control three characters - trance addict Latha Sesame (and her internet alter ego - Mandala), grizzled cop Charlie Regis, and tech-savvy detective Max Lao.\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Explore a futuristic, cyberpunk city (and its digital counterpart in virtual reality)\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Original soundtrack and full voice-acting\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½DVD-style commentary and bloopers\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€”ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/technobabylon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/technobabylon&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75716f5d7fabefe5b19075496c6b6343e74d2652","amp;dn":"Technobabylon+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75716f5d7fabefe5b19075496c6b6343e74d2652","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,113,111,93,127,171,239,229,177,144,117,73,108,107,99,67,231,77,38,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
