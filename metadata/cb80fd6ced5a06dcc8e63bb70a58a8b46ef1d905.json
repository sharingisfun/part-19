I will make another try in maybe a month from now at best with a new album. I'm sorry, but the only one you can blame is probably yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday I seed the third out of 7 Depeche Mode albums I currently have as Flac. For the upcoming week there'll be one new Depeche album every day. So stay tuned =)\n\nNote that FLAC is NOT a lossy format such as Mp3s which might injur your HiFi equipment badly. FLAC is nothing but the best and without all the DRM enabled crap Apple and Microsoft push out these days.\n\nIf you don't know about FLAC or why it is the future, head over to http://flac.sf.net and get convinced yourself.\n_____________________\nDepeche Mode - Music for the Masses (1987)\n\n\nTracklist\n\n01.

As for the music the masses got this time around, the opening cut &amp;quot;Never Let Me Down Again&amp;quot; started things off wonderfully: a compressed guitar riff suddenly slamming into a huge-sounding percussion/keyboard/piano combination, anchored to a constantly repeated melodic hook, ever-building synth/orchestral parts at the song's end, and one of Gahan's best vocals (though admittedly singing one of Gore's more pedestrian lyrics). It feels huge throughout, like they taped Depeche recording at the world's largest arena show instead of in a studio. Other key singles &amp;quot;Strangelove&amp;quot; and the (literally) driving &amp;quot;Behind the Wheel&amp;quot; maintained the same blend of power and song skill, while some of the quieter numbers such as &amp;quot;The Things You Said&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I Want You Now&amp;quot; showed musical and lyrical intimacy could easily co-exist with the big chart-busters. Add to that other winners like &amp;quot;To Have and to Hold,&amp;quot; with its Russian radio broadcast start and dramatic, downward spiral of music accompanied by Gahan's subtly powerful take on a desperate Gore love lyric, and the weird, wonderful choral closer &amp;quot;Pimpf,&amp;quot; and Depeche's massive success becomes perfectly clear.\n\n\nExtraction Info\n\nExtracted: EAC\nUsed drive: Lite-on LTR-52327S   Adapter: 1  ID: 0\nRead mode: Secure with NO C2, accurate stream, disable cache\nRead offset correction: 6\nOverread into Lead-In and Lead-Out: Yes\n\nUsed output format: Internal WAV Routines\n                     44.100 Hz; 16 Bit; Stereo\n\nOther options:\n    Fill up missing offset samples with silence: No\n    Delete leading and trailing silent blocks: No\n    Native Win32 interface for Win NT &amp;amp; 2000\n\nConverted: Converted: flac - Command-line FLAC encoder/decoder version 1.1.0 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002,2003  Josh Coalson\n\nLog, FLAC and WAV cue and playlist, FLAC fingerprint\n\n\n******************************************** \n\nPlease remember to upload as much as you download\n\n\n...::BE FAIR AND SHARE::... \n\n********************************************\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb80fd6ced5a06dcc8e63bb70a58a8b46ef1d905","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Music+For+The+Masses+%281987%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb80fd6ced5a06dcc8e63bb70a58a8b46ef1d905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,128,253,108,237,90,6,220,200,230,59,183,10,88,168,180,110,241,217,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
