In Ron PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rEVOLution, Brian Doherty, a senior editor at Reason magazine and Reason.com, documents the meteoric rise of Paul from relative obscurity to national prominence, and examines the fanatically devoted political movement that has arisen around him. Based on original reporting, Ron PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rEVOLution is a remarkable portrait of an extraordinary man who has become a hero to a rising generation of cross-partisan young activists.\n\nAbout the author:\nBRIAN DOHERTY is a senior editor at Reason magazine and Reason.com.
