The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman MelvilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the Heart of the SeaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reveals the encounterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harrowing aftermath, as the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down. Based on the book In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex by Nathaniel Philbrick.\n\nDirector: Ron Howard\n\nWriters: Charles Leavitt, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver\n\nActors: Chris Hemsworth, Benjamin Walker, Cillian Murphy, Tom Holland, Jordi MollÃƒÂ¡, Ben Whishaw, Brendan Gleeson\n\nGenre: Action and Adventure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:945550a49dc98aae5bf60dbb9a48a274352ffbc8","amp;dn":"In+the+Heart+of+the+Sea.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%232+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"945550a49dc98aae5bf60dbb9a48a274352ffbc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,85,80,164,157,201,138,174,91,246,13,187,154,72,162,116,53,47,251,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
