Seeking new avenues for expression, Morris added\nupright bass to his instrumental arsenal in 2000. Since then, he has split his\ntime between leading his own ensembles as a guitarist and playing bass as a\nsideman with fellow artists Rob Brown, Whit Dickey, Steve Lantner, Daniel Levin,\nand Matthew Shipp.\n\nHigh Definition is a paradigm shift for Morris; this is his first session\nleading an ensemble as a bassist. Joined by longstanding drummer Luther Gray,\nMorris enjoys the steadfast support of a like-minded veteran. With the animated\nfront-line of cornetist Taylor Ho Bynum and saxophonist Allan Chase, they offer\na varied program of piano-less quartet traditions; vibrant West Coast styled\narrangements and folksy Ornette-ish lyricism alternate with probing,\nexperimental detours that border on Ayler-esque cacophony.\n\nMorris' expansive writing straddles the tenuous line between inside and outside\naesthetics with graceful fluidity, allowing ample solo space for each member of\nthe quartet. With their infectiously knotty themes, harmonic sophistication, and\nlilting syncopation, &quot;Skeleton,&quot; &quot;Land Mass,&quot; and &quot;All-In-One&quot; feature ebullient\nmelodies, rich chord changes, and spry rhythmic patterns. Tunes like &quot;Morning\nGroup,&quot; &quot;Topics,&quot; and &quot;Super Spot&quot; head further out, embracing fluctuating\ntempos and unfettered polyphony.\n\nAn invigorating front-line voice, Bynum's blustery excursions evoke every aspect\nof the jazz tradition, from crisp hard-bop precision to elliptical cadences that\nbristle with pungent slurs, whinnies, and growls. An incisive conceptualist, his\ncoruscating smears on &quot;Land Mass&quot; and &quot;The Air Has Color&quot; are both caustic and\nstrangely tuneful. His rousing thematic variations on &quot;Topics&quot; reveal masterful\ntechnical virtuosity while his muted musings on the dulcet tone poem &quot;Bearing&quot;\nreflect a composer's sense of restraint.\n\nA deft and under-sung multi-instrumentalist, Chase's kaleidoscopic contributions\nmake him a perfect foil for Bynum's earthy elicitations. His baritone resounds\nwith pneumatic muscularity on &quot;Skeleton&quot; and &quot;All-In-One,&quot; while his alto veers\nfrom circuitous fervor on &quot;Topics&quot; to acerbic volatility on &quot;Morning Group.&quot; He\ndemonstrates a lyrical streak on &quot;Bearing&quot; and &quot;The Air Has Color,&quot; unfurling\nsinuous soprano fragments.\n\nMorris' elastic melodic contours and Gray's impeccable timing weave a mosaic of\neffervescent momentum as their finely honed conversational interplay provides\ndirection to even the most nebulous passages. Sounding confident and inspired,\nMorris solos on almost every tune, unveiling a robust tone and supple\nphrasing. Gray demonstrates a wide dynamic range, veering from the roiling\nassault of &quot;Super Spot&quot; to lithe percussive shading on &quot;Bearing.&quot;\n\nHigh Definition opens a promising new chapter for Morris as a bandleader. No\nlonger limited in his choice of instrumentation as an ensemble leader, this\nradiant session reveals new vistas for exploration from one of the most creative\nminds of his generation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d3db794256bee31e67934e52b4d7a0dbf2ee785","amp;dn":"Joe+Morris+Bass+Quartet+-+High+Definition+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d3db794256bee31e67934e52b4d7a0dbf2ee785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,61,183,148,37,107,238,49,230,121,52,229,43,77,122,13,191,46,231,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
