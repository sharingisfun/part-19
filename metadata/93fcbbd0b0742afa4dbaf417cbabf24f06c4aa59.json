Audio says 5.1, but indeed is not real 5.1.\nTo check with the md5, you have to put it into the VIDEO_TS folder.\n\n\nInfo: this is a great compilation. I know it has been shared previously on Savaje Jaw, but would be nice for the new generation. Comes with a pair of things that are quite rare\n\n1) Ivor Novello Awards: David was awarded for Best Original Song Space oddity, which he performed that night accompanied by the Les Reed Orchestra. The event was transmitted live via satellite to over 60 closed-circuit outlets in America, including New York's Carnegie Hall. It was also seen in France, Spain, Australia, Holland and Venezuela, but not Britain, where it was broadcast live on Radio 1 and 2 at 10pm-11.30pm.)\n\n2) Very early promo film for Luv Ice Cream\n\nThe real lineage for me is a mistery.\nIf you look in the menu and in the first song, in fact says &quot;The Rare, The Live, The Best&quot;, and also &quot;3logy production&quot;. In fact the DVD starts with a brief intro that also says 3logy.\nThat means the brazilian magazine got this DVD from somwhere and made a different package.\n\nAt the end of Station to Station says &quot;Part 2 is comming soon&quot;...so maybe the same person made part 2, but changed for the second part the name of the compilation.\n\nMy humble opinion is R B &amp; P is simply a re-packaging of a boot DVD called TR, TL, TB.\nThat's why I stated the real name of this DVD above, and how should be really called.\n\n\nContents:\n\n- Let me sleep beside you (Promo from Love you till Tuesday session, London 1969)\n- Space oddity (Ivor Novello Awards, 1970)\n- Oh!You pretty things (Alternate track from the Old Grey Whistle Test, London, 1972)\n- Ziggy Stardust (Santa Monica, rare split promo, 1972)\n- Sorrow (with Amanda Lear, promo from the 1980 Floor Show, London, 1973)\n- I've got you babe (duet with Marianne Faithful, 1980 Floor Show, London, 1973) - My death (Hammersmith Odeon, London, 3/7/1973)\n- 1984 (Dick Cavett Show, New York, 1974)\n- Footstompin (Dick Cavett Show, New York, 1974)\n- &quot;Heroes&quot; (The Bing Crosby Christmas Show, New York, 1977)\n- Little drummer boy / Peace on Earth (The Bing Crosby Christmas Show, New York,1977)\n- &quot;Heroes&quot; (Earl's Court, London, 1978)\n- Alabama song (Musikladen, Bremen, 1978)\n- Boys keep swinging (The Kenny Everett Show, London, 1979)\n- Space oddity (The Kenny Everett Show, London, 1979)\n- The man who sold the world (Saturday Night Live, New York, 1979)\n- TVC15 (Saturday Night Live, New York, 1979)\n- Boys keep swinging (Saturday Night Live, New York, 1979)\n- Station to station (From the motion picture Christiane F., filmed in New York, 1980) \nBonus:\n- The image (Rare early B/W film, featuring David Bowie and Michael Byrne) \n-Very early promo film for Luv Ice Cream (featuring David Bowie)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93fcbbd0b0742afa4dbaf417cbabf24f06c4aa59","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+-+Rare%2C+Precious+%26amp%3B+Beautiful+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93fcbbd0b0742afa4dbaf417cbabf24f06c4aa59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,252,187,208,176,116,42,250,77,186,244,23,203,171,242,79,6,196,170,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
