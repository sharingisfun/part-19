Spanning 1976 to 1993, this U.K.-originated, double-disc retrospective ranges from the Motown-inspired, '70s soul nuggets that garnered Ocean fame throughout Europe; to his global, crossover smashes from the '80s; and finally, several entries from his sole '90s album, Time to Move On. Disc One is comprised strictly of the 80s hits, including uptempo entries like &quot;When the Going Gets Tough (The Tough Get Going),&quot; &quot;Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car,&quot; &quot;Loverboy,&quot; and &quot;Caribbean Queen,&quot; as well as the ballads &quot;Suddenly,&quot; &quot;There'll Be Sad Songs (to Make You Cry),&quot; and &quot;The Colour of Love.&quot; Disc Two hones in on the earlier U.K. hits like &quot;Love Really Hurts Without You,&quot; &quot;Red Light,&quot; and &quot;Stop Me,&quot; but also includes the 90s tracks, as well as Ocean's first bona fide U.S. hit: the early-80s R&amp;B radio staple, &quot;Nights (Feel Like Getting Down).&quot; Oddly, the song from which this collection culls its acronymic title, &quot;Love Is Forever,&quot; is sandwiched in between these. One of Ocean's more underrated nuggets, it's a moving ballad from the singer's 1986 Love Zone set that made the U.S. top-20, but never quite achieved the &quot;classic&quot; status of &quot;Suddenly.&quot;  Though the sequencing of tracks is not always chronologically consistent, the strongpoint of this set is that tunes are continually enjoyable and versatile. Ocean's gregarious voice is a steady, listener-friendly presence, and he and his co-writers have crafted easily accessible and emotionally authentic compositions. The melodies are occasionally derivative -- &quot;Suddenly&quot; bears a noticeable similarity to Lionel Richie's &quot;Hello,&quot; while &quot;Get Outta My Dreams&quot; is reminiscent of The Rolling Stones' &quot;Get off My Cloud&quot;.&quot; Conversely, tunes like &quot;Nights (Feel Like Getting Down)&quot; and &quot;When the Going Gets Tough&quot; boost unique arrangements that others emulated. Another nice feature of this package is the inclusion of relatively in-depth liner notes, which are insightful, if sometimes erroneous. They claim, for instance, that Ocean's first release was his 1974 effort with Scorched Earth; but in fact, he had recorded in 1971 under his real name, Les Charles. All in all, L.I.F.E. is a nicely assimilated package that provides a well-rounded view of Ocean's international impact as a singer and songwriter.\nAll Music Review by Justin Kantor  \n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)\n[02] When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going\n[03] Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car\n[04] Suddenly\n[05] There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)\n[06] The Long And Winding Road\n[07] Loverboy\n[08] Tear Down These Walls\n[09] The Colour Of Love\n[10] Mystery Lady\n[11] Love Zone\n[12] Calypso Crazy\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 00h:51m:07s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Love Really Hurts Without You\n[02] Nights (Feel Like Gettin' Down)\n[03] Red Light Spells Danger\n[04] Are You Ready\n[05] Love Is Forever\n[06] L.O.D.
