Mosley's outstanding studio work with such artists as Tupac Shakur and E-40 speaks for itself. &quot;Mike and I really like and respect each other,&quot; TQ acknowledged. &quot;He's very serious about his work, like I am. By motivating each other, we both gave my project 110 percent.&quot;\n\n&quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;, a Mosley/Ty Howard produced track, is based on a true story about a woman shot by a drive-by bullet meant for her man; it's followed by &quot;The Comeback&quot;, a soul-searing track detailing the violent revenge wreaked on the shooter. &quot;Darling Mary&quot; is a playful ode to urban life's blunted reality; &quot;When I Get Out&quot;, a pulsating ballad between TQ and Ericka Yancey, about an incarcerated brother's insecurity when it comes to his lover on the outside.\n\nA horrifying drug-related incident from TQ's past was the source of &quot;Remember Melinda&quot;; &quot;Gotta Make That Money&quot; is a contemporary hustlers theme song, featuring a guest rap by E-40. &quot;The bottom line,&quot; TQ states, &quot;is that this album is about my life, the lives of the people that are close to me, and those that influenced me.&quot;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.
