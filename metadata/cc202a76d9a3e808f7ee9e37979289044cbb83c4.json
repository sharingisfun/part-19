Subject to a clandestine hearing, his crime remains a closely guarded secret.\n\n2014:\n\nTwo bodies are found in a London art gallery - stripped naked, necks bound with wire and legs obscenely contorted. They are twin brothers - successful art dealers - their brutal murder linked to the mysterious disappearance of two paintings by the master Caravaggio.\n\nInvestigators are confounded, and it falls to art expert Gil Eckhart to identify the killer before he slays again. But as the search for clues takes him from the glamorous skyline of New York to the fetid catacombs of Palermo, Eckhart finds that in the high-stakes world of art, good and evil are often tarred with the same, blood-soaked, brush.\n\nAuthor:\n\nAlex Connor is also known as Alexandra Connor and she has written a number of historical novels. This is her first crime thriller. She is an artist, and has worked in the art world for many years. Alex is also a motivational speaker and is regularly featured on television and BBC radio. She lives in Sussex.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc202a76d9a3e808f7ee9e37979289044cbb83c4","amp;dn":"The+Caravaggio+Conspiracy+%282014%29+Alex+Connor+%28multi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc202a76d9a3e808f7ee9e37979289044cbb83c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,32,42,118,217,163,232,8,247,238,158,55,151,146,137,4,76,187,131,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
