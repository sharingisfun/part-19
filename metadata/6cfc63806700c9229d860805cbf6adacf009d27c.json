At the end of 2008 -- after various lineup changes took place on bass and drums -- Lower Than Atlantis released their debut EP, Bretton. Clocking in at under 20 minutes and featuring eight tracks, the breakneck melodic hardcore punk sound of the EP would signal the direction of their 2010 debut album, Far Q. With the addition of full-time members Eddy Thrower (drums) and Declan Hart (bass), the band returned to the studio to record its sophomore release, 2011's World Record. Taking on a more alternative rock sound inspired by the likes of Foo Fighters and Jimmy Eat World, the album signaled the band's continued evolution from hardcore punk to melodic indie rock. Signing to Island Records at the beginning of 2012, the band released its third album, Changing Tune, in October of that year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cfc63806700c9229d860805cbf6adacf009d27c","amp;dn":"Lower+Than+Atlantis+%28Deluxe%29+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cfc63806700c9229d860805cbf6adacf009d27c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,252,99,128,103,0,201,34,157,134,8,5,203,246,173,172,240,9,210,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
