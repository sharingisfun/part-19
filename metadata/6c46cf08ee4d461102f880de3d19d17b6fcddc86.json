Sheridan Le Fanu, the celebrated 19th Century Irish writer best known for the oft-filmed lesbian vampire short story Carmilla (1872). This adaptation of The Wyvern Mystery was conducted for tv by the BBC. The teleplay was written by David Pirie, an author who was written two excellent works on the horror film Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A Heritage of Horror: The English Gothic Cinema, 1946-1972 (1973) and The Vampire Cinema (1976) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as well as a number of well worthwhile works for British television such as Somerset MaughamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spy drama Ashenden (1991), the Mad Cow Disease thriller Natural Lies (1992), the adaptation of Wilkie CollinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Gothic drama The Woman in White (1997), the tv series Murder Rooms (2000-1), which postulates that Sherlock HolmesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ creator Arthur Conan Doyle acted as a detective, as well as The Strange Case of Sherlock Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle (2005), which turns Conan DoyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biography into a Holmesian-type mystery.\nDirector Alex Pillai pumps the mini-series up with much in the way of looming Gothic threat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shots of crows flying, cuts away to spiders and roaches crawling across things, Iain Glen seen to be threateningly pawing at Naomi WattsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ top as she sleeps. There are some fine spooky scenes with the mad wife bursting through a wall to wildly attack Naomi Watts despite being blind. That said, rather than going for horror movie effect, the mini-series emphasizes period realism. The mini-series also boasts a beautiful score. On the minus side, the major problem that The Wyvern Mystery has rests with J. Sheridan Le Fanu. The book was written in the full Gothic cycle popularized by late 18th/early 19th Century authors like Anne Radcliffe and Wilkie Collins and is reliant on the heavy-handed brooding mood, improbable twists and revelations. The mini-series certainly feels dense and heavy going in terms of watching, even if the mood works.\n\nThe Wyvern Mystery boasts an interesting cast, including in the lead Naomi Watts some time before Mulholland Dr. (2001), The Ring (2002), King Kong (2005) et al. She receives support from the underrated Iain Glen and the great British acting legend Derek Jacobi who makes a surprise turnaround in a thuggish role as the Squire. \n\nAlso known as: El misterio Wyvern, Tajemnica Wyvern, O MistÃƒÂ©rio Wyvern, Kalla kÃƒÂ¥rar, ÃÂ¢ÃÂ°ÃÂ¹ÃÂ½ÃÂ° ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¼ÃÂµÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃ‘Å’Ã‘ï¿½ ÃÂ£ÃÂ¸ÃÂ²ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬ÃÂ½ / ÃÂ¢ÃÂ°ÃÂ¹ÃÂ½ÃÂ° Ã‘Æ’Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ°ÃÂ´Ã‘Å’ÃÂ±Ã‘â€¹ ÃÂ£ÃÂ¸ÃÂ²ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬ÃÂ½ / Ãï¿½ÃÂµÃÂ²Ã‘â€¹Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ°ÃÂ·ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¼Ã‘â€¹ÃÂ¹ Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ¶ÃÂ°Ã‘ï¿½.\nCountry: UK\nStudio: BBC Films, The Television Production Company\nDuration: 01:58:38\nInfo:\n\n[mediainfo]\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 58mn\nBit rate : 2 629 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 464 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:10\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.263\nStream size : 2.18 GiB (93%)\nWriting library : XviD 73\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 58mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 163 MiB (7%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 33 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duratio : 500 ms\n\n[/mediainfo]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c46cf08ee4d461102f880de3d19d17b6fcddc86","amp;dn":"The+Wyvern+Mystery+2000+DVDRip+XviD+Naomi+Watts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c46cf08ee4d461102f880de3d19d17b6fcddc86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,70,207,8,238,77,70,17,2,248,128,222,61,25,209,123,111,205,220,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
