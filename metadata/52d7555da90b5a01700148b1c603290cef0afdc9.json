And when a journalist researching the case is murdered twenty years later, the horror is reawakened. Sixteenth century Potwoolstan Hall, now a New Age healing centre, is reputed to be cursed because of the crimes of its builder, and it seems that this inheritance of evil lives on as DI Wesley Peterson is faced with his most disturbing case yet.\n\nAs more people die violently, Wesley needs to discover why a young woman has transformed a dolls house into a miniature reconstruction of the massacre scene. And could the solution to his case lie across the Atlantic Ocean, in the ruined remains of an early English settlement in Virginia USA?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52d7555da90b5a01700148b1c603290cef0afdc9","amp;dn":"Kate+Ellis-A+Cursed+Inheritance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52d7555da90b5a01700148b1c603290cef0afdc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,215,85,93,169,11,90,1,112,1,72,177,198,3,41,12,239,10,253,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
