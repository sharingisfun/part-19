It supports all CD and DVD formats and all common CD and DVD file-systems... Rescue lost files from a bad or trashed CD or DVD disc, save important documents, precious pictures, video from the family, your only system backup.\n\nStart up IsoBuster, Insert a CD or DVD, select the drive (if not selected already) and let IsoBuster mount the media. IsoBuster immediately shows you all the tracks and sessions located on the media, combined with all file-systems that are present. This way you get easy access, just like explorer, to all the files and folders per file-system. Instead of being limited to one file-system that the OS picks for you, you have access to &quot;the complete picture&quot;. Access data from older sessions, access data that your OS (e.g. Windows) does not see or hides from you etc.\n\nIsobuster interprets CD image files, such as:\n\n*.DAO (Duplicator), *.TAO (Duplicator), *.ISO (Nero, BlindRead, Creator), *.BIN (CDRWin), *.IMG (CloneCD), *.CCD (CloneCD) , *.CIF (Creator), *.FCD (Uncompressed), *.NRG (Nero), *.GCD (Prassi), *.P01 (Toast), *.C2D (WinOnCD), *.CUE (CDRWin), *.CDI (DiscJuggler), *.CD (CD-i OptImage), *.GI (Prassi PrimoDVD), *.PXI (PlexTools), *.MDS (Alcohol), *.MDF (Alcohol), *.VC4 (Virtual CD), *.000 (Virtual CD), *.B5T (BlindWrite), *.B5I (BlindWrite), *.DMG (Apple Macintosh), *.IBP (IsoBuster), *.IBQ (IsoBuster), *.NCD (NTI).\n\nChanges:\n* On Windows VISTA and higher, if you do not run in admin mode by default (UAC not disabled) you get the UAC (User * ** Account Control) popup each time when you start IsoBuster. This is because admin rights are required to talk to * * * Hard Drives and USB/Flash drives etc. However, in this version, if you disable listing Hard Drives and Flash drives * * in Options or during install, then you don't get the UAC anymore. The same is true when you run the shell command &quot;extract&quot; or when you start IsoBuster with command line parameters /nodrives or /nohd.\n* Support for GPT (GUID) Partition formatting\n* Also list empty card readers etc. when detected. Insert a card, hit refresh, and IsoBuster will show the content, like it does on optical media\n* Windows 7 (and higher) progress indication via the taskbar\n* Added the ability to choose how the VIDEO_TSVTS_0x_0x.VOB file size is determined in the VIDEO file-system (Via Options)\n* Implemented extra columns in Listview (Blocks, Offset, Last LBA, Attributes)\n* List unallocated space as a hidden partition, provided it has a reasonable size\n* File signature recognition for *.cr2 (Canon photo format)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd4ad04fd34e3ae295eac8aed4ed182462bf4b33","amp;dn":"IsoBuster+Pro+3.2.0.0+ML+With+Key+-+KurdTM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd4ad04fd34e3ae295eac8aed4ed182462bf4b33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,74,208,79,211,78,58,226,149,234,200,174,212,237,24,36,98,191,75,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
