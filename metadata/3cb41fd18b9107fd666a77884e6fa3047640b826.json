The way some others play chess or climb mountains, we Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º reverse. To us this is a sport/competition, nothing more. And s- Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º ince time is money, we are actually losing money doing this - have Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º no illusions. Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º This software is intended solely for (extended) evaluation purpos- Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º es and made available exclusively for a closed circle of mutual Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º contributors, also known as the scene. If the people inside this Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º closed group really like this software we strongly encourage them Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º to buy it. Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º We cannot be held responsible for any possible leak, only the per- Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º son leaking can. We absolutely do not condone the spreading of Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º this release outside this small group of mutual contributors. Any Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º such act should be considered a breach of our intentions, and in Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º any case piracy the way it looks nowadays has to be hunted down Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º case by case, copy by copy. If you want to try to sue the whole Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º world - be our guest! Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Should this not be enough, we do not reside in countries that im- Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º pose the USA-way of interpreting things. Your (often) fucked up Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º laws do not apply here, believe it or not. You are the ones under Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º investigation, and not for trifle schoolboy pranks but for really Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º serious infringements! Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º The USA-way of doing things has lately proven to be what it always Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º has been: a hemorrhoid in the arse for the rest of the globe. You Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º are the ones who should be under arrest - if any. But your exper- Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º tise in shifting attention to what is really not the deal is im- Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º pressive, as usual. Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â° You might be watching us, but we are also watching you...

Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º We aren't, unlike many other groups mechanical in nature - a 're- Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º lease machine', and we never intend to be; rather, we value the Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º friendship and learning experience that being part of a 0DAY group Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º offers much more than striving to pre the most releases each Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º month. Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º If ErES is a family you think you'd like to be a part of, you may Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º contact us using TORChat, our ID is: eresgrpmg2qjznqw, a response Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º isn't guaranteed to be immediate, or given at all. Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º We are currently looking for: Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º - Experienced crackers/keygenners for all Operating Systems; Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º - Skilled coders; Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º - Quality suppliers; Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º - Good 100Mbit+ EU &amp; Asia sites to affil with; Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º - Anything else you think we might like! Ãƒâ€º\n Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º\n Ã‚Â² We are NOT (and never will be) looking for: Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â² - Money/suppliers that think they can buy access to the scene; Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â² - Rented sites to affil with.
