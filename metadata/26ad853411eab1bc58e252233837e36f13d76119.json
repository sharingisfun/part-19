You said no. You shut down CongressÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s switchboards. You melted their servers. \nYour voice was loud and strong. Millions of people have spoken in defense of a free and open \nInternet.\n\nFor us, this is not about money. Its about knowledge. As a community of authors, editors, \nphotographers, and programmers, we invite everyone to share and build upon our work.\n\nOur mission is to empower and engage people to document the sum of all human knowledge, and \nto make it available to all humanity, in perpetuity. We care passionately about the rights \nof authors, because we are authors.\n\nSOPA and PIPA are not dead: they are waiting in the shadows. Whats happened in the last 24 \nhours, though, is extraordinary. The internet has enabled creativity, knowledge, and innovation \nto shine, and as Wikipedia went dark, youve directed your energy to protecting it.\n\nWere turning the lights back on. Help us keep them shining brightly.\n\n\n[Your chance to get involved and save your Internet]\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/SOPA/Blackoutpage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/SOPA/Blackoutpage&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://americancensorship.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://americancensorship.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nRipper.......: EAC V1.0 beta 3, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC - 8 - oan\n\nCodec........: Free Lossless Audio Codec [FLAC]\n\nVersion......: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nQuality......: Lossless, [avg. compression: 69 %]\n\nChannels.....: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nTags.........: VorbisComment\n\nScand Artwork.........: @ 600dpi\n\nTraders Little Helper....: checksum Files .ffp &amp; .md5\n\nLyrics....: No .lol\n\nTorrent Pieces....: 11120 x 64 kb\n\n\nRipped by....: (oan) on 17/01/2012\n\n\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 20/01/2012\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/5223/8ceb5862.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/5223/8ceb5862.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ad853411eab1bc58e252233837e36f13d76119","amp;dn":"Rage+Against+the+Machine+1992+-+Evil+Empire+1996+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ad853411eab1bc58e252233837e36f13d76119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,173,133,52,17,234,177,188,88,226,82,35,56,55,227,111,19,215,97,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
