She cast a spell on millions more viewers as  Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. Now, in Melissa Explains It All, Melissa tells the frank and funny behind-the-scenes stories from her extraordinary past and her refreshingly normal present.\n\nMelissa has been entertaining audiences most of her life; when there were no girls named Melissa on her favorite show, the forceful four year old decided sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d get on TV her way. From that moment on, Melissa has shown a singular determination and focusÃ¢â‚¬â€whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for booking three national commercials so her dad would build her a tree house or for nailing the audition for Clarissa.\n\nFrom her first commercial to her current starring role in ABC FamilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hit Melissa and Joey, Hart never let fame go to her head. She always had one foot in Hollywood and one foot in realityÃ¢â‚¬â€and still does. Melissa makes us laugh along with her as she talks about:\n\n--guest appearances in shows like Saturday Night Live and The Equalizer\n--auditioning for Punky Brewster and Clarissa\n--her early Broadway days\n--wacky parties sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thrown and attended\n-- the actors who influenced her and whom she befriended, worked with and competed against\n--her experiences both on and off-setÃ¢â‚¬â€with SabrinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Salem the Cat and Elvis the Alligator on Clarissa\n--how she met the love of her life at the Kentucky Derby\n\nMelissa Joan Hart explains all that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learned along the wayÃ¢â‚¬â€whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kept her grounded, normal and working when others have not been so fortunateÃ¢â‚¬â€and that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the approachable, hilarious girl-next-door her fans have always thought sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a65181934e99512451f95051f34bd14780db9c9a","amp;dn":"Melissa+Explains+It+All+-+Mellisa+Joan+Hart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a65181934e99512451f95051f34bd14780db9c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,81,129,147,78,153,81,36,81,249,80,81,243,75,209,71,128,219,156,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
