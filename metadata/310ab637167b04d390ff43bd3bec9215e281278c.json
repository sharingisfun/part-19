The sky is afire, the oceans are risingÃ¢â‚¬â€and mankind is to blame. While the spoils of the 20th Century dwindle, Jack Finnegan lives on the fringes in his decaying mansion, struggling to keep his life afloat and his loved ones safe while battling that most modern of diseasesÃ¢â‚¬â€AIDS.\n\nAs the New Millennium approaches, JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former lover, a famous photographer reveling in the world's decay, gifts him with a mysterious elixir called Fusax, a medicine rumored to cure the incurable AIDS. But soon, the &quot;side effects&quot; of Fusax become more apparent, and Jack gets mixed up with a bizarre entourage of rock stars, Japanese scientists, corporate executives, AIDS victims, and religious terrorists. While these larger players compete to control mankind's fate in the 21st Century, Jack is forced to choose his own role in the World's End, and how to live with it.\n\nOriginally published in 1997, Glimmering is a visionary mix of fantasy and science fiction about a world in which humanity struggles to cope with the ever-approaching End of the End.\n\n&quot;[Hand's] bleak ecological disaster novel, which straddles sf and fantasy, belongs in most collections.&quot; --Library Journal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:310ab637167b04d390ff43bd3bec9215e281278c","amp;dn":"Glimmering+by+Elizabeth+Hand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"310ab637167b04d390ff43bd3bec9215e281278c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,10,182,55,22,123,4,211,144,255,67,189,59,236,146,21,226,129,39,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
