All fixed now.\n\nI'm sorry for the mistake, I hope you realize it's very hard for me to find the time for all this lately.\n\n\n \n\nThis DLCs pack AUTOMATICALLY installs patch and crack 1.02\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nCrack has been modified to provide access to bonus items.\n\n\nNew installer is built on a much more complicated script to provide a proper automatic installation. I've tested it many times, but just in case - report any problems if you'll encounter any.\n\n\n\n\n\nReadme copied from previous torrent:\n\n------------------------------------\n\n\nOk, this is a repack of all existing Dragon Age 2 DLCs. It contains:\n\n\n- Black Emporium\n- Pre-Order Bonus Items\n- Signature Edition Items\n- The Exiled Prince\n\n(Isaac's armor from Dead Space 2 is obviously included too).\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES (yes, important, so read):\n\n\n* Everything is cracked for you, you only need to press &quot;Install&quot;;\n\n* Depending which Act you are playing, you may need to access &quot;Special Deliveries&quot; chest once or twice to get all the bonus items. Which means you may need to exit the house, and return again.\n\n* In order to have the Mabari war hound in your party, you need to open the character's ability tree, and drag the Summon Mabari icon to your on-screen ability quick-access list;\n\n* Installing a new patch or a different crack WILL disable DLC bonus items, because accessing them requires hacking &quot;DragonAge2.exe&quot; file, and as you know, patches and cracks replace this file.\n\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nFeel free to share this everywhere you can and want.\n\n*******\n\nThe usual warning: Comodo, ClamAV, and probably Avira may detect any and all my installers as viruses. I don't know why, and I don't care. There are no \nviruses, and have never been any.\n\n\n***\n\nI do not include Patch 1.02 changelog - it is a long list. Google it.\n\nRing of Whispers is still not included - there is no reliable crack for it yet. You'll have to do without.\n\n\n\n-illiria","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc5d6a11f7a60bfd363048f6d285477385a9583c","amp;dn":"Dragon+Age+2+DLC+Pack+%28with+Patch+1.02%29+-illiria+%2AFIXED%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc5d6a11f7a60bfd363048f6d285477385a9583c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,93,106,17,247,166,11,253,54,48,72,246,210,133,71,115,133,169,88,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
