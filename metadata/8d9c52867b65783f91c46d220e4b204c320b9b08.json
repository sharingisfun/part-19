As Prof X gathers himself to attack the threat \nDr Sasaki tells him the boy is his own son who she had told him had died. As the X-Men attack Takeo's incredible \nreality warping ability turns  lightning to ice and reflects attacks back upon the attacker. \nThe Professor tries to enter Takeo's mind to gain control of his runaway power but cyclops wants to attack the the boy \nwhile he is mindlocked with the professor, even at the risk of Xaviers life. Charles tries to calm Takeo's mind while \nHisako recalls their childhood friendship and tries to remind him of it as well, will they succeed in breaking through \nto him and save the world?...\n\n[B]Spoken Language:- Japanese\n\nSubtitled Language:- English\n\nSubtitles by [commie] [/B]\n=============================\n\nScreenshots\n-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n\n[URL=http://img89.imageshack.us/i/xmenanime112destinybond.jpg/][IMG]http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/2225/xmenanime112destinybond.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n================================\n\nFile Info\n-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 175M\nPlayTime           : 00:23:29.876\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 42254\nVideoBitRate       : 904154\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat:- Xvid AVI\n\n=============================\n\nHash\n-=-=-=-\n\n8D9C52867B65783F91C46D220E4B204C320B9B08\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d9c52867b65783f91c46d220e4b204c320b9b08","amp;dn":"X-Men%5Banime%5D-112-Destiny%7EBond-Eng-Subs-Xvid-%5BBy-Oj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d9c52867b65783f91c46d220e4b204c320b9b08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,156,82,134,123,101,120,63,145,196,109,34,14,75,32,76,50,11,155,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
