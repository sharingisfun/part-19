The group was formed by Timmons in Los Angeles, California.\n\nUnlike most boy bands, they formed independently and were later picked up by a record label, as opposed to being assembled by a label or a producer. They have sold over 10 million records worldwide and achieved eight Top 40 singles in the US.\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n   1. &quot;Intro&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:38 (98Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° and Bernard Grubman)\n   2. &quot;Come And Get It&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 (Montell Jordan)\n   3. &quot;Invisible Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41 (Dane DeViller, Sean Hosein, and Steve Kipner)\n   4. &quot;Was It Something I Didn't Say&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02 (Diane Warren)\n   5. &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31 (Steve Grissette and Maxx Frank)\n   6. &quot;Hand In Hand&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18 (Mario Winans and Kenneth Hickson)\n   7. &quot;Intermood&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:31 (98Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° and Bernard Grubman)\n   8. &quot;Dreaming&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00 (Montell Jordan, Shep Crawford, and Professor Funk)\n   9. &quot;Heaven's Missing An Angel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42 (Christopher A.
