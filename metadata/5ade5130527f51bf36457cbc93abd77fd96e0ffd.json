Who is behind it, what is being planned, and why Jerry and Rachel?\n\nSource...: Bluray\nContainer: Mp4\nVideo....: H264 1280x528 1800kbps 23.976fs\nAudio....: English AAC 48000Hz 6ch 255Kbps\nRuntime..: 01:57:35\nFilesize.: 1.69GB\nSubtitle.: English,Svenska (separate)\n\nMovie snapshots included in torrent.\n\n\nMore Movie info:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059786/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059786/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMore Subtitles: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sub-titles.net/en/ppodnapisi/search?tbsl=1&amp;asdp=0&amp;sK=eagle+eye&amp;sM=&amp;sJ=0&amp;submit=Search&amp;sAKA=1&amp;sY=&amp;sR=&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sub-titles.net/en/ppodnapisi/search?tbsl=1&amp;asdp=0&amp;sK=eagle+eye&amp;sM=&amp;sJ=0&amp;submit=Search&amp;sAKA=1&amp;sY=&amp;sR=&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/PetaFOX&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/PetaFOX&lt;/a&gt;\n\nConverted with Handbrake v0.9.4\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ade5130527f51bf36457cbc93abd77fd96e0ffd","amp;dn":"Eagle+Eye+2008+Bluray+720p+H264+AAC+6ch+JBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ade5130527f51bf36457cbc93abd77fd96e0ffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,222,81,48,82,127,81,191,54,69,124,188,147,171,215,127,217,110,15,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
