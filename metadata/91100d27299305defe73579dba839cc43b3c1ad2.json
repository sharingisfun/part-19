If you are using Vista or Windows XP, there are two ways for you to protect against accidents: system restore points and backup files. Meanwhile, if you are using Windows 2000 (SP4), Windows 98 (SE) or Windows ME, every time you remove a registry item a backup file is created.\n\nProgram Shortcuts\nIncorrect program shortcuts can cause headaches! They could cause applications to take longer to launch or even stop them from working at all. RegCure finds and removes these incorrect shortcuts and improves your PCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance.\n\nBuilt-In Scheduler\nWith RegCureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scheduling feature, you can just tell it when you want it to do its job, sit back and relax.

You can even set up more than one schedule.\n\nInvalid Class Keys and Shell Extensions\nNon-working class keys and shell extensions can seriously slow down your PC and cause frustrations.
