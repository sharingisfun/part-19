Stars Die: The Delerium Years '91-97, narrows its focus to the group's psychedelic, pre-ambient Pink Floyd era that relied heavily on guitarist/founder Steve Wilson's more pop-oriented -- but still epic -- compositions. The two discs pack 21 assorted rarities, previously unreleased tracks, and new mixes into an elegant box featuring a deluxe 40-page booklet that's worth the price of the collection itself. Listeners looking for an entry point into this Porcupine Tree period would do well giving this anthology a shot, while fans of acts like Ozric Tentacles, Tangerine Dream, and Flying Saucer Attack, who have remained in the dark about the group, will likely find them to be a new and wonderful addiction..\n-= Review by James Christopher Monger =-\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Radioactive Toy\n[02] Nine Cats\n[03] And The Swallows Dance Above The Sun\n[04] The Nostalgia Factory\n[05] Voyage 34 (Phase One)\n[06] Synesthesia (Extended Version)\n[07] Phantoms\n[08] Up The Downstair\n[09] Fadeaway\n[10] Rainy Taxi\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:12m:55s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Stars Die\n[02] The Sky Moves Sideways (Phase One)\n[03] Men Of Wood\n[04] Waiting\n[05] The Sound Of No-One Listening\n[06] Colourflow In Mind\n[07] Fuse The Sky\n[08] Signify II\n[09] Every Home Is Wired\n[10] Sever\n[11] Dark Matter\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:13m:24s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 02h:26m:19s\nTotal File Size....................... 918mb (Including FLACs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
