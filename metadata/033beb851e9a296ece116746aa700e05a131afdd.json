Directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the film was released by Sony Pictures Entertainment on November 9, 2007 and has thus become the first Indian movie to be co-produced and distributed by a Hollywood production house. It is the second Bollywood movie to be released on Blu Ray(first being Heyy babyy). The stars are Ranbir Kapoor (Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh&amp;#039;s son), Sonam Kapoor (Anil Kapoor&amp;#039;s daughter), Salman Khan, and Rani Mukerji, with veteran actresses Zohra Sehgal and Begum Para in supporting roles.\n\nPlot\n\nRaj was loved by one and all, for he always brought happiness to the people around him. Destiny plans a magical tale for Raj over the next four nights of his life that shall change his entire being &quot;Saawariya&quot; is the story of a couple&amp;#039;s chance encounter and the advance of their parallel obsessions over four successive nights. An impromptu romance is initiated in a remote town in the serene beauty of picturesque Simla, a quaint hill station in Northern India that was once the summer capital of India under the British Raj, known for its lakes, mist, heavenly snowfall, rains and the tall swaying pine trees. The bright, fun-filled winding streets of the mall come alive with singing clubs, rustic folklore, dancing, love ballads, flourishing colonies of artists and weavers, and chants from the monastery- all woven in perfect harmony into a magical dream. It is here that the dreamer finds the &amp;#039;lost&amp;#039; self in himself. \n\n\nDirected by Sanjay Leela Bhansali \nProduced by Columbia Tristar &amp; SLB Films \nWritten by Prakash Kapadia, based on the short story White Nights by Fyodor Dostoevsky \nStarring Ranbir Kapoor Sonam Kapoor Salman Khan Rani Mukerji Zohra Sehgal Begum Para \n\nRelease date(s) November 9, 2007 \nRunning time 128 Minutes\n\nSource.......................: Original DVD5\nDisc 1.......................: 699 MB\nDisc 2.......................: 700 MB\nResolution...................: 640 x 272\nCodec........................: XviD, 2 Pass mode\nBitrate......................: Avg. 950 kBit/s\nFormat.......................: MP3\nSampleRate...................: 48000 Hz\nBitrate......................: 320 kBit/s\nSubtittles...................: English hard coded\nScreenshots..................:\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033beb851e9a296ece116746aa700e05a131afdd","amp;dn":"Saawariya+%282007%29+%5B%28Hindi%29+ENGSub+DVDrip+%28XviD%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033beb851e9a296ece116746aa700e05a131afdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,59,235,133,30,154,41,110,206,17,103,70,170,112,14,5,161,49,175,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
