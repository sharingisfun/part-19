Suddenly he is on the front page of every New York newspaper, and his life is hopelessly entwined in the increasingly shocking life (and perhaps death) of Sasha Nijinsky, the country's hottest and most beautiful television anchorwoman. Stone finds himself caught in a perilous web of unspeakable crimes, dangerous friends, and sexual depravity.
