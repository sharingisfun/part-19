Now Goodkind returns with a broad-canvas adventure of epic intrigue, violent conflict, and terrifying peril for the beautiful Kahlan Amnell and her husband, the heroic Richard Rahl, the Sword of Truth.\n\nRichard Rahl has been poisoned. Saving an empire from annihilation is the price of the antidote. With the shadow of death looming near, the empire crumbling before the invading hordes, and time running out, Richard is offered not only his own life but the salvation of a people, in exchange for delivering his wife, Kahlan, into bondage to the enemy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb9f317390fbef6fb01d3be50b6619f57cf914f9","amp;dn":"Naked+Empire+%28Sword+of+Truth%2C+%238%29+-+Terry+Goodkind.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb9f317390fbef6fb01d3be50b6619f57cf914f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,159,49,115,144,251,239,111,176,29,59,229,11,102,25,245,124,249,20,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
