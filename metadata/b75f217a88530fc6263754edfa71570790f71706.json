At the moment, there is no known method to extract the password from the compressed\nfile; so the only available methods are &quot;brute force&quot; and dictionary-based attacks. Here is a brief\nlist of ARPR's advantages:\n\n* ARPR has a convenient and easy to use user interface;\n* ARPR works with one protected file at a time (multiple uses of ARPR is possible);\n* all compression methods are supported;\n* self-extracting archives are supported;\n* you can select the custom character set for &quot;brute-force&quot; attack\n* you can interrupt the program at any time. Resuming is supported;\n* ARPR can work in the background, using the CPU only when it is in an idle state;\n* ARPR can utilise either a customizable &quot;brute-force&quot; approach, or an effective dictionary-based\n  approach. The different approaches can be used for all RAR types and compression methods\n  using AES (Rijndael) 128-bit encryption, e.g., set the password length (range) of the character set\n  used to generate the passwords, and many other options;\n* A multilingual interface is provided.\n\n\nInstall-Notes:\n==============\n\ninstall &amp; check crack dir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b75f217a88530fc6263754edfa71570790f71706","amp;dn":"Advanced.RAR.Password.Recovery.v1.53-YAG.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b75f217a88530fc6263754edfa71570790f71706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,95,33,122,136,83,15,198,38,55,84,237,250,113,87,7,144,247,23,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
