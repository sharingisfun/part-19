English sailors arrive on the shores of the Polynesian paradiseÃ¢â‚¬â€ a place of staggering beauty where magic and ancient myths still hold sway. But they soon devastate the island with disease, war, and death, planting deadly seeds that will be carried back to England forty years later.\n\nLondon 1812. On a gray June morning, the Solander docks, her hold containing hundreds of exotic plants from Tahiti for the KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gardens at Kew. The apparently successful expedition soon takes a horrifyingÃ¢â‚¬â€ and inexplicableÃ¢â‚¬â€turn: The crew of the Solander starts dying one by one. \n\nThames River Police Chief Charles Horton can find no signs of murder or suicide to explain the deaths, and the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surviving crew seems intent on hampering his investigation. When one of the plants begins to show frightening changes, it is up to Charles Horton to determine how it might be stopped.\n\nGenre: Fiction, Mystery/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f6373fd4c4e2ff751d28f67808041d59ef9d4a","amp;dn":"The+Poisoned+Island+by+Lloyd+Shepherd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f6373fd4c4e2ff751d28f67808041d59ef9d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,246,55,63,212,196,226,255,117,29,40,246,120,8,4,29,89,239,157,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
