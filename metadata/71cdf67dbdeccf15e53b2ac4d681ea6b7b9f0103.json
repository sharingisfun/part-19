(period) for an object \n        instance : VbsEdit displays a list of valid member variables or functions \n        for the appropriate object or class. \n\n\tAfter the name of a function, type an open parenthesis : Vbsedit displays \n        the complete declaration for the function in a pop-up window just under \n        the insertion point. \n\n\tThe Object Browser allows you to examine and discover WMI classes and \n        objects used in the current script and their members. Vbsedit generates \n        WMI scripts for you (like Scriptomatic). \n\n\tVbsedit support syntax coloring and can display line numbers. \n\n\tCode snippets are one of the coolest new features in VbsEdit. Code \n        snippets are customizable code fragments intended to accomplish simple to \n        intermediate tasks quickly; they can be inserted into your code with just \n        a few keystrokes. \n\n\tWhat really makes code snippets so convenient to use is the replacement \n        fields, highlighted areas that identify the values you may commonly want \n        to replace to fit the snippet to your specific task. You can use F4 to \n        move through replacement fields (ex: Type &quot;select&quot; and press F4)\n\t\n\nFEATURES\n\n\t- NEW!!!\n\n\t\t# Convert your scripts into executables\n\t\t# Resolves an issue with samples\n\t\t# Resolves an issue with tooltips\n\t\t# Resolves an issue with Windows Vista SP1\n\t\t# Resolves a minor issue with Microsoft Visual Studio\n\t\t# Enhanced Object Browser\n\t\t# Better ClearType support  \n\t\n\t\n\nFor More Info on VBSedit 3.6.12 Visit:\n        hhttp://www.vbsedit.com\n\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\n\n\t- Install it\n\t- Copy the content of .Crack into the main app folder\n\t- Enjoy\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71cdf67dbdeccf15e53b2ac4d681ea6b7b9f0103","amp;dn":"VBSedit+3.6.12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71cdf67dbdeccf15e53b2ac4d681ea6b7b9f0103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,205,246,125,189,236,207,21,229,59,42,196,214,129,234,107,123,159,1,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
