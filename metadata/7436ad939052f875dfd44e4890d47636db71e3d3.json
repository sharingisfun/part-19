Then, the soundboard tape came out, showing full potnential of the first night of Maryland run. The performance itself is amazing, one of the strongest and best of the 1977 tour. These four nights in Landover were a very strong segment of the tour. Jimmy is on for the whole show and the entire band is playing great and inspired music. Even Robert is in very strong voice and high spirits. No Quarter is excellent and Achilles Last Stand is blistering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7436ad939052f875dfd44e4890d47636db71e3d3","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1977.05.25+Landover%2C+Maryland+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7436ad939052f875dfd44e4890d47636db71e3d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,54,173,147,144,82,248,117,223,212,78,72,144,212,118,54,219,113,227,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
