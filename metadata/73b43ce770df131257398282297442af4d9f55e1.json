The performance of the Seventh symphony is phenomenal. Play it loud! This is not background music for your doctor's office!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73b43ce770df131257398282297442af4d9f55e1","amp;dn":"Beethoven+Symphonies+%28J.E.+Gardiner%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73b43ce770df131257398282297442af4d9f55e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,180,60,231,112,223,19,18,87,57,130,130,41,116,66,175,77,159,85,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
