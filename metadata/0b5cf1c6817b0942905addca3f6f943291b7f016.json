But it is neither deft nor private and in fact is witnessed by Mark Sway, a bright ll-year-old, who hears from the dying man a deadly secret \nabout a Louisiana Senator's murder. The accused killer, Mafia thug Barry Muldanno, is about to go on trial.\n\nEveryone wants to know the attorney's last words. But Mark dissembles. He knows that he knows too much, maybe too much to live. Streetsmart and wise beyond his years, he hires a lawyer: Reggie Love, a feisty 52-year-old divorcee who realizes she's in over her head. Then Mark comes up with a plan -- a crazy plan in Reggie's opinion -- but it's their only hope. And it just might work! \n\nUnabridged, approximately 14.3 hours, from 12 CDs at 128 kbps in MP3 format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b5cf1c6817b0942905addca3f6f943291b7f016","amp;dn":"John+Grisham+-+The+Client","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b5cf1c6817b0942905addca3f6f943291b7f016","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,92,241,198,129,123,9,66,144,90,221,202,63,111,148,50,145,183,240,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
