He looks back on the last five years and remembers what went so wrong. Five years earlier, Superman realises that Lois Lane is pregnant. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ecstatic and wants to protect her in every way possible. Problem is she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want things to change and heads out on a mission with her trusty photographer. But things quickly go wrong and, when Lois goes missing, Superman calls in as many Justice League members as he can. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the rest of the team to save Lois from the JokerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clutches.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81515b3553d15b676b1fe21d31d2400144f63635","amp;dn":"Injustice+Gods+Among+Us+Issue+1+-+March+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81515b3553d15b676b1fe21d31d2400144f63635","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,81,91,53,83,209,91,103,107,31,226,29,49,210,64,1,68,246,54,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
