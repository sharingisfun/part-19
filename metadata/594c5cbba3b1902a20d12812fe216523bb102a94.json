Born the son of a candy store owner, at age thirteen Horowitz began playing drums; shortly thereafter, he began listening to the music of the Rolling Stones and started playing guitar. Although he grew up in the 1970s, Horowitz was influenced by artists of the 1960s, including Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and among others Stevie Ray Vaughn.\n \nPopa Chubby - Universal Breakdown Blues (flac) [MentalZero][Eccles] (Size: 404.32 MB)\n \t\t00 Popa Chubby album art 01.JPG\t58.48 KB\n \t\t00 Popa Chubby album art 02.JPG\t70.33 KB\n \t\t01 I Don't Want Nobody.flac\t29.72 MB\n \t\t02 I Ain't Giving Up.flac\t32.31 MB\n \t\t03 Universal Breakdown Blues.flac\t33.66 MB\n \t\t04 The Peoples Blues.flac\t56.64 MB\n \t\t05 Rock Me Baby.flac\t36.22 MB\n \t\t06 69 Dollars.flac\t28.88 MB\n \t\t07 Over The Rainbow.flac\t56.05 MB\n \t\t08 I Need A Lil' Mojo.flac\t29.59 MB\n \t\t09 Danger Man.flac\t21.61 MB\n \t\t10 Goin' Back To Amsterdam (Reefer Smokin' Man).flac\t31.24 MB\n \t\t11 The Finger Bangin' Boogie.flac\t17.06 MB\n \t\t12 Mind Bender.flac\t31.21 MB\n \t\tPopa Chubby - Universal Breakdown Blues.m3u\t1.85 KB\n \t\tUniversal Breakdown Blues.cue\t2.3 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t2.92 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker.log\t869 bytes\n \nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 404 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Universal Breakdown Blues \t\t\t\nTrack name/Total                         : 12\nComposer                                 : Popa Chubby\nGenre                                    : Blues Rock\nRecorded date                            : May 28, 2013\n\n\n\n===========================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 957 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594c5cbba3b1902a20d12812fe216523bb102a94","amp;dn":"Popa+Chubby+-+Universal+Breakdown+Blues+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D%5BEccl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594c5cbba3b1902a20d12812fe216523bb102a94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,76,92,187,163,177,144,42,32,209,40,18,254,33,101,35,187,16,42,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
