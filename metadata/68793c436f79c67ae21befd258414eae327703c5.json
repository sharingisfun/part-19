They were originally established with American rock band Elf's members, but Blackmore fired all the members except Ronnie James Dio who would leave in 1979. Three British musicians joined in 1979, singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey, former Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;. Over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. Other lead singers Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White would follow, and the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neoclassical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group.\n\nRainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band has sold over 28 million albums worldwide and 4 million albums in the United States.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinyl Vinyl is a collection of live recordings and B-sides by the British hard rock band Rainbow and was released in 1986, after the band had already disbanded in 1984. All the studio tracks had previously been released.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes:\n------\n\nThe cover photograph of Ritchie Blackmore was taken by Ross Halfin after a concert at the Deutschlandhalle in Berlin in November 1982.\n\nThe LP notes mistakenly credit drums on &quot;Weiss Heim&quot; to Bobby Rondinelli, when in fact they were performed by Cozy Powell.\n\nThe instrumental &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; is taken from the final Japanese Rainbow date in 1984 and features a full orchestral accompaniment. The guitar solo was re-recorded and differs from the video release.\n\nThe song &quot;Man on the Silver Mountain&quot; features guitar overdubs.\n\nThe original double vinyl release omitted &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, although it was included on the cassette version before &quot;Jealous Lover&quot;. The first CD issue, a single disc, omitted both &quot;Street of Dreams&quot; and &quot;Tearin' Out My Heart&quot;. These were restored on the 2CD remastered edition of 1999, which features different lengths for several tracks along with the original artwork.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n----------\n\nGuitar: Ritchie Blackmore\n\nVocals: Joe Lynn Turner (tracks 1-6, 10-11, 15), Graham Bonnet (tracks 7-8), Ronnie James Dio (tracks 12-13)\n\nBass: Roger Glover (all except tracks 12-13), Bob Daisley (tracks 12-13)\n\nDrums: Chuck Burgi (tracks 1-3, 9, 15), Bobby Rondinelli (tracks 4-6, 10-11), Cozy Powell (tracks 7-8, 12-14)\n\nKeyboards: David Rosenthal (tracks 1-3, 6, 9-11, 15), Don Airey (tracks 4-5, 7-8, 14), David Stone (tracks 12-13)\n\nBacking Vocals: Lin Robinson (tracks 1-5, 8-9, 15) and Dee Beale (tracks 4-5, 10-11)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68793c436f79c67ae21befd258414eae327703c5","amp;dn":"Rainbow+-+Finyl+Vinyl+%5B2+CD%27s%5D%5B1986%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BJAPAN+SHM-CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68793c436f79c67ae21befd258414eae327703c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,121,60,67,111,121,198,122,226,27,239,210,88,65,78,174,50,119,3,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
