There had never been a day when he had not shown her some small kindness.\nThe birth of a daughter, Jeannie Eliza, crowns the young couple's happiness -- just as her shockingly early death casts them low. But they do not need to talk about Jeannie because she remains with them, and their love does not change.\nIn some ways it is no wonder that one of them falls ill, for grief takes its toll, and one Christmas even Eve's sister Miriam is remarking that Tommy looks unwell. But what happens next is entirely unexpected, not least for the kind man.\n\n\nAbout Susan Hill\nSusan Hill has been a full-time writer since 1963 and has written over thirty titles. Since 1977 she has been a monthly columnist for the Daily Telegraph.\nShe has also written several non-fiction books and books for children (Can It Be True? won the Smarties Prize), as well as editing short story compilations.\nAs well as writing, she has set up a publishing company, Long Barn Books, inspired by her lifelong admiration for Virginia Woolf and the Hogarth Press. She also runs a literary magazine, Books and Company, and owns the lease on a gift shop in Chipping Campden.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1695e16aa5ca31c879d043597a578850532bd75","amp;dn":"A+Kind+Man+-+Susan+Hill+++%282011+-+Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1695e16aa5ca31c879d043597a578850532bd75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,105,94,22,170,92,163,28,135,157,4,53,151,165,120,133,5,50,189,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
