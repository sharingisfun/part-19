Technologies such as direct-to-consumer genetic testing, pharmacogenetically developed therapies in cancer care, private umbilical cord blood banking, and neurocognitive enhancement claim to cater to an individual's specific biological character, and, in some cases, these technologies have shown powerful potential. Yet in others they have produced negligible or even negative results. Whatever is behind the rise of Me Medicine, it isn't just science. So why is Me Medicine rapidly edging out We Medicine, and how has our commitment to our collective health suffered as a result?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e8b347bf443f4a069235aafa09fa8890c8b8899","amp;dn":"Me+Medicine+vs.+We+Medicine%3A+Reclaiming+Biotechnology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e8b347bf443f4a069235aafa09fa8890c8b8899","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,139,52,123,244,67,244,160,105,35,90,175,160,159,168,137,12,139,136,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
