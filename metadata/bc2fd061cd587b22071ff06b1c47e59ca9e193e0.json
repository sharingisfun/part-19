His songs have set a virtually unmatched standard in their seriousness and range. Sex, spirituality, religion, power ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he has relentlessly examined the largest issues in human lives, always with a full appreciation of how elusive answers can be to the vexing questions he raises. But those questions, and the journey he has traveled in seeking to address them, are the ever-shifting substance of his work, as well as the reasons why his songs never lose their overwhelming emotional force.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
