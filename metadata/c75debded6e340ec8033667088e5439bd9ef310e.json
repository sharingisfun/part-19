Spanning Amos' entire career (from 1992's Little Earthquakes through 2005's The Beekeeper) and compiled on a two-disc set, these 19 videos feature some very striking images: the decidedly weird special effects in &quot;A Sorta Fairytale,&quot; making Amos and actor Adrien Brody's heads appear where knees and hands ought to be; the bound and blindfolded Amos in the dark and disturbing &quot;Spark&quot;; Spanish women lying in the street as a handsome priest passes among them in &quot;Past the Mission&quot;; the slow-motion riot scenes in &quot;1000 Oceans,&quot; Amos' response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. But the singer-songwriter-pianist's breathy commentary track is as the dramatic as the videos themselves. Usually referring to herself in the third person, Amos admits to &quot;a fascination with the beheading of Anne BoleynÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ the illicit mistress of the Protestant reformation,&quot; identifies with &quot;the Black Madonna, the independent womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ who is being shamed for her sensuality,&quot; describes the &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; video as &quot;evil on a playgroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ sort of Mean Girls before there was Mean Girls,&quot; and regularly references mythology. What she doesn't explain is why the same bonus features (two extra tracks and a making-of featurette) appear on both discs, or why a couple of fan favorites (like &quot;Strange Little Girl&quot;) aren't included at all.\n\n\nVIDEO\nCodec: AVC (x264)\nBitrate: Varies between 400 and 750 Kbps\nResolution: 640x480 (4:3)\nFramerate: 29.97\n\nAUDIO\nCodec: AAC\nBitrate: ~165 Kbps\nChannels: 2 (Stereo)\n\n\nNOTE: There are 2 separate versions of each video included: one with Tori's commentary and one without.
