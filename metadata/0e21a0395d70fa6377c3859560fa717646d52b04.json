JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brother-like bond with his wealthy neighbor Freddy, and his secret love for Anne the neighborhood beauty, were all that made life tolerable. Now at college, Jack attacks life with a vengeance. Fuelled by narcotics, alcohol, and a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t lose philosophyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, he runs with the popular crowd, pledges the schoolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most exclusive fraternity, and continues to pine for Anne even though he knows Freddy loves her. The drugs, booze and death defying initiation process cannot stop Jack, but a series of devastating blackouts that force him to question reality stagger Jack like a backhand smack from his old man and threaten to end his perfect life.\n\nVideo Bitrate..: 842 kbps \nAudio Bitrate..: 135 kbps MP3 VBR Stereo\nAspect Ratio...: 1.81:1\nResolution.....: 640 x 352\nFrame Rate.....: 25.000 fps\nRuntime........: 99 mins\nAudio Language.: English\n\ncredit VoMiT &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e21a0395d70fa6377c3859560fa717646d52b04","amp;dn":"Perfect.Life.2008.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e21a0395d70fa6377c3859560fa717646d52b04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,33,160,57,93,112,250,99,119,195,133,149,96,250,113,118,70,213,43,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
