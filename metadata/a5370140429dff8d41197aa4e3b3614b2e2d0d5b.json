This time out, Allan has \ncreated seven new project-based tutorials that push the built-in Particle Flow particle system to the limit and \nbeyond. With a running length of over 6 hours, this training DVD is aimed at intermediate and advanced users. \nAllan starts off with easier effects like creating a DNA strand out of particles,then ramps up to more complex \nnatural effects including procedural lava and particle fire, as well as building a crumbling iceberg, splashing \nbarrels and exploding tanks. \n\nTo achieve several of these effects, Allan spends time showcasing two Autodesk Certified Animation Plug-ins: \nAfterBurn 3 and Particle Flow Tools: Box 1 and discusses how they can extend what the core PFlow particle system \ncan do.\n\nFinally, Allan illustrates how to set up your render passes and through the use of Eyeon's Digital Fusion \ncompositing application, blends the various layers together to achieve the final effects. \n\nJust look at this course outline:\n\nProject 1: DNA Strand\nProjectOverview\nParticle Flow Setup\nTotal Running Time: 19:03\n\nProject 2: Point Fire\nProject Overview\nParticle Flow Setup\nDigital Fusion Composite\nAlternate Point Fire: Fire On Ground\nTotal Running Time: 19:58\n\nProject 3: Oozing Lava\nProject Overview\nParticle Flow Setup Part 1\nParticle Flow Setup Part 2\nMaterials Part 1\nMaterials Part 2\nLava Lights\nRender Pass Setup\nDigital Fusion Composite\nTotal Running Time: 1:19:40\n\nProject 4: Barrel Splash\nProject Overview\nParticle Flow Setup\nUsing LockBond (PFlow Tools)\nSplash Setup\nSplash Material\nFoam Setup\nFoam Material\nAfterBurn Setup\nDigital Fusion Composite\nTotal Running Time: 1:57:53\n\nProject 5: Icebergs\nProject Overview\nParticle Flow Setup Part 1\nParticle Flow Setup Part 2\nTotal Running Time: 41:30\n\nProject 6: Tank Explosion\nProject Overview\nAfterBurn Explosion Setup\nParticle Flow Setup\nRe-purpose of Preset (PFlow Tools)\nTotal Running Time: 1:08:30\n\nProject 7: Particle Tanks\nProject Overview\nParticle Flow Setup\nUsing MAXScript to control the Tanks\nTotal Running Time: 26:05\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5370140429dff8d41197aa4e3b3614b2e2d0d5b","amp;dn":"3DMax+Turbo+Training++Advanced+Visual+Effects+2%5BH33T%5D%5Bsuperl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5370140429dff8d41197aa4e3b3614b2e2d0d5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,55,1,64,66,157,255,141,65,25,122,164,227,179,97,75,46,45,13,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
