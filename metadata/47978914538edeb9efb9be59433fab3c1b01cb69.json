Outlaw Happy Meals? Tax Twinkies? What's next? Affirmative action for cows?\nA catastrophe is looming. Farmers are raping the land and torturing animals. Food is riddled with deadly pesticides, hormones and foreign DNA. Corporate farms are wallowing in government subsidies. Meat packers and fast food restaurants are exploiting workers and tainting the food supply. And Paula Deen has diabetes!\nSomething must be done. So says an emerging elite in this country who think they know exactly what we should grow, cook and eat. They are the food police.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47978914538edeb9efb9be59433fab3c1b01cb69","amp;dn":"The+Food+Police%3A+A+Well-Fed+Manifesto+About+the+Politics+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47978914538edeb9efb9be59433fab3c1b01cb69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,151,137,20,83,142,222,185,239,185,190,89,67,63,171,60,27,1,203,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
