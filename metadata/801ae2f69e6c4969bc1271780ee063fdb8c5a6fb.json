We've also polished many parts of the experience. \nWe still do plan on patching the game again on the 31st, but it's clear to us now that this version is what we *should* have launched with on the 8th. \n\n-=MAJOR STUFF FIXED IN THIS VERSION=-\n(NOTE: there's a lot more than this that has been fixed, but these are the big things; we ran out of room in the annoucement text to list everything). \n\n-PERFORMANCE BREAKTHROUGH: We made a change to how shadows are rendered, with major improvements noted on Geforce GTX 650Ti and equivalent cards . Some shadow quality is lost, but we see this as a welcome trade-off. We will be adding a slider to you can customize this setting if you have a powerful rig.\n-Fixed case where the number of incapacitated fighters was reported as 100% when it really wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\n-Coming out of the VT, the door will now be closed after coming out of the VT, also fixed collision issue with not being able to shoot the traitor.\n-Fixed some players getting stuck in the medical bay on Pawn24\n-Fixed fighters looking messed up before the boarding or surrender threads\n-Fixed two Kirils showing up and breaking things badly if starting a fight with the mercs in the surrender thread\n-Fixed Hangar bay floor collision issues happening when fighting the mercs\n-Fixed it so that it's impossible for the virus hunt mission to still partially be active after it's shut down\n-Fixed energy charging station disabling/enabling logic from being able to trigger AFTER the traitor has been dealt with.\n-Fixed Pawn 12 stopping by the MedBay door and never moving again, blocking player.\n-Fixed being locked out of B8's cabin after the traitor situation\n-Fixed bug where Zenlil could get attacked and explode while K15 is delivering a speech.\n-Fixed it so that a large R25 conversation will properly disable K15 asking player to come talk with the Queen while it's ongoing.\n-Fixed player weapons breaking after waking up from the second dream sequence.\n-Various end game freefall fixes (K15/Traitor encounter flashback issues fixed, merc fight, preventing roaming the ship, Kiril non-progression bug fixed)\n-Cleaned up quantum limbo...\n-Fixed it so that the traitor's cell door will always be closed\n-P19 now reacts appropriately to EMP event\n-Instances of the weapon safety lock not turning off during the merc fight should be gone now...mercs will no longer be able to get into lower avionics. Let us know if this still occurs for you, and where/when exactly it happens please!\n-Additional fixes to end-game: finally fixed the non-progression that only some players were having with Kiril.\n-Made it impossible for the traitor killed/captured articles to show up near the beginning of the game.\n-Pawn 11 or Pawn 32 using consoles at rear of ship will no longer get the player stuck.\n-If R25 does not ask player who the murderer was, then the &quot;chose poorly&quot; achievement will NOT fire.\n-Fixed it so that if the player choose the correct npc as the traitor and then goes to sleep, the cabin will not lock\n-Fixed it so that R13 will properly leave B6's cabin after the P64 incident.\n-Fixed it so that Wade will no longer walk AWAY from the briefing room before the briefing starts\n-Fixed it so that it's impossible to trigger an incorrect convo with P32\n-Fixed traitor re-spawning and appearing in the hangar bay\n-Fixed getting stuck on pawn24 in the medical bay\n-No longer can get locked in the barracks near the end of the game\n-Fixed &quot;Enemy Mine&quot; achievement not firing\n-Fixed getting stuck on r25 during EMP scene\n-Major fixes/improvements/balancing to the traitor fight\n-Fixed the minigame reporting incorrect states of fighters for incaps vs deaths\n-Fixed it so that P32 will still go to R25 if player abandons the initial P32 convo in the hangar bay\n-Traitor is now immune to decompression\n-Fixed lights in elevator turning off completely sometimes when using the elevator.\n-Issue with pawn 64 getting stuck in barracks and blocking player fixed\n-Pawn 64 elevator issue fixed\n-Pawn 64 now properly gets up and leaves B6's cabin after the incident\n-Fixed it so that primary mission objectives will automatically cancel previous mission objectives, so old objectives will no longer show up after loading games.\n-Fixed save/load issue with the minigame, would cause incorrect stats being reported\n-Fixed player getting stuck in bots when they are on ladders\n-Fixed bots doing a disappearing act\n-Fixed various objects transitioning into _2 that should not have\n-Fixed consumables properly transitioning into _2\n-Characters will now walk around P1's dead body\n-Fixed up and polished both threads of the P64 incident, especially the ending of it..P64 and R13 will leave the scene correctly\n-Fixed up P52 and P64 issues around the chess board\n-Fixes for if K15 is shot\n-Fixed potential overlapping and zenlil destroying logic not shutting off if players got to mission ops quickly enough after dealing with Kiril\n-Fixed abandoning conversation with Kiril in hangar bay properly triggering fight\n-Fixed it so that when mercs are killed via decompression, they actually count as kills\n-Fixed recycables not transitioning after the minigame\n\n-=KNOWN ISSUES=-\n\n-Subtitles still need work. Some lines won't have subtitles, some subtitles are just wrong, and they sometimes &quot;double up&quot;. All to be fixed in an update soon...\n-Some performance issues remain. This version should run a lot better on many cards, but there are still known issues that we are working on.\n-Some HUD and inventory polish items remaining. We have an in-game HUD tutorial screen planned, in addition to further polish and tweaks to the usablity of the inventory.\n-Ongoing balancing work. We've made some significant changes to the balancing in this version, but more may be coming soon. Feel free to post in the Community HUB any thoughts you have on overall difficulty and game balance.\n\n That's all for now! We hope you enjoy this build... \n\n -=the iDGi and CONSORTIUM team=-\n \n \n 1. Install Consortium-RELOADED\n 2. Unpack CONSORTIUM.UPDATE.V.1.03.zip\n 3.
