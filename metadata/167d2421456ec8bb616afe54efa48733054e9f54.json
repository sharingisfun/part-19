It was produced by David Rubinson and Herbie Hancock, and was the final album featuring the core group of the Headhunters (Paul Jackson, Bill Summers, Harvey Mason, Bennie Maupin, and Mike Clark).\n\n\n Perhaps the funkiest album of Herbie Hancock's early- to mid-'70s jazz/funk/fusion era, Man-Child starts off with the unforgettable &quot;Hang Up Your Hang Ups,&quot; and the beat just keeps coming until the album's end. &quot;Sun Touch&quot; and &quot;Bubbles&quot; are slower, but funky nonetheless. Hancock is the star on his arsenal of keyboards, but guitarist Wah Wah Watson's presence is what puts a new sheen on this recording, distinguishing it from its predecessors, Head Hunters and Thrust. Others among the all-star cast of soloists and accompanists include Wayne Shorter on soprano sax, Stevie Wonder on chromatic harmonica, and longtime Hancock cohort Bennie Maupin on an arsenal of woodwinds.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Hang Up Your Hang Ups\n 02 - Sun Touch\n 03 - The Traitor\n 04 - Bubbles\n 05 - Steppin' In It\n 06 - Heartbeat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167d2421456ec8bb616afe54efa48733054e9f54","amp;dn":"Herbie+Hancock+-+Man-Child+%281975%2F2013%29+Official+DL+24bit%2F96khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167d2421456ec8bb616afe54efa48733054e9f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,125,36,33,69,110,200,187,97,106,254,84,239,164,135,51,5,78,159,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
