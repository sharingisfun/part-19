It is called a treasure trove of life because of the diverse animal life found there. Among this fauna are wild dogs that are rarely seen. They include the maned wolf, characterized by its long legs and mane, and the bush dog, with its short legs and long body enabling it to attack the underground burrows of armadillos. These wild dogs, which have adapted to the environment of the savanna, are being pushed to extinction by the expansion of farmland and the resulting changes in the environment. On the Edge of Survival traces how these very rarely photographed dogs live.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3896Kbps)\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.53 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 49 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.40 GB\r\nSource: HDTV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7274a3c163c02ef73d9b620e217d45aee03dd0c","amp;dn":"On+the+Edge+of+Survival+Brazils+Wild+Dogs+720p+HDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7274a3c163c02ef73d9b620e217d45aee03dd0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,39,74,60,22,60,2,239,115,217,182,32,226,23,212,90,238,3,221,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
