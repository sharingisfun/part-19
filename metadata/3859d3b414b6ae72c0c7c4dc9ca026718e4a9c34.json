In contrast to the group's previous recordings that were more influenced by psychedelic rock and punk rock, Dust contains music that is equally influenced by folk and blues, while still retaining a harder-edged sound. &quot;All I Know&quot; was released as a single from the album and became a success on rock radio. &quot;Dying Days&quot;, a song that was also released as a single to some minor success, features Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready.\n\nKerrang! Magazine selected Dust as the best album of 1996 in their year-end awards.[8] The band toured behind Dust for nearly two years (with former Kyuss and future Queens of the Stone Age leader Josh Homme serving as a touring guitarist), and afterwards went on an extended hiatus, eventually disbanding officially in 2000.\n\nAll songs written by Gary Lee Conner/Van Conner/Mark Lanegan except as indicated.\n\n&quot;Halo of Ashes&quot;  (Gary Lee Conner/Van Conner/Mark Lanegan/Barrett Martin) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n&quot;All I Know&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:55\n&quot;Look at You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:42\n&quot;Dying Days&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:51\n&quot;Make My Mind&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:11\n&quot;Sworn and Broken&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n&quot;Witness&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n&quot;Traveler&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:22\n&quot;Dime Western&quot;  (Gary Lee Conner/Van Conner/Mark Lanegan/Barrett Martin) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n&quot;Gospel Plow&quot;  (Gary Lee Conner/Van Conner/Mark Lanegan/Barrett Martin) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:17","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3859d3b414b6ae72c0c7c4dc9ca026718e4a9c34","amp;dn":"Screaming+Trees+-+Dust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3859d3b414b6ae72c0c7c4dc9ca026718e4a9c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,89,211,180,20,182,174,114,192,199,196,220,156,160,38,113,142,74,156,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
