The only clue left behind is a tiny bladed robot, nearly invisible to the human eye.\n \nIn the lush forests of Oahu, groundbreaking technology has ushered in a revolutionary era of biological prospecting. Trillions of microorganisms, tens of thousands of bacteria species, are being discovered; they are feeding a search for priceless drugs and applications on a scale beyond anything previously imagined.\n \nIn Cambridge, Massachusetts, seven graduate students at the forefront of their fields are recruited by a pioneering microbiology start-up. Nanigen MicroTechnologies dispatches the group to a mysterious lab in Hawaii, where they are promised access to tools that will open a whole new scientific frontier.\n \nBut once in the Oahu rain forest, the scientists are thrust into a hostile wilderness that reveals profound and surprising dangers at every turn. Armed only with their knowledge of the natural world, they find themselves prey to a technology of radical and unbridled power. To survive, they must harness the inherent forces of nature itself.\n \nAn instant classic, Micro pits nature against technology in vintage Crichton fashion. Completed by visionary science writer Richard Preston, this boundary-pushing thriller melds scientific fact with pulse-pounding fiction to create yet another masterpiece of sophisticated, cutting-edge entertainment.\n \nGenre: Thriller\n \n\nEPUB, LIT, MOBI, LRF \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c14ac050f8ee5f2e5f4e0d022954df910e1ee9","amp;dn":"Michael+Crichton+%26amp%3B+Richard+Preston+-+Micro%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c14ac050f8ee5f2e5f4e0d022954df910e1ee9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,193,74,192,80,248,238,95,46,95,78,13,2,41,84,223,145,14,30,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
