It explores the struggle for democracy against the Council of Five's belief in the system and the great lengths they will go to maintain their power.\n\nIn particular it explores Dredd's participation in the crushing of the democratic movement and his later doubts and misgivings about his past actions and the very system he has sworn to protect.\n\n\nIncluded in the files are the acclaimed &quot;America&quot; series, often cited as the best Dredd stories ever written and illustrated.\n\n\nI have collated this series and offer great thanks to the original up loaders.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4235d1cac9274d9b8caf7f647e1df44a70f381","amp;dn":"Judge+Dredd+-+Grand+Hall+of+Justice+versus+Democracy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4235d1cac9274d9b8caf7f647e1df44a70f381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,66,53,209,202,201,39,77,155,140,175,127,100,126,29,244,74,112,243,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
