She examines their eastern origins and discusses their dissemination throughout the mainland and Crete. She also analyses their function as magical devices which ward off evil and questions why a female god was the protectress of men rather than women.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c656615905f3a2849905b195896742e1c2e2e77e","amp;dn":"The+Goddess+and+the+Warrior%3A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c656615905f3a2849905b195896742e1c2e2e77e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,86,97,89,5,243,162,132,153,5,177,149,137,103,66,225,194,226,231,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
