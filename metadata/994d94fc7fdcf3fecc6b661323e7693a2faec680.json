XHTML is HTML 4.0 rewritten in XML; it provides the precision of XML while retaining the flexibility of HTML. HTML &amp;amp; XHTML: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition, brings it all together. It's the most comprehensive book available on HTML and XHTML today. It covers Netscape Navigator 6.0, Internet Explorer 5.0, HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, JavaScript, Style sheets, Layers, and all of the features supported by the popular web browsers.\n\nLearning HTML and XHTML is like learning any new language, computer or human. Most students first immerse themselves in examples. Studying others is a natural way to learn, making learning easy and fun. Imitation can take learning only so far, though. It's as easy to learn bad habits through imitation as it is to acquire good ones. The better way to become HTML-fluent is through a comprehensive reference that covers the language syntax, semantics, and variations in detail and demonstrates the difference between good and bad usage.\n\nHTML &amp;amp; XHTML: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition, helps in both ways: the authors cover every element of HTML/XHTML in detail, explaining how each element works and how it interacts with other elements. Many hints about HTML/XHTML style smooth the way for writing documents that range from simple online documentation to complex presentations. With hundreds of examples, the book gives web authors models for writing their own effective web pages and for mastering advanced features, like style sheets and frames.\n\nHTML &amp;amp; XHTML: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition, shows how to:\n\n    * Implement the XHTML 1.0 standard and prepare web pages for the transition to XML browsers\n\n    * Use style sheets and layers to control a document's appearance\n\n    * Create tables, from simple to complex\n\n    * Use frames to coordinate sets of documents\n\n    * Design and build interactive forms and dynamic documents\n\n    * Insert images, sound files, video, Java applets, and JavaScript programs\n\n    * Create documents that look good on a variety of browsers\n\n\n\nThe book comes with a handy quick reference card listing HTML tags.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:994d94fc7fdcf3fecc6b661323e7693a2faec680","amp;dn":"HTML+%26+XHTML+The+Definitive+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"994d94fc7fdcf3fecc6b661323e7693a2faec680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,77,148,252,127,220,243,254,204,107,102,19,35,231,105,58,47,174,198,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
