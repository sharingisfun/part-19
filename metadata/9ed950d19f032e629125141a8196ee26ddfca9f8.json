Karen has carried the burden of responsibility for her aging mother ever since her gorgeous sister left town years ago to pursue a career in theater. But Val had darker reasons for leaving town-as well as a secret to keep-and coming home has never been an option . . . until their mother suffers a stroke.\nReunited in their hometown, Karen and Val must grapple with their past mistakes, their relationship with each other, and their issues with a mother who is far from ideal. When a physical therapist raising his daughter alone and a handsome but hurting musician enter the picture, the summer takes on a whole new dimension. As their lives intersect and entwine, can each learn how to forgive, how to let go, and how to move on? And strengthened by the healing power of faith, might they also find the courage to love?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ed950d19f032e629125141a8196ee26ddfca9f8","amp;dn":"Irene+Hannon-That+Certain+Summer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ed950d19f032e629125141a8196ee26ddfca9f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,217,80,209,159,3,46,98,145,37,20,26,129,150,238,38,221,252,169,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
