He is able to secure a date with the girl, Mercedes, and it is assumed he will drive. But, he doesn't have his license yet. When it comes time for his driving test, he fails. He doesn't want to risk the chance at going out with Mercedes, so he decides to go anyway. Not only does he disobey his parents by going in the first place, but he takes his grandfather's prized possession - his Cadillac. Will he get through the night without wrecking the car, and get away with sneaking out, or will his plan collapse?\n\n\n\nLanguage: English 5.1, 2.0\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1 \nWidescreen: 16:9\nNTSC\n\n\nUntouched\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb850f9431342f1387430d6f09ec7886b989104d","amp;dn":"License+To+Drive+%281988%29++DVD-R++NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb850f9431342f1387430d6f09ec7886b989104d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,133,15,148,49,52,47,19,135,67,13,111,9,236,120,134,185,137,16,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
