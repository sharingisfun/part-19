CDs 7 8 9\n\nRecorded live at Winterland Arena San Francisco, CA June 9 1977. \n\nAs David Lemieux, the veteran Dead archivist and producer of this Box Set puts it, A lot of Dead Heads say that 1977 is their favorite year. And of these shows, the first night is a Top 15, the second is a Top 10 and the third is a Top 3.\n\nFor a lot of heads, not just hardcore tapers and set list scholars, but the true and new believers who have heard and shared these gigs for more than 30 yearsÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª \nit doesnÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t get any better than this. \n\nNot my rip but verified with Audiochecker V1.2.  All tracks CDDA with probability 100%. All tracks properly tagged with Artwork embedded.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b14834b2ee72d0cf330c6457631f2f07b7c56bc","amp;dn":"GRATEFUL+DEAD+Wonderland+Box+Set+San+Francisco+CA+6-9-77+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b14834b2ee72d0cf330c6457631f2f07b7c56bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,20,131,75,46,231,45,12,243,48,198,69,118,49,242,240,123,124,86,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
