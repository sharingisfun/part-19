He had more money than God and more women than any man could need. But when a night of debauchery ends in tragedy, he forfeits a life of luxury for a ten-year prison sentence at La Rosa, CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most violent prison.\n\nTO A BRUTAL BEAST\nEight years later, a ruthless, cunning man runs La Rosa from the inside. He is known simply as BEAST. All the wardens fear him. All the gangs obey him. He speaks to no one but his inner council. What he says is law.\n\nNOW ONLY SHE CAN SAVE HIM\nAnnabelle MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father is the warden at La Rosa. He deals as dirty as his trustees, and after years of smooth relations with Beast and the gangs he runs, Holt lands on the powerful prisonerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hit list. That very afternoon, Annabelle pays a surprise visit to her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, hoping to use her new counseling license at a place she thinks she could make a difference. When she catches BeastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye, he releases the warden and grabs the daughter. The price for the wardenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s error is not death. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his precious Belle.\n\n- - -\n\nBook 2 - Beast, Part II\n\nContinue the dark, erotic journey of Annabelle, the warden's daughter, and the man she's pined for since her girlhood. No longer Cal Hammond, actor, Beast is a brutal man who runs the prison's gangs from behind a shroud of secrecy and lies. Can Annabelle's love save him from his tainted past, or will his deceit ruin both of them?\n\n- - -\n\nBoth books come in EPUB, MOBI, and AZW3 formats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee7729198b9673ba68dc45737f0f2af64b5fd32","amp;dn":"Beast+Series+%28Books+1%2C2%29+-+Ella+James","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee7729198b9673ba68dc45737f0f2af64b5fd32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,231,114,145,152,185,103,59,166,141,196,87,55,240,242,175,100,181,253,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
