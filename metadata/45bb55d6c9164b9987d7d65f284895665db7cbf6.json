The scene is a small Chilean saltpetre mining town in 1907. Suffering under the despotic rule of the British mine owners, the workers stage a revolt. The government's solution is to utterly destroy the town rather than allow the rebellion to spread. Director Miguel Littin adapted Letters from Marusia from a novel by Patricio Manns, which in turn was based on eyewitness accounts of the 1907 massacre.\n\n\nNominated for the Golden palm and Oscar.\n\n\nDirector:  Miguel Littin\nWriters:   Miguel Littin, Patricio Manns\nStarring:  Gian Maria VolontÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Armando Acosta, Arturo BeristÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡in, Diana Bracho,\n           Ernesto Gomez Cruz, Salvador Sanchez, Claudio Obregon,\n           Patricio Castillo, Domingo Soto\nGenre:     Drama\nCountry:   Mexico\nYear:      1976\nLanguage:  Spanish\nRuntime:   110 min\nVideo:     AVI, SATRip, 576x432, XviD MPEG-4, 1656 kbps\nAudio:     44100 Hz, 2(stereo), MP3, 128 kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45bb55d6c9164b9987d7d65f284895665db7cbf6","amp;dn":"Actas+de+Marusia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45bb55d6c9164b9987d7d65f284895665db7cbf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,187,85,214,201,22,75,153,135,215,214,95,40,72,149,102,93,183,203,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
