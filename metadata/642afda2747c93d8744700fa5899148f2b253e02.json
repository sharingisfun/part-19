These sessions are usually very interesting, but it would be wrong to expect new sensations. The more I was surprised when I saw the two sessions of Rory Gallagher and Albert Collins. Maybe it is their respect for each other which drives these two guitarists to give remarkable shows again and again . After the opening number at the Nyon Folk Festival which was a blues medley, the whole session turned out to be a mixture of jazz and rock and it was also a mixture of two kinds of modern blues. \n\n\n01. Good Golly Miss Molly (3.40)\n02. I Got a Cold Cold Feeling (7.54)\n03. Goin' Down Slow Jam (10.44)\n04. Whiskey And Women Jam (17.46)\n05. Boogie Jam (9.02)\n06.
