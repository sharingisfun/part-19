The present volume provides comprehensive reviews of the chemistry and bioactivity of selected groups of heterocycles and natural products. â€¦ Overall, this book covers in detail several classes of bioactive heterocyclic compounds including selected natural products. The focus is on the most recent advances, and the clarity of the presentation is very good. It should be of interest to individuals interested in the discovery and synthesis of bioactive small molecules, including research scientists in academia and industry. I would expect this book to be a standard reference in university and industrial libraries.&quot; (Gary Sulikowski, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 129 (15), 2007)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b67dacc4e5536bf7bf1c35c8ca1cff8508c89cb0","amp;dn":"Bioactive+Heterocycles+I+-+Shoji+Eguchi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b67dacc4e5536bf7bf1c35c8ca1cff8508c89cb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,125,172,196,229,83,107,247,191,28,53,200,202,28,255,133,8,200,156,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
