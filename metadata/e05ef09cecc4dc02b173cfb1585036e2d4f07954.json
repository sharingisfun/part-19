Astronomy Today has been shortened (from 30 to 28 chapters), but retains its informal-but-scientific writing style, and exceptional art program. Its unique subscription program COMETS now includes computer-generated animations from NASA illustrator Dana Berry. Astronomy Today employs the familiar planets-sun-stars- galaxies organization. Key concepts are introduced in the familiar context of the Earth and solar system; the concepts are carefully developed as discussion moves outward towards the stars and galaxies. A highly praised approach to spectroscopy and light (topics often difficult for students) and outstanding treatment of active galaxies and cosmology are other highlights. Written for non-science college students, this book is highly recommended for anyone interested in astronomy. Its breath, clarity, superb illustrations and software are first rate. Prentice Hall appears to hvae repurposed this text for amateur astronomers in another book, Astronomy: A Beginner's Guide to the Universe, which is nearly identical, albeit abbreviated in areas. Both books are an excellent value and users need to decide whether the academic version is worth more. Having read &quot;Astronomy Today&quot; cover to cover, there is much than can be shortened, such as when the authors discuss difficulties encountered in obtaining astronomy knowledge, rather than the knowledge itself. Its generous illustrations reinforce much of the text, taking this philosophy further, it could have been that much of the text could take a back seat to more detailed illustrations. Nevertheless a marvelous job!\n\nCONTENTS\nPart 1: Astronomy and the Universe\nChapter 1: Charting the Heavens\nChapter 2: The Copernican Revolution\nChapter 3: Radiation\nChapter 4: Spectroscopy\nChapter 5: Telescopes\nPart 2: Our Planetary System\nChapter 6: The Solar System\nChapter 7: Earth\nChapter 8: The Moon and Mercury\nChapter 9: Venus\nChapter 10: Mars\nChapter 11: Jupiter\nChapter 12: Saturn\nChapter 13: Uranus and Neptune\nChapter 14: Solar System Debris\nChapter 15: The Formation of Planetar\nPart 3: Stars and Stellar Evolution\nChapter 16: The Sun\nChapter 17: The Stars\nChapter 18: The Interstellar Medium\nChapter 19: Star Formation\nChapter 20: Stellar Evolution\nChapter 21: Stellar Explosions\nChapter 22: Neutron Stars and Black I\nPart 4: Galaxies and Cosmology\nChapter 23: The Milky Way Galaxy\nChapter 24: Galaxies\nChapter 25: Galaxies and Dark Matter\nChapter 26: Cosmology\nChapter 27: The Early Universe\nChapter 28: Life in the Universe\nAppendix\nGlossary\nAnswers\nIndex\nStar Charts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e05ef09cecc4dc02b173cfb1585036e2d4f07954","amp;dn":"Astronomy+Today+%287th+Ed%29%282010%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e05ef09cecc4dc02b173cfb1585036e2d4f07954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,94,240,156,236,196,220,2,177,115,207,177,88,80,54,226,212,240,121,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
