For fans who didn&amp;#039;t purchase individual albums, though, this is a good overall view of their work. The tender &quot;Keepin&amp;#039; Me Out of the Storm&quot; shows a different side of the rockers; it&amp;#039;s melodic and would fit well on Quiet Storm formats. Rare Earth excelled at remaking tunes and putting their own stamp on them, as they do on &quot;Chained,&quot; made famous by Marvin Gaye. Lead singer Peter Hoorelbeke had a powerful voice that didn&amp;#039;t take a back seat to anybody&amp;#039;s.\n\n\n\n01. Get Ready                                                    \n02.
