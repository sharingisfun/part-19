Avoiding the dogmatism that has defined both extremes in the recent Science Wars and presenting a conception of reason that lifts the discussion out of the interminable debates about objectivity and neutrality, Tauber offers a way of understanding science as an evolving relationship between facts and the values that govern their discovery and applications.\n\nThis timely philosophy of science presents a centrist but highly consequential view, wherein truth and objectivity can function as working ideals and serve as pragmatic tools within the sociological context in which they reside. For if the humanization of science is to reach completion, it must reveal not only the meaning it receives from its social and cultural settings but also that which it lends to them.Packed with well-chosen case studies, Science and the Quest for Meaning is a trust-worthy and engaging introduction to the history of, and the current debate surrounding, the philosophy of science.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction: Concerning Scientific Reason\n1.
