Altoist Art Pepper is heard on a lyrical and emotional version of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; (the only selection that has Charlie Haden on bass). Tenor great Zoot Sims swings on &quot;In the Middle of a Kiss,&quot; &quot;Broadway&quot; and &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;; the latter two songs also feature guitarist Barney Kessel. But the main reason to acquire this disc is to hear Sims and Pepper jamming together on &quot;Wee&quot; and &quot;Breakdown Blues.&quot; The rhythm section of pianist Victor Feldman, bassist Ray Brown and drummer Billy Higgins is as tight, alert and hard-swinging as one would expect, and it is a joy to hear this rare encounter by the two great saxophonists. It is only a pity that Pepper and Sims did not record together more extensively during their careers.\n\n\nArt Pepper - Alto (Tracks 1,2 &amp; 6)\nZoot Sims - Tenor (Tracks 1,3,4,5 &amp; 6)\nBarney Kessel - Guitar (Tracks 4 &amp; 5)\nVictor Feldman - Piano\nRay Brown - Bass\nBilly Higgins - Drums\nCharlie Haden replaces Ray Brown on Track 2.\n\n\n01.
