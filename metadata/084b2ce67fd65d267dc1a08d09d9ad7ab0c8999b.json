This time, she encapsulates Greek myths, dreams, folklore, storytelling, insect parties, gossiping, a strange fascination for Commodore 64 computer games, and even UFOs... all with her usual ghostly sense of humour. However, songs such as Mind of Gold, and Follow touch on her more sensitive nature of the wonderings of life. Her Greek influences shine through even more so than the first, as her bouzouki is present in most of the songs.\n\nThe single 'Mind of Gold' and album track 'Bubbles' were produced by Mike Lindsay of Tunng. Giving them an almost euphoric feel, he compliments the songs in more ways than one, with his unpredictable arrangements and the enforcement of unusual instruments! A determined and passionate singer, songwriter and performer who is self promoting, self distributing, self managing, self producing. A true &quot;indie&quot; musician.\n\nAvailable through all good digital online music stores, including iTunes and Amazon mp3. CDs will be available at gigs so make sure you get to one if you want the lovely artwork, created by bass player and graphic designer Steve Rodgers\n\nCD RIPPED BY EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/28/jokers-daughter/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/28/jokers-daughter/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:084b2ce67fd65d267dc1a08d09d9ad7ab0c8999b","amp;dn":"Joker%5C%27s+Daughter...May+Cause+Side+Effects%292011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"084b2ce67fd65d267dc1a08d09d9ad7ab0c8999b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,75,44,230,127,214,93,38,125,193,160,141,9,217,173,122,176,200,153,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
