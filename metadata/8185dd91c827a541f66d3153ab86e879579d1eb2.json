Trumpets, swirling and pulsating keyboards, cool drum programming and airy, vocals abound on TRICKLE. It&amp;#039;s almost an anything goes mix of cool ideas. Consisting of twelve songs mostly written by band members Tim Kellett and Ruth-Ann (vocals), some of the shining moments include &quot;Smile&quot;, &quot;Love Affair&quot; and &quot;Speak To Me&quot;. \n\n&quot;I&amp;#039;m Not In Love&quot;, a cover of the 10cc&amp;#039;s song also appears on the album, though you might be familiar with it since it was included on Madonna&amp;#039;s The Next Big Thing soundtrack. It&amp;#039;s a trippy, up-tempo Electronica version of the classic song. TRICKLE is packed with interesting songs and cool vibes. Also check for &quot;Liberty&quot; and &quot;Trust You&quot;. \n\nProducers: Tim Kellett, Roger Lyons, Peter John Vettese. \n\nOlive: Ruth-Ann (vocals); Tim Kellett (trumpet, flugelhorn, keyboards). \n\nTrack Listing: \n1.
