We all prefer the more natural speech of contemporary performances, especially in the Comedies, but this captures  the spirit of the play. A useful comparison is the Argo version, made two years previously in 1962, with Gielgud and Ashcroft (readily and freely available on Spotify, and other other mp3 sites)\n\nTo quote a paraphrase of the introduction to the Arden edition-\n''Much Ado About Nothing boasts one of Shakespeare's most delightful heroines, most dancing wordplay, and the endearing spectacle of intellectual and social self-importance bested by the desire to love and be loved in return. It offers both the dancing wit of the &quot;merry war&quot; between the sexes, and a sobering vision of the costs of that combat for both men and women. Shakespeare dramatizes a social world in all of its vibrant particulars, in which characters are shaped by the relations between social convention and individual choice.'' (tks Duke2347)\n\nIt's always best to submit to natural instinct isn't it?\n\n(Kindly seed, and if you can't find a seed for any previous poetry torrent go to the folder 'Current Poetry Torrents' and follow the instructions on the pdf.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1360170157f46a2e0db6dc33d705f3bc2ca96d09","amp;dn":"William+Shakespeare+-+6+-+Much+Ado+-+Caedmon+1964","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1360170157f46a2e0db6dc33d705f3bc2ca96d09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,96,23,1,87,244,106,46,13,182,220,51,215,5,243,188,44,169,109,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
