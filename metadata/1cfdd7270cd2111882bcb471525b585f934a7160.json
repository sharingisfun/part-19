You can not control your subjects directly; instead you focus on city-building, resource management, diplomacy, heroes, magic and other things a\ntypical king deals with on a daily basis.\nThe game is very flexible: you can build up a powerful ream and rule the lands with an iron grip, or establish a humble fishermen's village. Or create a trading empire. Or found a small, bur well-defended outpost or raider's camp. Or become a host of a wizard's manor.\nAll characters, from a hauler to a hero have their own minds and behavior patterns. Sometimes it is interesting just to watch people scurry about minding their own business","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cfdd7270cd2111882bcb471525b585f934a7160","amp;dn":"Hearthlands+v0.7.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cfdd7270cd2111882bcb471525b585f934a7160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,253,215,39,12,210,17,24,130,188,180,113,82,91,88,95,147,74,113,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
