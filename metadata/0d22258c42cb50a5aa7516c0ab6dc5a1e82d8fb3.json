The film focuses on the gripping story of seven men and their emotional journey back into society and efforts to rebuild their lives. Included are a police officer, an army sergeant and a young father sent to prison and even death row for decades for crimes they did not commit.\n\nThe men are thrust back into society with little or no support from the system that put them behind bars. \n\nWhile the public views exonerations as success stories (wrongs that have been righted), AFTER INNOCENCE shows that the human toll of wrongful imprisonment can last far longer than the sentences served.\n\nThe film raises basic questions about human rights and society's moral obligation to the innocent and places a spotlight on the flaws in a criminal justice system that lead to wrongful conviction of the innocent.\n\n===========================\n\nOriginal Release : 2005\nGCJM Release : 14.05.2009\nSource : DvD1 - NTSC\nGenre : Documentary\n\nSize : 693 GB\nVideo : XVid - 818 kbps\nResolution : 624x352\nFramerate : 29.971 fps\nAudio : MP3 - 192 kbps - vbr - stereo - English\nSample : 48000 Hz\nSubtitles : N/A\nRuntime : 01:35:57\nProducers / Writers : Jessica Sanders &amp; Marc Simon\nDirector : Jessica Sanders\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d22258c42cb50a5aa7516c0ab6dc5a1e82d8fb3","amp;dn":"After+Innocence+-+LIMITED+-+DvDRip+-+GCJM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d22258c42cb50a5aa7516c0ab6dc5a1e82d8fb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,34,37,140,66,203,80,165,170,117,22,192,171,109,197,161,232,45,143,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
