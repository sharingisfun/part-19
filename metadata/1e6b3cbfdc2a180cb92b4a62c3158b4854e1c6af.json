The band was one of the most popular of the 1980s thrash metal scene and is notable for being the first to combine heavy metal with rap music. When thrash metal began to gain a major following in the mid-late 1980s, Anthrax were dubbed one of the &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal alongside Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpreading the Disease 1985\n\n\nSpreading the Disease is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax and the first with vocalist Joey Belladonna and bassist Frank Bello. The album was released in October 1985 by Megaforce Worldwide/Island in the United States and in March 1986 by Island Records globally.\n\nThe band produced the album with Carl Canedy, Jon Zazula serving as executive producer. The album includes the single &quot;Madhouse&quot;.\n\nA music video was produced for &quot;Madhouse&quot; as well, but didn't receive much airplay because it was banned by MTV, who believed the content to be degrading to the mentally ill.\n\nThis was the last Anthrax album to feature songwriting from fired vocalist Neil Turbin, who is given songwriting credit on the songs &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Gung-Ho&quot;. Songwriting credit was shared to the track &quot;Medusa&quot;, the first and only songwriting contribution from former producer Jon Zazula. Originally he was credited as the sole writer of the song, but reissues credited the rest of the band to it as well.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;A.I.R.&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Lone Justice&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Madhouse&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;S.S.C./Stand or Fall&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;The Enemy&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Aftershock&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Medusa&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Gung-Ho&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the Living  1987\n\n\nAmong the Living is the third studio album by American thrash metal band Anthrax. The album was released in March 1987 by Megaforce Worldwide/Island and is certified Gold by the RIAA.\n\nThe band and Eddie Kramer produced the album. The album includes the singles, &quot;I Am the Law&quot; and &quot;Indians&quot;.\n\nAmong the Living features a drawing of Reverend Henry Kane, from the film Poltergeist II: The Other Side, tipping his hat.\n\nThis was the last album to feature songwriting by original bassist Danny Lilker, who, despite having left the band after 1984's Fistful of Metal, was continuously credited as the co-writer of certain songs for the next two albums. On Among the Living, he is credited as the co-writer of the songs &quot;I Am the Law&quot; and &quot;Imitation of Life.&quot;\n\nThe album was dedicated to the memory of Cliff Burton.\n\nIn 2000 the album was released in Germany as a double album along with Persistence of Time.\n\nOn Anthrax's re-union tour in 2005 the majority of their concert set consisted of material from Among the Living, while on their 2006 tour at solo-dates they performed the album in its entirety.\n\nOn November 10th, a deluxe edition of the album will be released with bonus tracks and the DVD, Oidivnikufesin.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Among the Living&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Caught in a Mosh&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;I Am the Law&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;A Skeleton in the Closet&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Indians&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;One World&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;A.D.I./Horror of It All&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Imitation of Life&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistence of Time 1990\n\n\nPersistence of Time is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax. The album was released in 1990 by Megaforce Worldwide/Island Entertainment.\n\nThe album includes the singles, &quot;Got the Time&quot; (a Joe Jackson cover) and &quot;In My World&quot; (which was performed by the band on an episode of Married...With Children.)\n\nAnthrax returned to the studio in the fall of 1989 with Mark Dodson (who produced the previous album, State of Euphoria) to start work on their fifth album. Recording of the album was difficult, with a large structure fire causing the band to lose more than $100,000 worth of gear and their recording studio in January 1990. Following their personal disaster the band moved to a different studio in late February of that year to finish work on the album.\n\nThe lyrical focus of Persistence of Time is the need for tolerance and peace. This would be the last Anthrax studio album to feature Joey Belladonna on vocals. The introduction to the song &quot;Intro to Reality&quot; featured dialogue from an episode of The Twilight Zone called &quot;Deaths-Head Revisited&quot;.\n\nThe beginning riff on &quot;Belly of the Beast&quot; (The Greater of Two Evils version featuring John Bush) is from the Celtic Frost song &quot;Dethroned Emperor&quot;, which Anthrax themselves later did a cover of, which appeared on the EP Summer 2003 and as a bonus track on certain editions of Stomp 442.\n\nPersistence of Time was certified gold by the RIAA. Its highest Billboard Music Chart position was #24 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nNew York Times (11/18/90) - &quot;..the music carries the exhilaration of a desperate struggle.&quot;\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Time&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Blood&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Keep It in the Family&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;In My World&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Gridlock&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Intro to Reality&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Belly of the Beast&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Got the Time&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;H8 Red&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;One Man Stands&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Discharge&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSound of White Noise 1993\n\n\nSound of White Noise is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax, released in May 1993 on Elektra Records. It is the band's first album with former Armored Saint vocalist John Bush, and also their last studio album with guitarist Dan Spitz.\n\nThe band and Dave Jerden produced the album, which includes the singles, &quot;Only&quot;,&quot;Black Lodge&quot;, &quot;Room for One More&quot; and &quot;Hy Pro Glo&quot;. This album marked a change in the sound of the band, mixing the old thrash metal with new grunge references (Dave Jerden was the producer of Alice in Chains) and the album got Anthrax's highest ever chart position, debuting at #7 on the Billboard 200 charts, with &quot;Only&quot; and &quot;Room For One More&quot; in particular becoming major rock radio hits at their time. Sound of White Noise was certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nAnthrax also contributed a song from these sessions called &quot;Poison My Eyes&quot; 7:05 to the Last Action Hero soundtrack.\n\nThe title &quot;C11H17N2O2S Na&quot; is the chemical formula for sodium pentathol. The closing of the album, which appears at the end of the song &quot;This Is Not an Exit&quot; includes a sample from the 1991 movie &quot;My Girl&quot;.\n\nA music video was produced for &quot;Black Lodge&quot;, which features Jenna Elfman as the lead role in one of her first film appearances. The Black Lodge is a fictional place from the television series Twin Peaks, which Twin Peaks's score conductor Angelo Badalamenti helped write.\n\nThis was released on LP in Europe (Catalog Number 7559-61430-1). The song &quot;Black Lodge&quot; was omitted from this vinyl release due to time.\n\nThe band gave an interview in Metal Edge Magazine before release about the influence of Bret Easton Ellis' &quot;American Psycho&quot; novel in making this album. The ending track &quot;This Is Not an Exit&quot; is directly from the novel.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Potter's Field&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Only&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Room for One More&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Packaged Rebellion&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Hy Pro Glo&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Invisible&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;1000 Points of Hate&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Black Lodge&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;C11H17N2O2S Na&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Burst&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;This Is Not an Exit&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStomp 442  1995\n\n\nStomp 442 is the name of the seventh album by American heavy metal band Anthrax. It was released in 1995, (see 1995 in music) by Elektra Records. The band and Butcher Brothers produced the album, which includes the singles, &quot;Fueled&quot; and &quot;Nothing&quot;. The album debuted at #47 on the Billboard 200 charts. Anthrax claimed that their label, Elektra Records didn't do enough to promote the album, and they left soon after. Stomp 442 is the only Anthrax album not featuring the traditional Anthrax logo.\n\nStomp 442 is also Anthrax's first album without Dan Spitz on lead guitar. Though not yet credited as a member of the band, Paul Crook took over lead guitar duties\n\n\nTracks:  \n\n1.\t&quot;Random Acts of Senseless Violence&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Fueled&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;King Size&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Riding Shotgun&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Perpetual Motion&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;In a Zone&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Nothing&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;American Pompeii&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Drop the Ball&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Tester&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Bare&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolume 8 The Threat is Real 1998\n\n\nVolume 8: The Threat is Real! is the eighth studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax.
