David Lloyd, the artist on V for Vendetta, said Whitaker was not only one of the finest colourists Britain has ever produced, but a great artist, a scholar of the comics medium, and a great teacher, too, who I worked with at The London Cartoon Centre in it's various incarnations. Whitaker had been an active member of the British Amateur Press Association until it was disbanded in 2004. Following his death, ex-member Tony Keen announced he would organise a one-off memorial mailing, as he had for fellow BAPAn Andy Roberts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f0341dfc56b57f5357363e913d9363f6ff8ee5","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Cartooning+Techniques+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f0341dfc56b57f5357363e913d9363f6ff8ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,240,52,29,252,86,181,127,83,87,54,62,145,61,147,99,246,255,142,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
