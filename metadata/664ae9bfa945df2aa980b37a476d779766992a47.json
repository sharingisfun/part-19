Russell's ideas were considered horrifically immoral and he was roundly condemned for their publication.\n\nThis book should be read by anyone who's thoughtful and considering alternate sexual moralities. Russell covers a lot of ground and brings up many important points.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:664ae9bfa945df2aa980b37a476d779766992a47","amp;dn":"Marriage+And+Morals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"664ae9bfa945df2aa980b37a476d779766992a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,74,233,191,169,69,223,42,169,128,179,122,71,109,119,151,102,153,42,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
