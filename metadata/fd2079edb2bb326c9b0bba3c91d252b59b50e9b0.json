All releases are made from the first generation master tape and mastered at half-speed, allowing for the finest sound quality possible. In the past, MFSL has produced cassette tapes, LPs, CDs, and even VHS releases of a few titles. In addition, each title is licensed to be mastered, manufactured, and sold within a specific time frame, and because of the limited quantities produced, the releases are highly sought after by collectors.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2079edb2bb326c9b0bba3c91d252b59b50e9b0","amp;dn":"Nirvana+-+Nevermind+%28MFSL%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2079edb2bb326c9b0bba3c91d252b59b50e9b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,32,121,237,178,187,50,108,155,11,186,60,145,210,82,181,155,80,233,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
