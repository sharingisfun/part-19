He exists before the foundation of the world.\n\nIshmael goes back to the One who came from heaven and was incarnated for him. Yes, my God and my Savior, You came to preach the Good News to the poor, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness the prisoners, to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. \n\nYou came to rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; we will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations, and proclaim freedom, peace, healing, and love.  Oh, my God and Savior, You came to save all nations. \n\nWe, the children of Ishmael, have lived so many years unaware of you, knowing nothing about you, and many times we not only denied you but also were hostile to you and fought against you . But your love that is beyond all minds, all imagination, and beyond all enmity found us, guided us, had mercy upon us, and purified us.\n\nYour love, my Savior, brought us back to You as the prodigal to the bosom of his father, as a foundling returns to his motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bosom, as a drowning person brought back to the ship of rescue.\n\nMy God and my Savior, here we are; we sought You and You found us; we asked You and You answered us; we prayed to You and You have heard our prayers. You have loved us first.\n\nNow we have become sons, not slaves; free, not captives. We became righteous instead of being wicked; we became like you in loving all the nations.\n\nWe are the Children of Ishmael, the son of our father Abraham, who was called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the friend of GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. We decided on the coming few pages to proclaim to all nations our love, admiration and submission and loyalty to You.  We are the branches and You are the vine; we are the bride and You are the groom; we are your city and You are our God, Savior and King.\n\nYours, \nThe Children of Ishmael&quot;\n\n\n(&quot;The Children Of Ishmael&quot;; Introduction)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a26a08166e9b517d2362a44684d37427abe8a5a9","amp;dn":"The+Children+of+Ishmael+%28E-Books%29+Language+English+%26+Arabic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a26a08166e9b517d2362a44684d37427abe8a5a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,106,8,22,110,155,81,125,35,98,164,70,132,211,116,39,171,232,165,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
