His latest, Too Many Years... (Relix Records 2094: 68:23), includes faithful renditions of Fred McDowell's &quot;You Got to Move,&quot; Funny Paper Smith's &quot;Fools Blues&quot; and Rev. Gary Davis' &quot;Say No to the Devil.&quot; An accomplished fingerstyle acoustic player, as he demonstrates on Johnny Cash's &quot;Home of the Blues,&quot; Kaukonen is joined here by organist-pianist Pete Sears and second guitarist-mandolin player Michael Falzarano. He breaks out the electric guitar on his &quot;Hypnotation Blues,&quot; on a Chet Atkins-styled arrangement of &quot;Nine Pound Hammer&quot; and a jumped-up boogie rendition of the Grateful Dead's &quot;Friend of the Devil.&quot; He also shows off some serious slide guitar and pedal steel technique along the way. An intimate gem.
