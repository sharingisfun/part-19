He interviewed soldiers, psychologists, gangsters, astronauts, and anarchists and discovered the ways that people are using philosophy now to build better lives. Ancient philosophy has inspired modern communities Ã¢â‚¬â€ Socratic cafes, Stoic armies, Epicurean communes Ã¢â‚¬â€ and even whole nations in the quest for the good life.\n\n This book is an invitation to a dream school with a rowdy faculty that includes twelve of the greatest philosophers from the ancient world, sharing their lessons on happiness, resilience, and much more. Lively and inspiring, this is philosophy for the street, for the workplace, for the battlefield, for love, for life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b2ad4d6005a2b7c9a286af3f82e2dc400f75aa","amp;dn":"Philosophy+for+Life+and+Other+Dangerous+Situations+%282013%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b2ad4d6005a2b7c9a286af3f82e2dc400f75aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,178,173,77,96,5,162,183,201,162,134,175,63,130,226,220,64,15,117,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
