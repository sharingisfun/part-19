Drawing on the views of academic experts, BBC documentaries and drama, Vanessa charts how, throughout history, Cleopatra's image has been subject to myth, clichÃƒÂ© and propaganda.\n\n\nFirst broadcasts: 10 Feb 2015\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b052775d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b052775d&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75e2a9160ad9ff21aeeb5de59dfa7077b07c893","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Cleopatra%3A+A+Timewatch+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75e2a9160ad9ff21aeeb5de59dfa7077b07c893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,94,42,145,96,173,159,242,26,238,181,222,89,223,167,7,123,7,200,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
