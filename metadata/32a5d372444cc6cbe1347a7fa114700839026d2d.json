The  author then describes  some of  the contemporary\napplications of  mathematics --  in probability  theory, in  the study\nof  human behavior,  and  in combination  with  computers, which  give\nmathematics unprecedented power.\n\n\nThe author concludes with an insightful discussion of why mathematics,\nfor  most people,  is  so  frustrating. He  argues  that the  rigorous\nlogical structure  of math goes  against the grain of  our predisposed\nways of thinking as shaped by evolution, presumably because the talent\nneeded to cope with logical mathematics gave the human race as a whole\nno  evolutionary advantage.  With  this  in mind,  he  offers ways  to\novercome these innate impediments in the teaching of math.\n\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nZvi Artstein  is the  Hettie H. Heineman  Professor of  Mathematics at\nThe  Weizmann Institute  of  Science,  where he  has  worked for  over\nthirty-eight years as a scientist, a teacher, and an administrator. He\nis  the author  of  more  than 120  scientific  articles published  in\npeer-reviewed journals.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32a5d372444cc6cbe1347a7fa114700839026d2d","amp;dn":"Zvi+Artstein+-+Mathematics+and+the+Real+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32a5d372444cc6cbe1347a7fa114700839026d2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,165,211,114,68,76,198,203,225,52,122,127,161,20,112,8,57,2,109,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
