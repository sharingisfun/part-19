In addition, several recent disasters have highlighted the \nproblems and challenges associated with current disaster victim identification. \nDiscussing the latest advances and key research into identification from the \nface and skull, this book draws together a wide range of elements relating to \ncraniofacial analysis and identification. It examines all aspects of facial \nidentification, including the determination of facial appearance from the \nskull, comparison of the skull with the face and the verification of living \nfacial images. With sections covering the identification of the dead and of \nthe living, it provides a valuable review of the current state of play along \nwith the latest research advances in this constantly evolving field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345cc210a86e54461e07e3cff8c0f4289728cdf1","amp;dn":"Cambridge+University+Press+Craniofacial+Identifaction+2012+Retai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345cc210a86e54461e07e3cff8c0f4289728cdf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,92,194,16,168,110,84,70,30,7,227,207,248,192,244,40,151,40,205,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
