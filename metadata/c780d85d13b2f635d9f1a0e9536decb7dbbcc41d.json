Both charming and\nperfectly orchestrated, this debut blends lyrical charm and aesthetic\nglamour into fluffy mountains of candy-coated melody that will be sure\nto leave you in a sparkling mood. Ohhh... &quot;Of June&quot; makes us happy...\nvery happy indeed!&quot;\n\n\n\nOwl City offers perfect combinations of laid-back, relaxing\n&quot;feel-good&quot; music amidst the polite nod to the golden &quot;pre-adolescent&quot;\n1980&amp;#039;s days when New Wave ruled the music realm with bands like Human\nLeague, New Order, Howard Jones, Pet Shop Boys and Depeche Mode. &quot;Of\nJune&quot; is a charming, effervescent listen because it is, in a sense,\nfresh re-created New Wave perfectly designed and crafted to meet the\nneeds of our imaginations.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c780d85d13b2f635d9f1a0e9536decb7dbbcc41d","amp;dn":"Owl_City-Of_June-%28EP%29-2007-NAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c780d85d13b2f635d9f1a0e9536decb7dbbcc41d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,128,216,93,19,178,246,53,217,241,160,233,83,109,236,183,219,188,196,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
