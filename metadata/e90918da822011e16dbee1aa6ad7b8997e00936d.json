The Dutchman has recruited star names such as Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao with the aim of re-establishing United as a Premier League force. However, the side's defensive balance has come under the spotlight, and they face a real test against reigning champions Manchester City, who scored 102 league goals in the 2013/14 season, including four in an emphatic win against United at the Etihad Stadium. The day's second game sees Aston Villa entertain Tottenham Hotspur. This fixture has been one-sided in recent years - Spurs have won their last five games against Villa in all competitions, scoring 15 unanswered goals. However, Villa's solid start to the campaign will boost their hopes of ending that miserable run. There is also a look back at the goals from Saturday's matches","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e90918da822011e16dbee1aa6ad7b8997e00936d","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+-+2nd+November+2014+-+HDTV+X264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e90918da822011e16dbee1aa6ad7b8997e00936d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,9,24,218,130,32,17,225,109,190,225,170,106,215,184,153,126,0,147,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
