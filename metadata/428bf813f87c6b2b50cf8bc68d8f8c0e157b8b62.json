DANIEL DAVIS - MANUAL OF MAGNETISM (1842)  299 pages pdf\r\n\r\nA native of Princeton, New Jersey, Davis (1813-1887) was self-educated. \r\nDavis did not believe in patents. \r\nHad he patented some of his inventions he would have died a millionaire. \r\nHe invented the art of electrotyping in copper, wood-cuts and type such as are used to-day, \r\nand gave his inventions to the world. In 1846 he electrotyped in copper the arm of a child, \r\nwhich has been lately claimed as a new invention. \r\nIn 1840 Professor Gareaux of Paris arrived in Boston with the invention of Daguerre. \r\nDavis made a set of apparatus and probably took the first daguerrotype taken in this country. \r\nThis first picture taken in Boston was the German Catholic church on Suffolk street, \r\nnow Shawmut Avenue. Davis was also the first man in this country who did electro gold and silver plating, \r\nand taught the art. In 1844 Professor Morse had just introduced his telegraph, \r\nbut it was a very rude and impracticable machine. \r\nHe provided the crude machine to Davis for improvement and the result was the telegraph we remember. \r\nHe received several gold medals from various exhibitions for his inventions and skill as a manufacturer. \r\nHis shop became a gathering place for famous professors, scientists and electricians for many years. \r\nIt was frequented by Dr. Hare, Professors Webster, Hitchcock, Silliman, Henry, Abbott, \r\nFarmer and Channing and most of the other scientific minds of the time. \r\nAt that time probably no man in this country had such a thorough practical knowledge of electricity. \r\nHe will long be remembered through his published work on magnetism entitled &quot;A Manual of Magnetismâ€. \r\nThe first edition came out in 1842 and was published more to advertise his instruments, \r\nand as a means of calling attention to his business. \r\nThe accompanying catalogue contains a wealth of information on his many devices. \r\nThe work was used as a textbook by many colleges and high schools, \r\nand became a required text at the United States Military Academy at West Point. \r\nStudents made use of the many practical demonstrations shown within its pages. \r\nIn 1852 Davis retired back to his farm in Princeton.\r\n\r\n2.

GUSTAVE LeBON - THE EVOLUTION OF MATTER (1907)  478 pages pdf\r\n\r\n...Whenever frustration is met with arrogance both often give way to any expedient which seems to work. \r\nSuch strategies are never designed along visionary lines. \r\nThe accumulation of these actions, over the last several centuries, \r\nhas led us progressively into the ignorance of the inert worlds with their degenerated technologies. \r\nWe must and will persevere against these powers with patience and vision. \r\nWe must learn to wait for answers rather than implementing the vagaries of electrodynamics \r\nand thermodynamics as the power-elite would have us do. \r\nThese has been left us such a plethora of wonders, not only reported but real â€“ \r\nreal in every aspect and awaiting implementation. \r\nSuch an army of products would conquer the existing technology if sold at the grassroots level \r\nwithout benefit of patronship. Dr. Le Bon fought this fight all his life, \r\nand was at last utterly rejected by his associates. His name has been stricken from the record, \r\nhis books removed from all worthy libraries...\r\n\r\n4. MAURICE COTTERELL - HOW GRAVITY WORKS (and related matters) (2007)  24 pages pdf\r\n\r\nHis work, best described as â€˜adventure factâ€™ brings together modern science, \r\nspirituality and ancient wisdom to unlock the secrets of the past and the science of the future.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, he gave a lecture, in Nevada, USA, which explained how gravity â€˜mustâ€™ work. \r\nIt then took him 3 years to discover a causal mechanism \r\nthat reconciles physical phenomena with Newtonâ€™s equation for the force of gravity â€” \r\nand to find a way of explaining it.\r\n\r\nIn February 2010, the UK Institute of Engineering and Technology \r\naccepted How Gravity Works â€” and related matters for deposit in their Research Paper database. \r\nIt explains: How Electricity and Magnetism work-together to produce the force of Gravity; \r\nthe reasons why the atom is stable [why the protons in the nucleus do not spring apart; \r\nwhy the electrons are not sucked-into the positive nucleus; \r\nand why the neutron does not annihilate itself]; and, \r\nwhy the electron shells contain the numbers of electrons that they do","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:428bf813f87c6b2b50cf8bc68d8f8c0e157b8b62","amp;dn":"Magnetism%2C+Matter%2C+Gravity+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"428bf813f87c6b2b50cf8bc68d8f8c0e157b8b62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,139,248,19,248,124,107,43,80,207,139,198,141,143,140,14,21,123,139,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
