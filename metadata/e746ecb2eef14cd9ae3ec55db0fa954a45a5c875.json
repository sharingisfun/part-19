Their initial lineup also included keyboardist Robin Lumley and bassist Percy Jones (the Liverpool Scene, the Scaffold). Brand X\\'s debut album, Unorthodox Behaviour, was released in 1976; a live album, Livestock, and the studio effort Moroccan Roll followed in 1977. Collins left the group to concentrate on Genesis, and for 1978\\'s Masques, he was replaced by Al DiMeola drummer Chuck Burghi, as well as additional keyboardist Peter Robinson, who had played with Stanley Clarke. Three further albums -- 1979\\'s Product, 1980\\'s Do They Hurt?, and 1982\\'s Is There Anything About? -- followed before the group disbanded. In the mid-\\'90s, Lumley, Goodsall, and Jones reunited, issuing several live collections in the years to follow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e746ecb2eef14cd9ae3ec55db0fa954a45a5c875","amp;dn":"Brand+X+-+Product+-+1979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e746ecb2eef14cd9ae3ec55db0fa954a45a5c875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,70,236,178,238,241,76,217,174,62,197,93,176,250,149,74,69,165,200,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
