Unlike the recent rash of groups that feel content to only rework the gothier monumentalism of Joy Division and its many followers, though, Working for a Nuclear Free City take more overt cues from the dance side of the city's history -- not just Section 25 and A Certain Ratio, but the full-on industrial hysteria typified by the Hacienda. After a brief atmospheric introduction, the album kicks into mesmerizing full gear with &quot;Troubled Son,&quot; at once as thick and druggy as Happy Mondays at its most gone and as crisp and pulsing as early 808 State. On balance the album is a captivating revisioning of the dance/rock promise of the city's late-'80s sound if it followed a much different but parallel path to Oasis' rock-uber-alles approach -- in particular, the percussion is multifaceted and often dramatic in place of a stolid if powerful plod. The circular breakdown concluding &quot;Dead Fingers Talking&quot; and the quick, skittering full-on funk drumming on &quot;Innocence&quot; (an even better take on psych/funk than the Stone Roses' ultimate high point &quot;Begging You&quot;) in particular shows this utterly welcome approach. When they do work in a more straightforward rock mode, the results can be equally gripping -- the flow and charge of &quot;Over&quot; is just astonishing, the best reworking of early Spiritualized's sound since that band itself. For all that, straight-up atmospherics aren't forgotten either, with numerous short pieces softly breaking the album's flow, sometimes instrumental and sometimes, as with &quot;England,&quot; with a few quick vocal parts. &quot;Quiet Place,&quot; meanwhile, is a contextual surprise and a half, a sweet and serene combination of softly sung vocals and electronica/shoegaze that finds its own unique place.\n\n1.
