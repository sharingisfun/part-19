This original design has granted the building the nickname of &quot;La Paloma&quot; (&quot;The Dove&quot;). White concrete and glass have been used. The interiors are open and luminous spaces, distributed in two floors, the upper one for departures (check-in counters and gates) and the lower for arrivals.\nThe airport has seen a constant increase in its traffic numbers, the old terminal was already saturated and obsolete in 1990, although it had been renewed only a few years earlier. At the present day Bilbao is the most important hub in northern Spain and the number of passengers using the new terminal continues to rise, especially after the increased tourist interest in the city since the opening of the Guggenheim museum.\nAirline companies operating out of this airport:\nAer Lingus.\nAir Europa.\nAir Nostrum.\nAir Berlin.\nAir France.\nBrussels Airlines.\nEasyjet.\nIberia.\nIberworld.\nLufthansa.\nSAS.\nSpanair.\nTAP Air Portugal.\nVueling Airlines.\n \nFEATURES\nHighly detailed Bilbao Airport / LEBB\nPhotoscenery for the city of Bilbao with night lighting and full autogen (4m/pixel FS9 version\n3-Arc terrain mesh\nFull night illumination\nFS9 version compatible with default and add-on FS9 scenery\nCompatible with add-on mesh.\nCompatible with add-on landclass\nCompatible with add-on AI traffic\nUsage of FS9 SDK for the FS9 version for best performance\nAnimated traffic using custom models.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb6b5eb85feb406cbb51fa75b399ec7cf31ebedd","amp;dn":"FS2004%3A+Tropical+Sim+-+Bilbao+LEBB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb6b5eb85feb406cbb51fa75b399ec7cf31ebedd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,107,94,184,95,235,64,108,187,81,250,117,179,153,236,124,243,30,190,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
