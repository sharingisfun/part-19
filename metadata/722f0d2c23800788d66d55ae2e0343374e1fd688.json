At the gig, Scollay's enemy, the Greek, blackmails a man to come to the wedding reception and insult Maureen in front of the guests. Shortly after, Mike is shot down in a hail of gunfire from the Greek's men.\n\nMaureen takes over his business, making it into a large criminal empire, and getting revenge on the Greek, until she dies of a heart attack years later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:722f0d2c23800788d66d55ae2e0343374e1fd688","amp;dn":"Stephen+King-The+Wedding+Gig.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"722f0d2c23800788d66d55ae2e0343374e1fd688","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,47,13,44,35,128,7,136,214,109,85,174,46,3,67,55,78,31,214,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
