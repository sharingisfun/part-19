If you are looking for fun and history at the same time, these lectures are worth your time and investment--still worth the investment if you are just looking for great laughs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18)  Ernesto Che Guevara \nWalk down any high street in this country and chances are at some point you'll see somebody wearing a Che Guevara t shirt. Most of whom have absolutely no idea who he was and what he stood for. Still, it's a nice image, and he was handsome... Che Guevara was born in Argentina in 1928; initially he trained to be a doctor but became politically conscious and abandoned his vocation in order to travel across South America on the back of a motorbike. It was in Mexico in 1955 that Che met a young Fidel Castro who with his brother Raul had been exiled from his Cuban homeland and was preparing for an uprising there by training a crack squad of rebels in the Mexican countryside. This was Che's calling. It's what he'd been waiting his whole life for. It was his destiny. In this latest edition of his BAFTA nominated series of lectures, writer and broadcaster Mark Steel travels to South America and turns his attentions to the life and revolutionary times of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara, a man who started out on a motorcycle holiday, only to end up being made Foreign Minister of Cuba. Which of course is nice work if you can get it.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1537 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s MP3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 30mins\n * Number Of Parts: 18\n * Part Size: 349 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5872243e56cb88c1da3eaaefcc11029d63ea4bb","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Mark+Steel+Lectures+Series+1+to+3+18of18+Ernesto+Che+Gue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5872243e56cb88c1da3eaaefcc11029d63ea4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,135,34,67,229,108,184,140,29,163,234,174,252,193,16,41,214,62,164,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
