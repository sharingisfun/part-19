It was directed by Stephen Ives, the executive producer was Ken Burns and the narrator was Peter Coyote. The film originally aired on PBS in September 1996.\n\nStephen Ives and Ken Burns had worked together on several films, including The Civil War (1990) and Baseball (1994). In 1988, Ives created his own production company, Insignia Films, and began working on The West as director, with Burns signed on to the project as executive producer. In order to create The West, the film crew traveled over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) via airplane, conducted 72 interviews, visited 74 archives and collections, and filmed more than 250 hours of footage. The film's production was funded by General Motors.\n\nEpisode 6: Fight No More Forever (1874Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1877)\n\n\n\nAired, September 20th 1996; Narrator Peter Coyote\n\n\n\nEpisode Six chronicles the short and tragic period from 1874 through 1877, when the reality of a centralized federal power began to collide with the dream of a wild Western freedom. Regulators in Washington, possessed of formidable armies, cracked down harshly on the Lakota and Cheyenne in the Black Hills, the Nez Perce in modern-day Idaho and Oregon, and the Mormons in Utah -- all at a time when the country was celebrating 100 years of independence from British oppression. Specific topics include: Sitting Bull (Tatanka-Iyotanka) and his rallying of Native American forces, America's betrayal of the Fort Laramie Treaty, the daily life of an army soldier charged with patrolling and defending the West, the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the execution of John D. Lee, and the forced exile of Chief Joseph and his Nez Perce.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1391010b1004e06cb9a9368baefc537dbd006535","amp;dn":"PBS+Ken+Burns+The+West+6of9+Fight+No+More+Forever+1995+DVD+720p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1391010b1004e06cb9a9368baefc537dbd006535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,145,1,11,16,4,224,108,185,169,54,139,174,252,83,125,189,0,101,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
