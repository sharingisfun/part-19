Each chapter discusses theoretical aspects, applications to biological problems, and possible future developments. Topics and features: presents the use of thermodynamic models to analyze gene regulatory mechanisms; reviews major algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction; discusses developments in the area of oligo arrays; examines the application of models of stochastic processes in nonequilibrium thermodynamics and biological signal transduction; describes phylogenetic footprinting methods for TFBS identification; introduces penalized regression-based methods for constructing genetic interaction or regulatory networks; investigates the specific role played by irreversible Markov processes in modeling cellular biochemical systems; explores the concept of gene modules in a transcriptional regulatory network.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:776f1b78aa12fb2aab36313dccb99900bf8e691a","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Frontiers+in+Computational+and+Systems+Biology+%28Com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"776f1b78aa12fb2aab36313dccb99900bf8e691a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,111,27,120,170,18,251,42,171,54,49,61,204,185,153,0,191,142,105,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
