Lovecraft, who wrote of lost cities, tainted geneology, alien gods, and that fabled tome, The Necronomicon. The Thickets haven&amp;#039;t been able to get ahold of the ancient spellbook, but they&amp;#039;ve got their own brand of corruption. They&amp;#039;re on a Lovecraft binge of madness, and they mean to take you with them. The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets have a reputation for entrancing and inciting their live audiences with their melodic blend of energetic punk and rock, while wearing graphic costumes that help bring their good-naturedly macabre songs to life. Their latest project is the soundtrack to the much-anticipated film Spaceship Zero, based on the classic German TV show from the 1970s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f344b195d6f2a4f8c22869f2989109d20625e7","amp;dn":"The+darkest+of+the+hillside+thickets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f344b195d6f2a4f8c22869f2989109d20625e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,243,68,177,149,214,242,164,248,194,40,105,242,152,145,9,210,6,37,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
