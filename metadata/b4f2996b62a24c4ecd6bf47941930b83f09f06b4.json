Who would believe that girl to be such an amazing artist enjoying worldwide success and fame year by year! Her voice is breathtaking and her songs are meaningful. She keeps gettin&amp;#039; better! That song gives us a little taste to what we&amp;#039;re gonna hear in the next album which is scheduled to be out on summer 2009. We love Christina because she&amp;#039;s a true and unique artist who always comes up with something new and never sticks to the good old hit formula. Thanks Christina for the decade of hits and pleasant music.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4f2996b62a24c4ecd6bf47941930b83f09f06b4","amp;dn":"Christina+Aguilera+-+Keeps+Gettin%5C%27+Better%3A+A+Decade+Of+Hits+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4f2996b62a24c4ecd6bf47941930b83f09f06b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,242,153,107,98,162,76,78,205,107,244,121,65,147,11,131,240,159,6,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
