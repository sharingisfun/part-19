Here Nigella Lawson serves up 120 straightforward and mouthwatering recipes that are quick and easy yet elevate weeknight meals into no-fuss feasts.\nWith beautiful color photographs to inspire, Nigellissima has all the hallmarks of traditional Italian fare in its faithfulness to the freshest ingredients and simplest methods.  From pasta and meat to fish, vegetables, and, of course, dolci, this cookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tour has something for every mood, season, and occasion: Curly-Edged Pasta with Lamb Ragu is the perfect salve for a winterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s night, while tangy and light Spaghettini with Lemon and Garlic Breadcrumbs takes just minutes to prepare. Meatzza, the favorite at NigellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s table, is a meatball mixture pressed into a pan and finished with traditional Margherita ingredientsÃ¢â‚¬â€or whatever you may have on hand. And the versatile Baby Eggplant with Oregano and Red Onion works beautifully as a starter or side or as dinner sprinkled with ricotta salata or crumbled feta. Here, too, are Green Beans with Pistachio Pesto, Roast Butternut with Sage and Pine Nuts, and fluffy Mascarpone Mash, NigellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twist on mashed potatoes.  Never an afterthought, NigellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s low-maintenance Ã¢â‚¬Å“sweet thingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ include Instant Chocolate-Orange Mousse; light, doughnut-like Sambuca Kisses; and One-Step No-Churn Coffee Ice Cream, to name just a few.\nNigella believes that every ingredient must earn its place in a recipe, and she gives tips and techniques for making the most of your time in the kitchen. For example, a stash of sweet vermouth saves you from opening a bottle when you need just a splash. If a recipe calls for the juice of a lemon, Nigella uses the zest, tooÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where its force and fragrance lie. She guides you to stocking your pantry with a few supermarket ingredients and shows you how to make the most of them for spontaneous meals that taste boldly Italian.\nNigellissima is a love letter to the pleasures of cookingÃ¢â‚¬â€and eatingÃ¢â‚¬â€the way Italians do. With a nod to the traditional but in NigellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark style, here are recipes that excite the imagination without stressing the cook.\n\nCONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION\nPASTA\nMEAT, FISH &amp; FOWL\nVEGETABLES &amp; SIDES\nSWEET THINGS\nAN ITALIAN-INSPIRED CHRISTMAS\nNOTES\nINDEX\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:193aa12c3d859f477a2d1cd264d608b99e38136d","amp;dn":"Nigellissima+-+Easy+Italian-Inspired+Recipes+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"193aa12c3d859f477a2d1cd264d608b99e38136d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,58,161,44,61,133,159,71,122,45,28,210,100,214,8,185,158,56,19,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
