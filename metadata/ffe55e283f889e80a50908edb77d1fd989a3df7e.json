Some believe that &quot;New Wave&quot; of Persian cinema emerged after this film.\n\nThe story begins by showcasing the close relationship between a middle-aged Iranian villager Masht Hasan and his beloved cow. Hassan is married but has no child. His only valuable property is a cow that he cherishes - the only cow in the village.\n\nWhen Hasan must leave the village for a short time, the pregnant cow is found dead in the barn. Hasan's fellow villagers fear his reaction &amp; cover up the evidence of the death and tell him upon his return that his cow has run away. Finding great difficulty confronting the loss of his beloved cow, as well the loss of livestock that affects his social stature at the village, Hasan gradually goes insane following a nervous breakdown and believes he is the cow, adopting such mannerisms as eating hay. His wife &amp; the villagers try their best to bring him back to the normal life but all in vain. The tragedy ends with Hasan's death.\n\n---=Rip Info=------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\tVideo: 599 MB (85.84%)\n\tAudio: 87.4 MB (12.51%)\n\tAVI Overhead: 11.4 MB (1.64%)\n\t\n\t---=Audio=-------------------------------------\n\t0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n\t48000Hz  105 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo LAME3.97 \n\tInterleave: 1 vid frame (33 ms), preload=504\n\t\n\t---=Video=-------------------------------------\n\t512 x 384 @ 29.970 fps, XviD\n\t1:56:32, 209,541 frames\n\tQf 0.122/719 kbps\n\n\t---=Size=--------------------------------------\n\t732,469,248 bytes (209,541 frames)\n\n\t---=Subtitles=---------------------------------\n\tEnglish hardsubs\n\t\t\n\t---=Credits=-----------------------------------\n\tThanks to Tansir and friends at DVD World\n\tRip by -=:ZEiNAB:=-\n\t\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
