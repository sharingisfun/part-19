The story begins as he is brought into the titular &quot;deathroom&quot; as he realizes that his captors, after interrogating him about a Communist insurgency he has been supporting, due to the government's killing of a group of nuns which included his sister, will not let him leave this room alive, despite their claims that he will be set free.\n\nDuring the course of his interrogation, Fletcher manages to keep calm, and hatches a desperate plan to save his life, which, to his surprise, actually works. He fakes an epileptic seizure, and in the captors struggle to save him he steals a gun. After killing three of his captors and maiming one, he escapes &quot;the deathroom.&quot; Fletcher, having no way of knowing if the gunfire was heard, starts up the stairs to see if he can escape.\n\nThe story ends with a man, almost certainly Fletcher, buying a pack of cigarettes at a newsstand kiosk in New York.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae897a6e8d07fdfeef52c4ce2e56f4cbd1e3d666","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+In+The+Deathroom.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae897a6e8d07fdfeef52c4ce2e56f4cbd1e3d666","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,137,122,110,141,7,253,254,239,82,196,206,46,86,244,203,209,227,214,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
