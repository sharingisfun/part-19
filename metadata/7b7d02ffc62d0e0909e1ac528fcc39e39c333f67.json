The performance of &quot;My Wife&quot; was from a concert The Who filmed for The Kids Are Alright at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn; however the footage was not used in the film. That show was later restored for DVD and released as The Who At Kilburn: 1977 in 2008. &quot;Tommy Can You Hear Me&quot; had a longer outro with Roger Daltrey repeating the word &quot;Tommy&quot; before Keith Moon screams &quot;'Ello!&quot; to end the song. The soundtrack album did well in the US and peaked at #8 on the Billboard album chart and went platinum whilst it peaked at a disappointing #26 on the UK charts.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kids_Are_Alright_%28soundtrack%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kids_Are_Alright_%28soundtrack%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7d02ffc62d0e0909e1ac528fcc39e39c333f67","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+The+Kids+Are+Alright+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7d02ffc62d0e0909e1ac528fcc39e39c333f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,125,2,255,198,45,14,9,9,225,172,82,143,204,57,227,156,51,63,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
