Elvis's fellow soldier and friend, Rex Mansfield, along with his wife, Elisabeth-with whom Elvis was once romantically linked-reveal a fascinating portrait of young Elvis the soldier. Tales of Elvis and Rex's induction in Memphis, basic training in Texas, and travels to Germany are recounted, and stories of the genesis of Elvis's addiction to prescription drugs, his initial meeting with Priscilla Beaulieu, and his daily life on base and in the homes he rented in Texas and Germany are revealed. Included are many previously unpublished photographs from this important time in Elvis's life.\n\nAbout the Author\nRex Mansfield and Elisabeth Mansfield live in Tennessee. Marshall Terrill is the author of Steve McQueen: Portrait of an American Rebel and Flight of the Hawk: The Aaron Pryor Story.
