Born in Brussels and trained by his grandmother, he was called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Velvet BrueghelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for his skill at painting rich and delicate textures.\nThis monograph takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of BrueghelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fascinating paradise landscape, exploring Renaissance zoology, religious views on nature, and the culture of collecting and cataloguing animals and natural specimens. It is brilliantly illustrated with paintings of landscapes and animals by artists such as Albrecht DÃƒÂ¼rer, Peter Paul Rubens, and Lucas Cranach the Elder as well as by Brueghel himself. It presents an overview of the tradition of this type of painting and discusses both the cultural context and the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s background, crucial to understanding BrueghelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach to nature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b18ccfb147becf697ef4cfdb9bbacb4ad258b87b","amp;dn":"Jan+Brueghel+the+Elder+-+The+Entry+of+the+Animals+into+Noahs+Ark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b18ccfb147becf697ef4cfdb9bbacb4ad258b87b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,140,207,177,71,190,207,105,126,244,207,219,155,186,203,74,210,88,184,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
