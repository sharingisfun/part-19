The program supports 24bit-192 khz recording, multiple channels soundcards, live input processing, mp3 encoding and much more.\nFeatures:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Audio in all popular WAV file formats except 8-bit, as well as Ogg Vorbis\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ MIDI (with piano-roll editor)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DX/DXi/VST/VSTi plugins\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Cut-paste editing\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ ASIO, WDM, and MME audio interfaces\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Robust set of built-in effects (compressor, MB-compressor, parametric EQ, reverb, auto-vol, pitch shift, echo, chorus, and tempo delay)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Spectrum analyzer\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ LIVE mode for hearing FX while recording\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Multiple soundcards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Surround mixing\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Automation of volume, pan, aux sends &amp; returns, and plugin FX parameters\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ ReWire technology by Propellerhead\n\nxoxoxox\nx FaQ x\nxoxoxox\n\nQ: 'I download this movie/video, but there's only picture in it, no sounds. Why??'\nA: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; \n   \n   OPTION 1: Download &amp; install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n   OPTION 2: Download &amp; install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded\n\nQ: 'I download a keygen from a user &amp; my AV flagged it as a virus!'\nA: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. \n\n   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.\n   \n   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user &amp; check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. \n\n   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.\n   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.\n\n   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum &amp; report it here: \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt; ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    \n\nQ: 'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?'\nA: Most probably you're banned. Don't worry, drop by to the forum &amp; explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772\n\nQ: 'I registered an account on TPB, but i don't receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?'\nA: It might be the mail servers are down. Come to the forum, and post it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=50701\n\nQ: 'I don't know how to mount an image file.
