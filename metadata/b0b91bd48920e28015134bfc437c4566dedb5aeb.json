It offers a comprehensive range of principles, methods, techniques and tools to provide the reader with a clear knowledge of the current academic and industry practice and debate that define the field.\n\nPhysical, cognitive, social and emotional aspects are considered throughout and the text is illustrated by key application domains such as aviation, automotive, medicine and defence. Above all, this volume is designed as a research guide that will both inform readers on the basics of human-machine interaction from academic and industrial perspectives and also provide a view ahead at the means through which cognitive engineers and human factors specialists will attempt to design and develop human-machine systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b91bd48920e28015134bfc437c4566dedb5aeb","amp;dn":"The+Handbook+Of+Human-Machine+Interaction%3A+A+Human-Centered+Desi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b91bd48920e28015134bfc437c4566dedb5aeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,185,27,212,137,32,226,128,21,19,75,252,67,124,69,102,222,219,90,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
