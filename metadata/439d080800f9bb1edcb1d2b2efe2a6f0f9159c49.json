It is also the setting for a tangled web of politics, personal ambition, love, jealousy, and murder.Telescopes on Earth have detected an Earth-sized planet circling a star some thirty light-years away. Now the race is on to get pictures of that distant world, photographs and spectra that will show whether or not the planet is truly like Earth, and if it bears life.\n\nFarside will include the largest optical telescope in the solar system as well as a vast array of radio antennas, the most sensitive radio telescope possible, insulated from the interference of EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s radio chatter by a thousand kilometers of the MoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solid body.\n\nBuilding the Farside observatory is a complex, often dangerous task. On the airless surface of the Moon, under constant bombardment of hard radiation and infalling micrometeoroids, builders must work in cumbersome spacesuits and use robotic machines as much as possible. BreakdownsÃ¢â‚¬â€mechanical and emotionalÃ¢â‚¬â€are commonplace. Accidents happen, some of them fatal.\n\nWhat they find stuns everyone, and the human race will never be the same.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“BovaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest novel is one of his best, and a classic use of the old sf theme of humanity reaching out for immortality among the stars.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Booklist (starred review) on Farside","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:439d080800f9bb1edcb1d2b2efe2a6f0f9159c49","amp;dn":"Farside+by+Ben+Bova+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"439d080800f9bb1edcb1d2b2efe2a6f0f9159c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,157,8,8,0,249,187,30,220,177,210,178,239,226,166,240,249,21,156,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
