It was also the first Hollies album to feature only one song written or co-written by lead guitarist Tony Hicks, a member of the band's two in-house songwriting teams, Clarke-Hicks-Nash and Clarke-Hicks-Sylvester. Hicks was the only member of those teams to contribute a song to the album; Rickfors was the only other band member to contribute an original composition to it. The U.S. Epic version which reached #84 on the Billboard 200, omitted the track &quot;Lizzy and the Rainman&quot;, and has a slightly altered side one track order. &quot;Courage of Your Convictions&quot; was the one song that sounded most like their previous smash hit &quot;Long Cool Woman In A Black Dress&quot;, but was inexplicably never issued as a single. The cover of Romany shows exactly the same scene as the previous album, but in the winter time as opposed to the summer scene on Distant Light.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59150937034ac10bee10387c881b338a5f42e55e","amp;dn":"The+Hollies+-+Romany+%282013%29+Japan+Mini+LP+SHM-CD+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59150937034ac10bee10387c881b338a5f42e55e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,21,9,55,3,74,193,11,238,16,56,124,136,27,51,138,95,66,229,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
