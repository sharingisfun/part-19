Exclusive items and incentives for fans range from special art created by Kand's daughter Zara to having the band play your funeral. (Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be on standby until your demiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ says the band on their PledgeMusic project page at Where ever it is.\n\nIn Kand's mind, funding the upcoming album through PledgeMusic - and thus not working with a record label - allows Christian Death a level of freedom they haven't enjoyed in some time.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“You don't have to deal with other people doing it this way,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“With labels, you're talking about their money; you're talking about they way they do things as opposed to, 'Let's just do this and that's all there is to it.' Another reason it's not worth dealing with record companies is that they don't have any money because people really don't buy CDs and vinyl anymore. That was their mainstay, so now the cash flow isn't there to really fund projects and put bands on the road to do good shows.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If this is right the War of attrition just got a boost.\n\n\n \tChristian Death\n2015 \tThe Root Of All Evilution\nMetal Rock Folk rock Gothic rock Dark folk Death rock Folk metal\n\nCD Album\nStandard Edition\n\n    In the Garden of Evilution\n    This Cross\n    Tar Black Liquid\n    Fema Coffins\n    Illuminazi\n    We Have Become\n    Forgiven\n    Penitence Forevermore\n    Deliver Us\n    Secrets Down Below\n\n\nSo if you read this: They dumped the machine and are independently releasing this album.  \nThey went totally independent and have neither the backing or money from a label. So I must insist that the band be considered above all. \nGo to the webpage im sure they have one,  If you like it, buy it from the artist. \nIt is a test of p2p for this to work. If artists can dump machine and get the promotion from the web and torrent sites It would do an end run around DMCA and the Recording trolls. \nPie in the sky probably. The War of attrition is the great hope","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ee64cf4878238234e3e8fc17ca909b14ddb201","amp;dn":"Christian+Death+-+The+Root+Of+All+Evilution+%282015%29ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ee64cf4878238234e3e8fc17ca909b14ddb201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,238,100,207,72,120,35,130,52,227,232,252,23,202,144,155,20,221,178,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
