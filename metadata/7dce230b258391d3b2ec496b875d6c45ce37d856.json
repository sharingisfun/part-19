The birds are illustrated in a series of 74 stunning full-colour plates, painted for this book by Alan Pearson, an artist with considerable first-hand experience of the region. The plates illustrate the various plumage variations for each bird, and show the birds perched and also in flight, where relevant to their identification. The text, written and revised by Allen Jeyarajasingam, is accessible to experienced ornithologists and beginners alike, and highlights the important identification features such as plumage variations, size, calls and songs, range, distribution, and status for every species. Introductory sections describe the region and highlight some of the best sites for watching the abundant avifauna. \r\n\r\nThe beautiful, precise plates and clearly-written text make this book a must-have for all birdwatchers travelling to the region","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dce230b258391d3b2ec496b875d6c45ce37d856","amp;dn":"A+Field+Guide+to+the+Birds+of+Peninsular+Malaysia+and+Singapore+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dce230b258391d3b2ec496b875d6c45ce37d856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,206,35,11,37,131,145,211,178,236,73,107,135,93,108,69,206,55,216,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
