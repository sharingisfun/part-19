Fumbling Towards Ecstasy  9:47\n\n   \n   &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; marks the transition from Sarah McLachlan, sort of geeky, post-new wave, quasi-new age Canadian singer-songwriter, to Sarah McLachlan, she of the ethereal voice and infectious introspectiveness, a kind of adult-alternative currency traded between college girls and their midde-aged dads, the woman who would be Lilith. Some geekiness prevails (&quot;Mary&quot;, for example, has an adult-contemperary corniness about it), albeit mostly of the wholesome, Canadian variety. But the lady sure does know a thing or two about breathtaking beauty, and &quot;Ice&quot; and &quot;Fear&quot; prove it.\n-Rachel Devitt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c03bd3126b5b91152b7e4676d14e4d772d47ef8","amp;dn":"Sarah+McLachlan+-+Fumbling+Towards+Ecstasy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c03bd3126b5b91152b7e4676d14e4d772d47ef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,3,189,49,38,181,185,17,82,183,228,103,109,20,228,215,114,212,126,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
