This class introduces students to the basics of Artificial Intelligence, which includes machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, robotics, and natural language processing.\n\nThe objective of this class is to teach you modern AI. You learn about the basic techniques and tricks of the trade, at the same level we teach our Stanford students. We also aspire to excite you about the field of AI. Whether you are a seasoned professional, a college student, or a curious high school student - everyone can participate.\n\nThis online class will make this material available to a worldwide audience. But rather than just watching lectures online, you will participate. You will do homework assignments, take exams, participate in discussions with other students, ask questions of the instructors, and also get a final score.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28829dfc5bdf11f4f43b125196b5b36d9a9f9bea","amp;dn":"Online+Introduction+to+Artificial+Intelligence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28829dfc5bdf11f4f43b125196b5b36d9a9f9bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,130,157,252,91,223,17,244,244,59,18,81,150,181,179,109,154,159,155,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
