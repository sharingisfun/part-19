The focal point is the Russian revolution of 1905, when the political mobilization of the Jewish youth took on massive proportions, producing a cohort of radicalized activists - committed to socialism, nationalism, or both - who would exert an extraordinary influence on Jewish history in the twentieth-century in Eastern Europe, the United States, and Palestine. Frankel describes the dynamics of 1905 and the leading role of the intelligentsia as revolutionaries, ideologues, and observers. But, elsewhere, he also looks backwards to the emergent stage of modern Jewish politics in both Russia and the West and forward to the part played by the veterans of 1905 in Palestine and the United States","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11a8a113746040147b48993eac36e88f01f0daab","amp;dn":"Crisis%2C+Revolution%2C+and+Russian+Jews","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11a8a113746040147b48993eac36e88f01f0daab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,168,161,19,116,96,64,20,123,72,153,62,172,54,232,143,1,240,218,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
