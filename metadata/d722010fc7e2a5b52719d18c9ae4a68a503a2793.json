The young JR manipulates his meagre economic beginnings including a shipment of Navy surplus picnic forks, a defaulted bond issue and turns them into a massive paper empire. The novel's satiric assault upon the American Dream, and the economics it represents makes a compulsive read and the seminal American novel.\n\n\nUnabridged, 64 kbps, mp3.\n\n\nIf you like this audio book, you should also buy it.
