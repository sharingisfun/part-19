Kicking things off with &quot;Dancing With Mr. D.,&quot; ... Full Descriptionthe Stones picked up the thread of &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; and gilded their already hedonistic reputation with some Satanic allusions. References to Beezelbub aside, SOUP offered up some of the Stones' more heartfelt ballads including &quot;Winter,&quot; &quot;Coming Down Again,&quot; and the lilting, minor-key classic &quot;Angie.&quot;\n\nOf course, being known as &quot;The World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band&quot; means a number of songs more than back up this moniker. Among them are &quot;Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),&quot; propelled by Mick Taylor's wah-wah pedal and Billy Preston's electric piano, and the twang and slide guitar of &quot;Silver Train.&quot; There's an abundance of cheeky attitude here despite a slew of slow songs, and the Stones close out with a nasty, backhanded tribute to groupies called &quot;Star Star.&quot; Though GOAT'S HEAD SOUP does not hold up to the four studio masterpieces that preceded it (BEGGAR'S BANQUET, LET IT BLEED, STICKY FINGERS, and EXILE ON MAIN STREET), it is still full of strong songwriting, great playing, and plenty of classic Stonesy swagger.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
