Please seed.\n\nThe Klezmer Fiddler - Jewish music of celebration\nSheet music for violin and guitar\n\nKlezmer is the traditional instrumental music of the Jewish people of Eastern Europe. A music with universal appeal and power to communicate, it reflects the spirit of Judaism - and in particular the celebration of its weddings. Purists tend not to like the word 'klezmer' on the grounds that it has more to do with recent revivals of the music than with its origins in the Ukraine, Galitsia and Romania. But for the rest of us the word has its own resonance and magic, calling to mind an exciting musical world full of emotional intensity and vitality.\n\nThe arrangements in this collection can be performed as solos, duets, trios or by larger ensembles. You can go ultra-authentic (simply use the melody and the violin accompaniment found in the complete edition) or recreate the sound of current klezmer revival bands by adding bass guitar and percussion. Either way, remember that the musical notation is appropriate - rhythms can be pulled and squeezed, pitches dip and dive, and melodies can be showered in a confetti of ornamentation.\n\nContents\n- Bulgar from Odessa (Odessa Bulgar)\n- At the Rabbi's Feast (Baym rebns sude)\n- Freylechs from Bukovina (Bukoviner freylekhs)\n- Freylechs from Warsaw (Varshaver freylekhs)\n- Leading the In-Laws Home (Firn di mekhutonim aheym)\n- In-laws' Dance (Mekhutonim tants)\n- Sweet Father (Tate ziser)\n- Dance of Displeasure (Broyges tants)\n- Bulgar from Kishinev (Kishinever bulgar)\n- Dance of Delight (Freylekh tants)\n- Doina (Doyna)\n- Street Melody (Der gasn nign)\n- The Wise Man's Song (Dem tzadiks zemerl)\n- Little Galitsian Dance (Galitsianer tentsl)\n- Jewish Wedding Song (Khosn kale mazl tov)\n- Dance!
