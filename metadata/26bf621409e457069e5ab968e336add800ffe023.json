This handbook will enable the Bible believer to handle problems which may arise from those who resent, disbelieve, ignore, or ridicule the Authorized Version. The problems of sources are defined and analyzed, the evidence from the church fathers and ancient versions is discussed, and the argument by the critics on the &quot;archaic words&quot; in the Authorized Version is answered. The variances between the Greek Textus Receptus and the AV are examined, and the newer versions are compared with the King James and are found to be deficient. In this work, Dr. Ruckman demonstrates the Roman Catholic bias of Westcott and Hort and dissects their theories of textual criticism. Proof is presented for the superiority of the AV over the &quot;original Greek.&quot;\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy scriptures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26bf621409e457069e5ab968e336add800ffe023","amp;dn":"+Christian%27s+Handbook+of+Manuscript+Evidence+-+Peter+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26bf621409e457069e5ab968e336add800ffe023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,191,98,20,9,228,87,6,158,90,185,104,227,54,173,216,0,255,224,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
