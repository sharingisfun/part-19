Alice lives in slavery to duty and machines: yet she's content, supported by the love of her minder, Dr. DeVeaux. Marika. \nThen the program is shut down, and Alice is forced to return to normal human functionality. \n\nLoss of purpose...loss of time...loss of her machines.\n\nAnd the revulsion of her beloved Marika, at Alice's loss of helplessness.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b634207e98b9880204aa8931f8dbdd590f961448","amp;dn":"FF+Jennifer+Pelland+-+Captive+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b634207e98b9880204aa8931f8dbdd590f961448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,52,32,126,152,185,136,2,4,170,137,49,248,219,221,89,15,150,20,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
