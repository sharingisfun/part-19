Fiftyfive years after the fact the world still ponders the enormity of this disaster.

The book also has more than 250 photographs, many of them rare, and 19 maps. The volume includes: Raul Hilberg on concentration camps and Gypsies; Ruth Bondy, Israel Gutman, and Dina Porat on major ghettoes; Roger Greenspun on the Holocaust in cinema and television; Richard Breitman on American policy; Michael Berenbaum on theological and philosophical responses; Saul Friedlander on Nazi policy; Michael Hagemeister on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion; Michael R.
