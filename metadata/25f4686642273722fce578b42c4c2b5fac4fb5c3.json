The program will automatically cut what\\'s outside the channel.\n\n\nTake your favorite pictures and convert them into original icons easily with this icon editor. Image Icon Converter helps you edit digital images into icons, and also does the reverse, transferring icons into digital images. A step-by-step wizard walks you through the process. You can create icons as small as 16x16 pixels or as large as 128x128 pixels, with color depth ranging from 16 bit to 32 bit. The program supports a wide range of file formats, including BMP, JPEG, GIF, PNG, TGA, TIFF, and PCX, and also can use screenshot images. An image editor contains most of the basic functions, such as rotate, crop and flip, as well as basic image effects such as color balance, brightness, contrast, sharpen, and soften. Some drawbacks include the program\\'s inability to support batch conversions. While the Offical Web Site: interface is functional, it isn\\'t the most aesthetically pleasing. Overall, this basic program is a solid bet for beginner icon designers.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPowerPC or Intel Mac\nMac OS X Leopard 10.5\n\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ----","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25f4686642273722fce578b42c4c2b5fac4fb5c3","amp;dn":"Image+to+Icons+1.2.2+%2B+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25f4686642273722fce578b42c4c2b5fac4fb5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,244,104,102,66,39,55,34,252,229,120,180,44,76,43,95,172,79,181,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
