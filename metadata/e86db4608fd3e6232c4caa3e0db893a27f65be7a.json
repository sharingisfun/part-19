It features Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders as soloists, both playing tenor saxophones. Much of the recording is fairly avant-garde, featuring extensive passages in free rhythm and extended saxophone techniques such as honked and overblown notes, as well as multiphonics. This would be the last Coltrane recording with long-time partners drummer Elvin Jones and pianist McCoy Tyner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e86db4608fd3e6232c4caa3e0db893a27f65be7a","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Meditations+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e86db4608fd3e6232c4caa3e0db893a27f65be7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,109,180,96,143,211,230,35,44,76,170,62,13,184,147,162,127,101,190,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
