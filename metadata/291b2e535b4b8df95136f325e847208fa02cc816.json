The other tests have the answers in the correct order but many are off by 2 questions as the essays are not included (i.e. answer #112 may correspond to question #114).\n\n\nPersonal recommendation: The Berkeley Review books for chem and physics are the most comprehensive and I would TBR primarily for those subjects.  The EK biology book is excellent and was in my opinion the most efficient way to study for the biology section.\n\n\nThe MCAT practice tests are only useful the first run through each one, so make sure you're ready to start writing tests before you use them!\n\n\nGood luck!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:291b2e535b4b8df95136f325e847208fa02cc816","amp;dn":"MCAT+Variety+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"291b2e535b4b8df95136f325e847208fa02cc816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,27,46,83,91,75,141,249,81,54,243,37,232,71,32,143,160,44,200,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
