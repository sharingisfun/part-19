The album was recorded on first meeting which gives it that fresh spontaneous feel. I'd never heard of anyone else doing this, it made it very challenging and put pressure on which was good. I remember Vincent Crane helping me out on several occasions giving me a note without me even asking for tuning purposes, he was brilliant. If I play the album which I do on very infrequent occasions I get a good vibe from Who's That Knockin' and the Boogie track. The Case I remember was us all jamming and Jeff came in saying stop I've lost my case, we carried on playing and he grabbed a mike and started rapping it, if you listen to it I think he's threatening legal action. Peter wanted the group to stay together but everyone went their seperate ways. I could go on and on as I went on to play with Peter for some time after that rehearsing at Ginger Baker's studio in Acton.
