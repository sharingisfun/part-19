These are two awesome old animated movies, Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000. Good luck, and I hope you all help me seed because I am trying to pump as many unique/cool DVDRips on this site as fast as I can, which leaves me having to jump off my torrents after a week or so. I am begging, because I want to push as much cool shit out as I can, and who doesn&amp;#039;t like cool-ass DVD copies?\nNext ones shuld be a few cool-ass, rare Bakshi films, just by the by.\n\nBy the by, here&amp;#039;s a nice graphical list of all my DVDs. If I get any requests I think are good, or if enough people ask for something, I&amp;#039;ll torrent it. So hey, post away! http://bradp.co.uk/fredryk/dvds/ I usually go for the shit that is kinda obscure and that I think people would love, though, so you know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93e594eab8f567aeb8790097d6d8f8992f97235f","amp;dn":"Heavy+Metal+and+Heavy+Metal+2000+DVDRips-+Awesome+old+animation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93e594eab8f567aeb8790097d6d8f8992f97235f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,229,148,234,184,245,103,174,184,121,0,151,214,216,248,153,47,151,35,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
