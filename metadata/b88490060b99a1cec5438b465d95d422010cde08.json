Forensic Approaches to Buried Remains takes an innovative approach to the subject by placing the role of the forensic archaeologist within the wider forensic environment; it identifies new areas of interdisciplinary research and practice, and evaluates practical difficulties.\n\nThe authors see this book as a reflection of the subjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development, and as a knowledge base for the next generation of forensic archaeologists. Areas covered include:\n-    Search logistics, integration and specialist search scenarios\n-    Levels of confidence in site search and elimination\n-    Urban and rural landscape reconstruction in both short and long term cases\n-    The integration of cadaver dogs and earth-moving machinery\n-    The recovery of multiple evidence types\n-    Sampling strategies, spatial relevance and dating\n-    Multiple burial scenarios\n\nAs part of the Essential Forensic Science book series this book will provide students and practitioners alike with an invaluable resource outlining both the major developments in the discipline, as well as original approaches to the search for, and recovery of buried remains.\n\nAbout the Authors\nJohn Hunter MFL (Manlove Forensics Limited), Wantage, Oxfordshire, UK and University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK\nBarrie Simpson MFL (Manlove Forensics Limited), Wantage, Oxfordshire, UK\nCaroline Sturdy Colls MFL (Manlove Forensics Limited), Wantage, Oxfordshire, UK and Staffordshire University, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, UK\n\nContents\nList of figures vii\nSeries foreword xi\nPreface and acknowledgements xiii\nThe authors xv\nAbout the companion website xvii\n1 An introduction to buried remains 1\n2 Search theory and the landscape 23\n3 Search application 49\n4 Search design 77\n5 Longer-term Ã¢â‚¬Ëœno bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cases 101\n6 Recovery, stratigraphy and destruction 137\n7 Recovery, sampling and dating 181\n8 The investigation of multiple burials 213\nBibliography 233\nIndex 251\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b88490060b99a1cec5438b465d95d422010cde08","amp;dn":"Forensic+Approaches+to+Buried+Remains+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b88490060b99a1cec5438b465d95d422010cde08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,132,144,6,11,153,161,206,197,67,139,70,93,149,212,34,1,12,222,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
