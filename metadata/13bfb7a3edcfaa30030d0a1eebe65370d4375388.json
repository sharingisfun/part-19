They have been known for their sense of loyalty, compassion and most of all their ability to be trained more than any other popular pet. Dogs can be taught a myriad of tricks and behaviors ranging from very basic ones like sitting, begging and going outside to do their business to extremely complex tricks like acrobatics and scent recognition.\r\n\r\nEvery dog is different so training is never a guaranteed experience but just about any canine can be trained if you have the will and the desire. In this book Iâ€™m going to explore the most basic training methods that can be used on all or most dogs, usually without fail. Iâ€™m going to emphasis positive reinforcement training as\r\nit is not only effective but much safer than alternative methods that have been used throughout the years. Due to the short nature of this book we will probably not venture into theatrical tricks or acrobatics; itâ€™s always smart to start with a good foundation and that begins with obedience training.\r\n\r\nObedience training is a general term which can be achieved through the many various dog training techniques. Regardless of which training technique you choose to employ , your techniques should build or strengthen a healthy and appropriate relationship between you and your dog.\r\n\r\nTraining opens up a clear line of communication between you and your dog. This includes you knowing what to expect of your dog in all circumstances, and your dog understanding and respecting what is expected of him/her.  Dog Training for Obedience lays down a set of rules or boundaries which educates your dog to become a responsible member of society. Including how to relate to other dogs, animals and people, basic manners and how to behave in any situation. Lastly it establishes the groundwork which assists in preventing the development of unacceptable problem behavior - such as jumping up, barking, chewing, digging etc.\r\ntags:\r\ndog barking \r\ndog kennels \r\ndog crates \r\ndog collars \r\nrescue dogs \r\ndog doors \r\ndoggy day care \r\ngerman shepherd dog \r\ndog whisperer \r\ndog toys \r\npuppy training \r\ndog show \r\ndog boarding \r\nhow to train a puppy \r\ndog coats \r\ndog leash \r\nbarking dog \r\ndog daycare \r\ndog walking \r\nhow to potty train a puppy \r\nguard dogs \r\nhow to train a dog \r\ncrate training \r\ndog shock collar \r\ndog training collars \r\ntoy dogs \r\ncrate training puppy \r\npet dogs \r\npotty training puppy \r\nclicker training","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13bfb7a3edcfaa30030d0a1eebe65370d4375388","amp;dn":"Dog+Obedience+Training+Guide.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13bfb7a3edcfaa30030d0a1eebe65370d4375388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,191,183,163,237,207,170,48,3,13,10,30,235,230,83,112,212,55,83,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
