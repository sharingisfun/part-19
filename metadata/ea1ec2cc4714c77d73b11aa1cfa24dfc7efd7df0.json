Captured during a prolific spurt of recording activity at Chess Studios in Chicago that June, Five By Five was released that August in the UK shortly after their debut album, The Rolling Stones, had appeared. The title of Five by Five is a play on wordsÃ¢â‚¬â€five tracks recorded by the five members of the band.[citation needed]\n\nBecause Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were still honing their songwriting skills, only &quot;Empty Heart&quot; and &quot;2120 South Michigan Avenue&quot; were credited to &quot;Nanker Phelge&quot;, a pseudonym for band-written compositions. The rest of the EP is composed of R&amp;B covers from some of their favourite artists. Andrew Loog Oldham produced Five by Five and even contributed liner notes (a tradition begun here) where he lists the band's achievements thus far (and stretches the truth by claiming The Rolling Stones' debut album had spent 30 weeks at #1 when it, in fact, was at the top for 12).\n\nThe full recording of &quot;2120 South Michigan Avenue&quot;, now heard on the remastered 12 X 5, was faded early here for lack of time available on a conventional EP in 1964.\n\nFive by Five reached #1 in the UK EP chart, while its five tracks and namesake would form the basis for their second American album, 12 X 5, later in 1964.\n\nFive by Five was reissued on Compact Disc in 2004 on the Singles 1963Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1965 box set through ABKCO Records.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;If You Need Me&quot; (Wilson Pickett/Robert Bateman) \t2:03\n2. \t&quot;Empty Heart&quot;   \t2:37\n3. \t&quot;2120 South Michigan Avenue&quot;   \t2:07\n4. \t&quot;Confessin' the Blues&quot; (Jay McShann/Walter Brown) \t2:48\n5. \t&quot;Around and Around&quot; (Chuck Berry) \t3:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea1ec2cc4714c77d73b11aa1cfa24dfc7efd7df0","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Five+By+Five+EP+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea1ec2cc4714c77d73b11aa1cfa24dfc7efd7df0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,30,194,204,71,20,199,125,115,177,26,161,207,162,77,252,126,253,125,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
