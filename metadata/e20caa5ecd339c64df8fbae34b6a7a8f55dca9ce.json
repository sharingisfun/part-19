It was released as the band's second single on October 3, 1987 and reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number sixty-seven on the UK Singles Chart. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; was backed with a live cover of AC/DC's &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot;, while in the United States the B-side was &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; from Appetite for Destruction. The 12&quot; vinyl and 12&quot; picture disc editions of the single also featured &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot;, in addition to live versions of &quot;It's So Easy&quot; and &quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot;.\n\nIn spite of the early morning airtime, the song's music video caught viewers' attention and quickly became MTV's most requested video. The video in question begins with a shot of Axl Rose disembarking a bus[New York]]. Slash can be seen briefly, sitting against a wall and drinking from a clear glass bottle in a brown paper bag. As Axl stops to watch a television through a store window, clips of the band playing live can be seen. By the end of the video Axl has transformed into a city punk, wearing the appropriate clothing, after going through a process similar to the Ludovico technique.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e20caa5ecd339c64df8fbae34b6a7a8f55dca9ce","amp;dn":"Guns+N+Roses+-+Welcome+To+The+Jungle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e20caa5ecd339c64df8fbae34b6a7a8f55dca9ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,12,170,94,205,51,156,100,223,143,186,227,75,106,122,143,85,220,169,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
