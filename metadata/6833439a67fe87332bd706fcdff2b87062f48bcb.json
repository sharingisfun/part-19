Amphibious landings in New Orleans and New Bern, NC would contribute to the Federal victory in the War as the Confederacy was slowly strangled. The Battles of Fort Wagner, Mobile Bay, the near-comic surrender of New Orleans, Fort Fisher ,and the story of the Swamp Angel are all told here.\n\nAs always in the T-L Civil War series, this volume is a very engaging. The writing is excellent and it is backed up by great photos, artwork and maps (although the reliance on contemporary maps is irritating in places). Sidebars look at torpedoes (naval mines), paintings of Fort Sumter, heavy artillery, Farragut's vessels, and Savannah.&quot;\n\n***\n\n&quot;Time-Life always does a good job. The illustrations are excellent and the text is quite readable. It lacks somewhat in analysis and detail, but one could do a lot worse in terms of an overview of coastal and littoral operations in the Civil War.&quot;\n\nAmazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6833439a67fe87332bd706fcdff2b87062f48bcb","amp;dn":"The+coastal+war+-+Chesapeake+Bay+to+Rio+Grande+%28Time-Life+The+Ci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6833439a67fe87332bd706fcdff2b87062f48bcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,51,67,154,103,254,135,51,43,215,6,252,223,242,184,112,98,244,139,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
