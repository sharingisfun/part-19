There are many entries in this dictionaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nthose on Architecture, Colour, Cross, Graphics, Mandala, Numbers, Serpent, \nWater, Zodiac, to give a few examplesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which can be read as independent essays.\nFOREWORD x \nBut in general the greatest use of the volume will be for the elucidation of those \nmany symbols which we encounter in the arts and in the history of ideas. Man, \nit has been said, is a symbolizing animal; it is evident that at no stage in the \ndevelopment of civilization has man been able to dispense with symbols. Science \nand technology have not freed man from his dependence on symbols: indeed, it \nmight be argued that they have increased his need for them. In any case, symbology \nitself is now a science, and this volume is a necessary instrument in its study. \nHERBERT READ\n\n\nBritish Library Cataloging in Publication Data available. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b35318093dbe7a6ac3954c02a3df8fadbcbd8bd","amp;dn":"A+Dictionary+Of+Symbols+%282001%29+Bma%C3%82%C2%A9+%5BDICCIONARIO+DE+SIMBOLOS+TR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b35318093dbe7a6ac3954c02a3df8fadbcbd8bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,53,49,128,147,219,231,166,172,57,84,192,42,61,248,250,219,203,216,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
