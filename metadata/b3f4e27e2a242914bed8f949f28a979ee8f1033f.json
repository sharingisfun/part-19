While these recordings can seem a tad earnest and dated today, they were overlooked influences upon early folk-rockers such as the Jefferson Airplane, the We Five, the Mamas and the Papas, and Fairport Convention, all of whom utilized similar blends of male/female lead/harmony vocals. They were also inspirations to fellow Canadian singer/songwriters such as Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and Gordon Lightfoot. Like most acoustic folkies, after the mid-'60s they moved into folk-rock and country-rock, though the results were less impressive than their early work.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ian-sylvia-p2016/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ian-sylvia-p2016/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by William Ruhlmann):\n\nLicensed from Universal Music Special Markets, this CD combines the contents of Ian &amp; Sylvia's seventh (Lovin' Sound; 1967) and ninth (Full Circle; 1968) albums. Why, one may wonder, not combine, say, the duo's seventh and eighth (Nashville; 1968) albums or, even more logically, their eighth and ninth (both of which were recorded in Nashville, TN, in 1968) instead? The answer lies in the vagaries of Ian &amp; Sylvia's record label affiliations. They recorded six albums for the small independent Vanguard and then signed to MGM Records, a much larger entity, for which they recorded Lovin' Sound. Sylvia Tyson is fond of telling interviewers (as she did annotator Richie Unterberger for this set) that the Vanguard contract was &quot;ambiguous,&quot; but Vanguard's lawyers did not see it that way, and they claimed that Ian &amp; Sylvia still owed the company one more album. When they prevailed, Nashville went to Vanguard, and the duo returned to MGM for Full Circle. So, this collection combines Lovin' Sound and Full Circle because those are the two albums in the MGM catalog, now controlled by Universal, while Vanguard has since been sold to the Welk Music Group. As such, the listener gets to hear two distinct phases of Ian &amp; Sylvia's work. On Lovin' Sound, they were adapting to the folk-rock style of the mid-'60s, discreetly adding keyboards, electric guitar, bass, and drums, along with the occasional string chart, to their folk-based original songs and covers by Tim Hardin, Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash. ...\n\n\nRead all of the review at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/lovin-soundfull-circle-r1020957/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/lovin-soundfull-circle-r1020957/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000IO64&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000IO64&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
