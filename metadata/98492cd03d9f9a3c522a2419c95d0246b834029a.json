Since World War II, the world has believed that US foreign policy means well, and that America's motives in spreading democracy are honorable, even noble.  In this startling and provocative book from William Blum, one of the United States' leading non-mainstream chroniclers of American foreign policy and author of the popular online newsletter, Anti-Empire Reports, demonstrates that nothing could be further from the truth.  America's Deadliest Export is the in-depth exposÃƒÂ© of the many contradictions surrounding the nature of US foreign policy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98492cd03d9f9a3c522a2419c95d0246b834029a","amp;dn":"America%27s+Deadliest+Export+-+Democracy+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98492cd03d9f9a3c522a2419c95d0246b834029a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,73,44,208,61,159,154,60,82,42,36,25,201,93,2,70,184,52,2,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
