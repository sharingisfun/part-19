Two-Faced Woman was Garbo's final screen appearance, as the legendary actress slipped into a reclusive existence that lasted until her death. This George Cukor romantic comedy casts Garbo as ski instructor Karin Borg Blake. She gives lessons to wealthy American playboy Larry Blake (Melvyn Douglas), and the two fall in love and marry even though Larry has a girlfriend named Griselda Vaughn (Constance Bennett) waiting for him back in New York. Returning to New York, Karin fears that Griselda will win Larry back. In an effort to foil Larry's imagined dalliance, Karin poses as her own twin sister, Katherine, hoping to get Larry to fall in love with her instead of Griselda. Larry is onto the scheme and plays along with her, pretending to fall in love with Katherine. But this infuriates Karin, who can't believe that her husband would fall in love with her sister, and she storms back to her ski resort. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034328/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034328/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsubs &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3340788/two-faced-woman-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3340788/two-faced-woman-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nGeorge Cukor\n\n        Greta Garbo\t ... \tKarin Borg Blake\n\n\tMelvyn Douglas\t... \tLawrence 'Larry' Blake\n\n\tConstance Bennett\t... \tGriselda Vaughn\n\tRoland Young\t... \tO.
