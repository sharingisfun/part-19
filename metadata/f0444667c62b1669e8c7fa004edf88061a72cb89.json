Forget about the higher price and the fact that 40 songs might seem to be more Drifters than most casual listeners would want -- All-Time Greatest Hits &amp; More: 1959-1965 is a towering and magnificent collection of some of the best popular R&amp;B ever done this side of Sam Cooke. And, as with Sam Cooke, the beautiful part of the Drifters' work during this period is that any look beyond and behind their hits reveals a lot more songs that were every bit as good as those hits. There's not even a slightly weak track anywhere on All-Time Greatest Hits &amp; More, which contains the biggest hits Ben E. King, Rudy Lewis, and Johnny Moore sang for the group. &quot;There Goes My Baby,&quot; &quot;This Magic Moment,&quot; &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me,&quot; &quot;Sweets for My Sweet,&quot; &quot;I Count the Tears,&quot; &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful,&quot; &quot;Up on the Roof,&quot; &quot;On Broadway,&quot; and &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; are all here, mastered in surprisingly good sound for the late '80s. There's a lot more than that, however -- the producers have also included killer B-sides (such as &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;) that hadn't been in print since the mid-'60s, and they've dug even deeper to throw in finished tracks that were left in the vaults until the '70s. The notes by Colin Escott are an added bonus, displaying his usual command for historical detail.\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] There Goes My Baby\n[02] Oh My Love\n[03] Baltimore\n[04] Hey Senorita\n[05] Dance With Me\n[06] (If You Cry) True Love,True Love\n[07] This Magic Moment\n[08] Lonely Winds\n[09] Nobody But Me\n[10] Save The Last Dance For Me\n[11] I Count The Tears\n[12] Sometimes I Wonder\n[13] Please Stay\n[14] Room Full Of Tears\n[15] Sweets For My Sweet\n[16] Some Kind Of Wonderful\n[17] Loneliness Or Happiness\n[18] Mexican Divorce\n[19] Somebody New Dancing With You\n[20] Jackpot\n\nCD01 Play Time - 00h:49m:55s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] She Never Talked To Me That Way\n[02] When My Little Girl Is Smiling\n[03] Stranger On The Shore\n[04] What To Do\n[05] Up On The Roof\n[06] Another Night With The Boys\n[07] I Feel Good All Over\n[08] Let The Music Play\n[09] On Broadway\n[10] I'll Take You Home\n[11] If You Don't Come Back\n[12] Didn't It\n[13] One Way Love\n[14] He's Just A Playboy\n[15] Under The Boardwalk\n[16] I Don't Want To Go On Without You\n[17] I've Got Sand In My Shoes\n[18] Saturday Night At The Movies\n[19] At The Club\n[20] Come On Over To My Place\n\nCD02 Play Time - 00h:53m:01s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:42m:58s:\nTotal File Size....................... 613mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
