Nowadays, X-ray techniques, such as X-ray fluorescense and diffraction are standard tools. This book offers physicists, art historians, archaeologists, curators, and conservators a detailed overview via contributions written by leading scientists in the field. The book contains scientific data, i.e. in situ measurement data taken with portable XRF and XRD, and fine data taken with accelerating ion beams and synchrotron radiations, together with their explanations. Results obtained by traditional scientific methods are also reviewed. The broad data collection spans experimental data taken both from monuments in the field and exhibits in museums, for example:\n\nancient Egyptian wall-painting pigments\nancient Egyptian wooden statues and mummies\nancient Greek funerary monuments\nCypriot ceramics\nmedieval, Lyubliana and Venetian glass\nRomanian ceramics\nancient Near-Eastern clay\nold Japanese porcelain\npre-Hispanic items from America\nancient Chinese underglaze-red\nblue and white porcelain\nChinese celadon\nPhoenician cosmetics\n\nAlso included are data from glazes, ancient gold and silver coins, gold jewelleries, gold alloys, corroded metals, gemstones (ruby, emerald and garnet), painting pigments, pottery, bronze, obsidian, stucco, turquoise, and so on. The discussion fostered here between natural scientists and archaeologists anticipates the future direction of archaeology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10e313396a835c5b37a1ce40d3017d75c9190350","amp;dn":"X-Rays+for+Archaeology.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10e313396a835c5b37a1ce40d3017d75c9190350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,227,19,57,106,131,92,91,55,161,206,64,211,1,125,117,201,25,3,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
