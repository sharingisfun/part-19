All of his music was professionnally driven by a smooth fiddle (borrowed and never returned!) that cut through a unique musical home-grown output that is today highly sought after by collectors and listeners alike, who seek to find the music behind one of the originators of modern-day Cajun music.\n\n''27 track compilation covers the full range of this cajun fiddler/guitarist's earliest 1940 sides w. the Rayne Bo Ramblers to his final sessions. A followup to &quot;Jole Blon&quot; and thirteen other performances, it includes the Hank Williams inspired &quot;Cat 'n Around.&quot; It has a rough sound but great music, blending Cajun, swing, and honky tonk.''\n\n01.
