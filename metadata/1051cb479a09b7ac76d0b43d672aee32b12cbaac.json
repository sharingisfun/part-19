Out, out, brief candle!\nLife's but a walking shadow, a poor player\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nSignifying nothing. \n\nA study in evil, supernatural terror, and that grey eminence of history, guilt. 'Fear' is the word that occurs most often, and darkness, claustrophobic solitude and an incommunicable nervous dread pervade the Macbeth world, spreading as mental infection. \n\nThe Caedmon recording dating from 1960 with Anthony Quayle in the title role. A CD rip. The sound is first-rate as is the performance.\n\n (Kindly seed, and if you can't find a seed for any previous poetry torrent go to the folder 'Current Poetry Torrents' and follow the instructions on the pdf.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1051cb479a09b7ac76d0b43d672aee32b12cbaac","amp;dn":"William+Shakespeare+-+10+-+Macbeth+-+Caedmon+1960","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1051cb479a09b7ac76d0b43d672aee32b12cbaac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,81,203,71,154,9,183,172,118,208,180,61,103,42,238,50,177,44,186,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
