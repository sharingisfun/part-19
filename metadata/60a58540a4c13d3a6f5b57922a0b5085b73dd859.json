In this provocative and fascinating work, Aaron J. Cohen shows how World War I changed Russian culture and especially Russian art. A wartime public culture destabilized conventional patterns in cultural politics and aesthetics and fostered a new artistic world by integrating the iconoclastic avant-garde into the art establishment and mass culture. This new wartime culture helped give birth to nonobjective abstraction (including Kazimir MalevichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous Black Square), which revolutionized modern aesthetics. Of the new institutions, new public behaviors, and new cultural forms that emerged from this artistic engagement with war, some continued, others were reinterpreted, and still others were destroyed during the revolutionary period","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60a58540a4c13d3a6f5b57922a0b5085b73dd859","amp;dn":"Imagining+the+Unimaginable%3A+World+War%2C+Modern+Art%2C+and+the+Polit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60a58540a4c13d3a6f5b57922a0b5085b73dd859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,165,133,64,164,193,61,58,111,91,87,146,42,11,80,133,183,61,216,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
