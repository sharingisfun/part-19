Albert Dekker chews the scenery as mad scientist Dr. Thorkel, who has developed a process that will shrink human beings to doll size. His first victims include mining engineers Bill Stockton (Thomas Coley) and Steve Baker (Victor Kilian) and biologists Mary Mitchell (Janice Logan) and Dr. Bullfinch (Charles Halton). At first willing to play-act the role of benevolent despot with his miniaturized captives, Thorkel reveals the more sinister side of his personality by abruptly murdering Bullfinch in cold blood (easily the film's most frightening sequence). The rest of the picture details the escape efforts of the three pint-sized protagonists as they hack their way through a jungle of gigantic foliage and do battle with oversized wildlife. Though the cheery Technicolor hues tend to dilute the &quot;scare&quot; quotient in Dr. Cyclops, the special effects are superbly convincing throughout.\n\nRip Specs (HD TV Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Dr.Cyclops.1940.HQTV.720p.x264.AC3.[FrOnkY].mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 3 658 Kbps\nLength            : 1.96 GiB for 1h 16mn 44s 392ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 3 456 Kbps\nAspect            : 984 x 720 (1.367) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : fr\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032412/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032412/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: Spanish, English, French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58756e95982350d4bf503a7d079c8653e808a51","amp;dn":"Dr.Cyclops.1940.HQTV.720p.x264.AC3.%5BFrOnkY%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58756e95982350d4bf503a7d079c8653e808a51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,135,86,233,89,130,53,13,75,245,3,167,208,121,200,101,62,128,138,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
