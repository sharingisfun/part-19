She writes and performs music with a strong folk and roots feel, her songs dealing with a variety of issues from alcoholism to genocide. She has been most recognised for her solo career, winning three awards at the BBC Folk Awards in 2005, and was previously a member of Malinky and Battlefield Band\n\nFolk isn't a genre that's usually associated with pressure, but given that Karine Polwart's Faultlines scooped her three awards from Radio 2, there's a certain expectation to the follow-up.\n\nScribbled In Chalk is a worthy successor. Weaving melody around her defiantly delicate timbre, the beautifully crafted tunes are as likely to bite as they are to soothe.\n\n&quot;Daisy&quot; is a warning about the dark things in the world, while &quot;Baleerie Baloo&quot; tells the true story of a Scottish missionary who died in Auschwitz. When Polwart writes, it's not about the lighter side of life.\n\nBest of all, she's pushing folk forward, with as much King Creosote as Kate Rusby to her sound. You wouldn't bet against a raft of awards for this one too.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ff3c012b0d94c021e5b4d641f82d6da1d5167a","amp;dn":"Karine+Polwart...Scribbled+in+Chalk%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ff3c012b0d94c021e5b4d641f82d6da1d5167a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,255,60,1,43,13,148,192,33,229,180,214,65,248,45,109,161,213,22,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
