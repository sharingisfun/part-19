It featured work by such notable creators as writer-editor Stan Lee, writers Gerry Conway and Archie Goodwin, and artists John Buscema, Johnny Craig, Jack Kirby, Tom Sutton, Barry Windsor-Smith (as Barry Smith), and Bernie Wrightson. Stories were generally hosted by either of the characters Digger, a gravedigger, or Headstone P. Gravely, in undertaker garb, or by one of the artists or writers.\n\nDesigned to compete with DC Comics' successful launches House of Mystery and House of Secrets, Chamber of Darkness, like its companion comic Tower of Shadows, sold poorly despite such notable talent. After its first few issues, the title began including reprints of &quot;pre-superhero Marvel&quot; monster stories and other SF/fantasy tales from Marvel's 1950s and early ' 60s predecessor, Atlas Comics. After the eighth issue, the title changed to Monsters on the Prowl, and the comic became almost exclusively a reprint book.\n\n\nTower of Shadows is available via the link below:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5009459/Tower_of_Shadows-Creatures_on_the_Loose&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5009459/Tower_of_Shadows-Creatures_on_the_Loose&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf78d56299e177a8521a9bbb448a4a187b761dbb","amp;dn":"Chamber+of+Darkness-Monsters+on+the+Prowl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf78d56299e177a8521a9bbb448a4a187b761dbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,120,213,98,153,225,119,168,82,26,155,187,68,138,74,24,123,118,29,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
