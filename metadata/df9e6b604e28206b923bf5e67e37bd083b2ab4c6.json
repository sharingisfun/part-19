Its success in France led to a second opera, two novels, and a projected third part. In 2009 a spectacular adaptation combining material from the first two parts was performed in Germany under the English title Excalibur: the Celtic Rock Opera, with great success.\n\nThe first part of an intended trilogy, Excalibur, La lÃƒÂ©gende des Celtes blended musical styles and was performed by Roger Hodgson (Supertramp), Fairport Convention, Dan Ar Braz, Tri Yann, Angelo Branduardi, Didier Lockwood, Gabriel Yacoub. The story is based on the legend of King Arthur. Narration is led by Merlin.[1] It is structured as a series of songs and instrumental interludes linked by narration, covering the birth of Arthur, the creation of Excalibur, his victory over the pagans, the rebellion of Morgana and Mordred, the search for the Holy Grail, and Arthur's final defeat and trip to Avalon. Most songs are sung in English, though some are in French and the central song, representing the triumph of Arthur and creation of Camelot, is an arrangement of a traditional Breton language folk song. A voice-over narrates events in French.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.excaliburtrilogy.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.excaliburtrilogy.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklist:\n\n1-Dihun (Orchestre Symphonique de Prague)\n2-Pour l'Amour de la Reine (Tri Yann)\n3-The Elements (Roger Hodgson)\n4-Castel Rock (Fairport Convention)\n5-Morning Song (Nikki Matheson)\n6-Celtic Dream (instrumental d'Alan Simon)\n7-Ad Libitum (Carlos Nunez et l'Orchestre symphonique de Prague)\n8-Morganne (Bohinta)\n9-The Gest of Gauvain (Fairport Convention)\n10-Davet Ar Baradoz (Denez Prigent)\n11-La Complainte de Perceval (Gabriel Yacoub)\n12-The Quest (choeurs orthodoxes bulgares &quot;PHILIPPOPOLIS&quot;)\n13-The Will of God (Roger Hodgson)\n14-Camlann (Bohinta)\n15-L'appel de Galahad (Angelo Branduardi)\n16-Excalibur (Dan Ar Braz)\n17-Vers l'Ile d'Avalon (Bruno le Rouzic)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df9e6b604e28206b923bf5e67e37bd083b2ab4c6","amp;dn":"Alan+Simon+-+Excalibur+I+-+La+L%26eacute%3Bgende+Des+Celtes+%28Flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df9e6b604e28206b923bf5e67e37bd083b2ab4c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,158,107,96,78,40,32,107,146,59,245,230,126,55,189,8,59,42,180,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
