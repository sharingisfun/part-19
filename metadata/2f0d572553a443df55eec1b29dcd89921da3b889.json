In their early\ndays, the Wailers collaborated frequently with wild\ngenius and producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, working\ntogether on well over 100 tracks in a relatively\nsmall two-year period. In that time, even when\nsharing the spotlight with Bob Marley, Perry\nencouraged Tosh to explore recording his own solo\ncompositions. Upsetters Showcase grabs several of\nTosh's best cuts from this highly fruitful and\nexperimental late-'60s/early-'70s period and\ncomplements them with other Perry-produced reggae\ncuts from the same with deejays U-Roy and Big\nYouth, as well as a few lesser-known artists. Front\nloaded with Tosh selections, the compilation kicks\noff with the brooding sway of &quot;400 Years,&quot; a sharp\nand burning rhythm ornamented by Tosh's bellowing\nanti-slavery sentiments and Perry's psychedelic\nproduction hand. Two versions of a more ska-\nflavored Tosh tune, &quot;Brand New Second Hand,&quot; also\nshow up here, hinting at the songwriter's mellower\nroots, especially when placed next to more\npolitically minded, dub-friendly tunes like\n&quot;Downpressor.&quot; Framing Upsetters Showcase as a\nPeter Tosh album is misleading, as after the first\nfew selections, the majority of the rest of the\ncollection is filled with tunes from ska vocalist\nDave Barker to the Jimmy Cliff-modeled melodic\nroots grooves of Carl Dawkins. As with anything\nbearing the Perry name, this is top-notch reggae\nand a multifaceted cross-section of varying styles\nand sounds.\n\nHappy 10-Years to SPLiFF!!\n\na b o u t  g r o u p  a n d  g r e e t s\n\nShout Outs To:\n\nAll groups/contributors putting out\ngood vibes.
