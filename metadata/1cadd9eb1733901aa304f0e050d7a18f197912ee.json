He stands at a crossroad in his life, his morality and religion at odds with the brutality of his chosen profession. Stepping ashore, he starts on a journey of redemption that will end in tragedy but proves the catalyst for greater achievements. A local anthem sung in adversity by the slaves he captures punctuates the film. It will be the inspiration for John NewtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s redemption, and, years later, for his writing of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most enduring hymn, Amazing Grace.\n\nPlz SEED SEED as long as possible....\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=2171&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=2171&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUploaded By Abraham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cadd9eb1733901aa304f0e050d7a18f197912ee","amp;dn":"The+Amazing+Grace%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cadd9eb1733901aa304f0e050d7a18f197912ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,173,217,235,23,51,144,26,163,4,240,224,80,215,161,143,25,121,18,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
