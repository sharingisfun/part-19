Kimerling (Wiley-VCH, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nRepresenting a further step towards enabling the convergence of computing and communication, this handbook and reference treats germanium electronics and optics on an equal footing. Renowned experts paint the big picture, combining both introductory material and the latest results.\r\nThe first part of the book introduces readers to the fundamental properties of germanium, such as band offsets, impurities, defects and surface structures, which determine the performance of germanium-based devices in conjunction with conventional silicon technology. The second part covers methods of preparing and processing germanium structures, including chemical and physical vapor deposition, condensation approaches and chemical etching. The third and largest part gives a broad overview of the applications of integrated germanium technology: waveguides, photodetectors, modulators, ring resonators, transistors and, prominently, light-emitting devices.\r\nAn invaluable one-stop resource for both researchers and developers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:658d58a9bee1502a1cc437f5323b4e67e3cc7c28","amp;dn":"Photonics+and+Electronics+with+Germanium","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"658d58a9bee1502a1cc437f5323b4e67e3cc7c28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,141,88,169,190,225,80,42,28,196,55,245,50,59,78,103,227,204,124,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
