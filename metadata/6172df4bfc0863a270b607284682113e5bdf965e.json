An unusual piece of cheese. Made from an old family recipe, AmbrosioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cheese was reputed to be among the finest in the world, and was said to hold mystical qualities. Eating it, some claimed, conjured long-lost memories. But then, Ambrosio said, things had gone horribly wrong. . . .\n\nBy the time the two men exited the telling room that evening, Paterniti was hooked. Soon he was fully embroiled in village life, relocating his young family to GuzmÃƒÂ¡n in order to chase the truth about this cheese and explore the fairy taleÃ¢â‚¬â€œlike place where the villagers conversed with farm animals, lived by an ancient Castilian code of honor, and made their wine and food by hand, from the grapes growing on a nearby hill and the flocks of sheep floating over the Meseta.\n\nWhat Paterniti ultimately discovers there in the highlands of Castile is nothing like the idyllic slow-food fable he first imagined. Instead, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sucked into the heart of an unfolding mystery, a blood feud that includes accusations of betrayal and theft, death threats, and a murder plot. As the village begins to spill its long-held secrets, Paterniti finds himself implicated in the very story he is writing.\n\nEqual parts mystery and memoir, travelogue and history, The Telling Room is an astonishing work of literary nonfiction by one of our most accomplished storytellers. A moving exploration of happiness, friendship, and betrayal, The Telling Room introduces us to Ambrosio Molinos de las Heras, an unforgettable real-life literary hero, while also holding a mirror up to the world, fully alive to the power of stories that define and sustain us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6172df4bfc0863a270b607284682113e5bdf965e","amp;dn":"Michael+Paterniti+-+The+Telling+Room.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6172df4bfc0863a270b607284682113e5bdf965e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,114,223,75,252,8,99,162,112,182,7,40,70,130,17,62,91,223,150,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
