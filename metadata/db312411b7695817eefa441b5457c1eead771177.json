Don Castro of the Buddhist Churches of America (Jodo Shinshu tradition). It can be found on the Internet as a strange, rather distracting video. I find this audio-only version easier to deal with,\n\nGreen Dharma is a PDF from www.traditionalyogastudies.com, full of useful information and ideas. It is not the book of the same title that I knew back in the seventies. I can find no evidence now that that the earlier book ever existed.\n\nMountain Silence, issue 8, is a PDF magazine dedicated to &quot;Buddhist perspectives on ecology.&quot;\n\nTake what you need, please seed and share and check my torrents for a range of Buddhist material.
