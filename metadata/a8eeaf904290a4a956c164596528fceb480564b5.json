They are constantly revealing ways for me to further grasp my own Limitless nature, and to truly Become A Living God, here and now!\nWhat has always been even more interesting to me, though, is when they speak to me, but they speak in a language I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand.\nSometimes, these messages turn out to be in Latin, Greek, Zulu, or Portuguese, and these turn out to be one or two words, like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black SerpentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stairs into Darkness,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or other such cryptic communications.\nSometimes, though, the messages arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t words or sentences at all, but are incantations, words of power whose translations are meaningless next to the raw power invoked and presenced through their speaking.\nAt first, these seemed like some false, invented language, having substance in my subconscious mind only.\nAnd then I decided to share a few of them with other people, other magicians, who used them and attested to their potency.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8eeaf904290a4a956c164596528fceb480564b5","amp;dn":"4+Incantations+To+Conjure+Limitless+Power+by+E.A+Koetting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8eeaf904290a4a956c164596528fceb480564b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,238,175,144,66,144,164,169,86,193,100,89,101,40,252,235,72,5,100,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
