Binzel&amp;#039;s amazing book Alive and Well - One Doctor&amp;#039;s Experience With Nutrition in the Treatment of Cancer Patients (1994) which is a superb story of one doctor&amp;#039;s fight for the right to practice medicine in accordance with one&amp;#039;s own conscience and not with mainstream practices of drugs, surgery and radiation which are killing thousands and curing nobody. Dr. Binzel has been using Laetrile and other nutritional therapies in the treatment of cancer patients since the mid 1970s and his record of success is simply astounding. He tells of his ongoing battle with the medical establishment, but this book is primarily the story of his alive-and-well patients, many of whom had been told by their previous doctors that they had only a few months to live. Medical case histories are included. Alive and Well is one doctor&amp;#039;s experience with nutrition in the treatment of cancer and guess what - it worked. 130 pages. A must read for everyone.
