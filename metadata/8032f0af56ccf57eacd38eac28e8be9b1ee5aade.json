Well known for its members' black and white face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s with their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Counting the 1978 solo albums, Kiss has been awarded 28 gold albums to date, the most of any American rock band. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 20 million have been certified by the RIAA and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million records, making them one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling bands of all time. The original 1973Ã¢â‚¬â€œ80 lineup consisted of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals).\n\nWith their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley) and Catman (Criss). Stanley became the &quot;Starchild&quot; because of his tendency to be referred to as the &quot;starry-eyed lover&quot; and &quot;hopeless romantic&quot;. The &quot;Demon&quot; makeup reflected Simmons' cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Frehley's &quot;Spaceman&quot; makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and his supposedly being from another planet. Criss' &quot;Catman&quot; makeup was in accordance with the belief that he had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley were out of the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes had waned considerably by that point.\n\nBuoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again, but the band continues with Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer. Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members. Kiss has been named in many &quot;Top&quot; lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's '100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock',[5] 9th on 'The Greatest Metal Bands' list by MTV, number one on Hit Paraders's &quot;Top 100 Live Bands&quot;, 56th on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists Of All Time&quot;, and 26th on Gibson's &quot;50 Greatest American Rock Bands&quot;. The band is set to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, nearly 15 years after becoming eligible.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8032f0af56ccf57eacd38eac28e8be9b1ee5aade","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+2012-13+-+26+Albums+Mini+LP+SHM-CD+Discography+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8032f0af56ccf57eacd38eac28e8be9b1ee5aade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,50,240,175,86,204,245,126,172,211,142,172,40,232,190,155,30,229,170,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
