However, to solve the arcane relationship between mythology and factual history has not become possible yet; only hypothesis have been experimented\nso far. Historians of the world have accepted a general view in order to ease the concept of history and provide the students of Indian history around the globe its access. This book is a comprehensive\nstudy of India's history. The facts and dates listed here are in complete resonance with that of the general view about India's history all over the world. The book has been divided into\ntwo volumes that provide the readers with an opportunity to carry an exhaustive study of Indian history.\n\nGoing through the volume, the readers will find immeasurable information regarding the social, religious and administrative structure of the India of yesteryears. While a few chapters in the\nvolume discuss various aspects of medieval India, providing a concluding feature to the previous volume, there are also chapters on the advent of Mughals and Babur's reign that reveal a\nnew aspect of the India known across the globe. Moving from medieval history, the book goes on to present the various aspects of Modern India. The English rule over India and\nthe country's struggle for independence form a major chunk of the volume.\n\nFormat: E-book\nISBN-10: 9350437929\nISBN-13: 9789350437926\nLanguage: English\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
