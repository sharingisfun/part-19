Great section on water quality and the relationship between hardness and pH. I also love the section on anatomy and biology of fish, and how to set up an aquarium. Not only does the book deal with fresh and marine fishes, but it also has a section on invertebrates and plants. \n\n\n\nSharing is Caring.
