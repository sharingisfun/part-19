It&amp;#039;s a high concept, but Return of Saturn is filled with satisfying contradictions. It&amp;#039;s melodic, but deceptively complex; it can seem frothy, but it&amp;#039;s never frivolous. No Doubt&amp;#039;s desire to expand the emotional template of new wave is the perfect match for Stefani&amp;#039;s themes -- she may be writing about love, but she&amp;#039;s not writing adolescent love songs. Fragments of her teenaged romantic fantasies remain, but she&amp;#039;s writing as a woman in her late 20s. She&amp;#039;s tired of being another &quot;ex-girlfriend&quot; -- she wants to fall in love, get married, and have a family. It&amp;#039;s a subject that&amp;#039;s surprisingly uncommon in pop music, which would alone make Return of Saturn an interesting album. What makes it a successful one is that the band delivers an aural equivalent of Stefani&amp;#039;s lyrical themes. They also begin with their adolescent musical ideals, adding depth and detail to their pop-ska foundation. They balance their non-ironic love of new wave with contemporary production and a sensibility borrowed from classic rock: that albums are greater than the sum of their parts. Surprisingly, they pull it off -- it&amp;#039;s a far stronger record than Tragic Kingdom, even if the catchiest numbers don&amp;#039;t have the same swagger and punch as their previous hit singles. So be it. With Return of Saturn, No Doubt have made a terrific, layered record that exceeds any expectations set by Tragic Kingdom. Not only have they found their voice, they know what to do with it.\n\nArtist...............: No Doubt\nAlbum................: Return of Saturn\nGenre................: \nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2000\nRipper...............: Exact Audio Copy   (Secure mode) &amp; \nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.0 20070715\u0012\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 69 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............:  on 9/6/2008\nPosted by............:  on 9/6/2008\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO, CUE, EAC Logfile\nCovers...............: Front CD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73b5d5b5cbe8e42f92d2e77a7f791089561b4086","amp;dn":"No+Doubt+-+Return+Of+Saturn%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73b5d5b5cbe8e42f92d2e77a7f791089561b4086","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,181,213,181,203,232,228,47,146,210,231,122,127,121,16,137,86,27,64,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
