In vivid behind-the-scenes detail, he reveals proof of the extreme degree to which our government officials bent over backward to serve the interests of Wall Street firms at the expense of the broader publicÃ¢â‚¬â€and at the expense of effective financial reform. During the height of the financial crisis in 2008, Barofsky gave up his job as a prosecutor in the esteemed U.S. AttorneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Office in New York City, where he had convicted drug kingpins, Wall Street executives, and perpetrators of mortgage fraud, to become the special inspector general in charge of oversight of the spending of the bailout money. From his first day on the job, his efforts to protect against fraud and to hold the big banks accountable for how they spent taxpayer money were met with outright hostility from the Treasury officials in charge of the bailouts.\n\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n               Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962e75fdeb893524130fd56572f022bcb9a99adf","amp;dn":"Bailout+by+Neil+Barofsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962e75fdeb893524130fd56572f022bcb9a99adf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,46,117,253,235,137,53,36,19,15,213,101,114,240,34,188,185,169,154,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
