Support for 1080P+ (I use 1440p but this should work with 1600p and perhaps hgher).\n*Extreme End Pack S3TC Textures (All made to date. (More are likely to come in the future.)\n*High End Pack S3TC (Other textures not available by the Extreme End Pack)\n*Epic Games: S3TC Texture Pack from CD2 of UTGOTY(Other textures not available by either the High End Pack or the Extreme End Pack)*Seperate archive including mundane, unnecessary files for the game as well as, the original texture files, OpenGL(and older OpenGL), and old Direct3D drivers for those on Windows XP as well as an older machine that cant want to play newer textures.\n*Optimized UnrealTournament.ini file for the best Graphic and Audio performance. (High Digital Quality Audio, Antialiasing, aniscoptric filtering, among other audio/video settings)\n\n**Please Note**: Some anti-cheat servers have specific files that check for cheats and mistakenly identify new textures as well as the drivers as cheats.  This may be able to be worked around.. Stay tuned.  Also: these \ntextures do not work with Unreal Editor, use the ones in the Extras.7z file for that as well.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nExtract UT.7z to the folder of your desire with your favorite extractor (WinRAR, 7-zip, etc..), Run UnrealTournament.exe from the \\\\\\\\SYSTEM\\\\\\\\ folder.
