He is a man on the run from Earth's heroes, who want to see him brought to justice. Some want him tried before a world court, while others want retribution; and some simply want him dead as quickly and as quietly as possible. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlease continue to seed so that others may enjoy also. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e43a0036f36d49c9c53b425637a30fcaf4b7a7","amp;dn":"Black+Adam+-+The+Dark+Age+%231-6+%28DC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e43a0036f36d49c9c53b425637a30fcaf4b7a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,228,58,0,54,243,109,73,201,197,59,66,86,55,163,15,202,244,183,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
