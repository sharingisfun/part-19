DÃƒÂ©livrance\n\nAlcest is a French shoegazing band/musical project (formerly a black metal band) from Bagnols-sur-CÃƒÂ¨ze, France, founded and led by Neige (StÃƒÂ©phane Paut).[4] It began in 2000 as a black metal solo project by Neige, soon a trio, but following the release of their first demo in 2001, band members Aegnor and Argoth left the band, leaving Neige as the sole member.[5]\n\nThis marked a change in style, as Alcest's subsequent releases have more often been described as shoegazing mixing numerous rock and metal influences, including black metal and post-metal. In 2009 the ex-Peste Noire's drummer Winterhalter (now in Les Discrets) joined Alcest's studio line-up, after eight years with Neige as the sole full time member. Since its creation, Alcest has released three studio albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eada50d2ad00b818d8fac89514506828ec448d1c","amp;dn":"Alcest+-+Shelter+%282014%29+by+nofuture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eada50d2ad00b818d8fac89514506828ec448d1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,218,80,210,173,0,184,24,216,250,200,149,20,80,104,40,236,68,141,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
