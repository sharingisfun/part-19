After introducing the reader to the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history from the origins of Islam in the seventh century, A History of the Modern Middle East focuses on the past two centuries of profound and often dramatic change. \nAlthough built around a framework of political history, the book also carefully integrates social, cultural, and economic developments into a single, expertly crafted account. In updating this fifth edition of the late William ClevelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popular introductory text, Martin Bunton provides a thorough account of the major transformative developments over the past four years, including a new chapter on the tumultuous Arab uprisings and the participation of Islamist parties in a new political order in the Middle East.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4438bc5cf52e75e45b2da040737e126c17dd017c","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+Modern+Middle++-+William+L+Cleveland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4438bc5cf52e75e45b2da040737e126c17dd017c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,56,188,92,245,46,117,228,91,45,160,64,115,126,18,108,23,221,1,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
