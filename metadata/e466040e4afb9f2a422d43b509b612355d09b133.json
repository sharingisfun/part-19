Here, lives intertwine and unravel. A widower struggles with his love for an unmarried cousin. Bakul, a motherless daughter, runs wild with Mukunda, an orphan of unknown caste adopted by the family. Confined in a room at the top of the house, a matriarch goes slowly mad; her husband searches for its cause as he shapes and reshapes his garden. As Mukunda and Bakul grow, their intense closeness matures into something else, and Mukunda is banished to Calcutta. He prospers in the turbulent years after Partition, but his thoughts stay with his home, with Bakul, with all that he has lostÃ¢â‚¬â€and he knows that he must return.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e466040e4afb9f2a422d43b509b612355d09b133","amp;dn":"An+Atlas+of+Impossible+Longing+-+Anuradha+Roy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e466040e4afb9f2a422d43b509b612355d09b133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,102,4,14,74,251,159,42,66,45,67,181,9,182,18,53,93,9,177,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
