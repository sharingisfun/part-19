He was smart enough to take Big Bill BroonzyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early advice about developing a style to call his own to heart, instead of imitating that of his idol, Roosevelt Sykes. Soon enough, other 88s pounders were copying Slim rather than the other way around; his thundering ivories attack set him apart from most of his contemporaries, while his deeply burnished voice possessed a commanding authority.\nAs befits his stage name, John ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPeterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Chatman was born and raised in Memphis; a great place to commit to a career as a bluesman. Sometime in the late ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢30s, he resettled in Chicago and began recording as a leader in 1939 for OKeh, then switched over to Bluebird the next year. Around the same time, Slim joined forces with Broonzy, then the dominant force on the local blues scene. After serving as BroonzyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s invaluable accompanist for a few years, Slim emerged as his own man in 1944. ~Bill Dahl\n\nTracklist:\n01. Beer Drinking Woman (3:20)\n02.
