The premise of this work is that racism and slavery in America are the result of an unintentional historical intertwining of various Western philosophical, religious, cultural, social, economic, and political strands of thought that date back to the Classical Era. These strands have become tangled in a Gordian knot, which can only be unraveled through the bold application of a variety of multidisciplinary tools. By doing so, this book is intended help the reader understand how the United States, a nation that claims 'all men are created equal,' could be responsible for slavery and the intractable threads of racism and inequality that have become woven into its cultural the fabric.\n\n\n\n[b]Review[/b]\n\nWith rigorous historical analysis that excavates the centrality of white supremacy to institutions and beliefs that constitute the very core of the United States, We Hold These Truths offers fresh insights into the complexity of contemporary debates surrounding race and power. Readers will be moved to think, and more importantly to act, by Addison's evocative writing, detailed analysis and striking imagery. An iconoclastic text, We Hold These Truths is a must-read for students invested in economic, gender and racial justice, across the disciplines. (Dr. Erica Meiners, author of Right to be Hostile: Schools, Prisons, and the Making of Public Enemies and co-author of Disruptive Readings on Making )\n\nDr. Addison's analysis of the roots of racism in the U.S. on one level is an exploration and documentation of the underpinnings of the thinking that underlies colonial avarice and acquisition and its accompanying, ongoing, rationalizing/ authorizing / legitimizing/ ideology. On another level, it is an exposÃƒÂ© - a portrait of Americans in stark contradiction with themselves: clinging to the mythic narrative of &quot;liberty, equality, justice for all&quot; while surrounded by the &quot;toxic air of indifference and racism&quot; aimed at those at the bottom of the well, as Addison puts it, following Derrick Bell, &quot;cast aside like so much 'refuse'&quot;.
