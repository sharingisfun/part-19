Their self-titled debut was released on 2007 by Alive Records, and was produced by The Black Keys&amp;#039; Dan Auerbach.\nDan was given a demo by Parker after a Black Keys gig in Colorado, and he liked it so much that he offered to produce their debut album in his own studio, The Pie Co, in Akron OH. Griggs originally cut his teeth playing garage punk, but his sound, although heavily influenced by sixties garage music, is also channeled through the blues, with experimental breakdowns, unpredictable tempo changes, crazy rave-ups and fuzzed out psychedelic guitar work; the result is an exciting and truly distinctive sound.\nParker plays all the instruments on the album except for bass, played by Duff, and slide guitar on &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; which is played by Dan. The trio will be touring throughout 2007.\n\n-courtesy of last.fm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be9733e9a352723f07f3db668cdb52e6f7cc4056","amp;dn":"Radio+Moscow+S%2FT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be9733e9a352723f07f3db668cdb52e6f7cc4056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,151,51,233,163,82,114,63,7,243,219,102,140,219,82,230,247,204,64,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
