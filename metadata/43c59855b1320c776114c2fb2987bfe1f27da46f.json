The third track, &quot;Vincent,&quot; is a tribute to the famed artist Vincent Van Gogh.\n\nThe original 1971 LP is dedicated to Buddy Holly[1], and was reissued in 1980 minus the track &quot;Sister Fatima&quot;.[2] The original United Artists Records inner sleeve featured a free verse poem written by McLean about the late William Boyd, also known as Hopalong Cassidy, along with a picture of Boyd in full Hopalong regalia. This sleeve was removed within a year of the album's release. The words to this poem appear on a plaque at the Hospital where Boyd died.\n\n\n&quot;American Pie&quot; \n&quot;Till Tomorrow&quot; \n&quot;Vincent (Starry, Starry Night)&quot; \n&quot;Crossroads&quot; \n&quot;Winterwood&quot; \n&quot;Empty Chairs&quot; \n&quot;Everybody Loves Me, Baby&quot; \n&quot;Sister Fatima&quot; \n&quot;The Grave&quot; \n&quot;Babylon&quot; (Traditional) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43c59855b1320c776114c2fb2987bfe1f27da46f","amp;dn":"don+mclean...American+Pie%281971%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43c59855b1320c776114c2fb2987bfe1f27da46f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,197,152,85,177,50,12,119,97,20,194,251,41,135,191,225,242,125,164,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
