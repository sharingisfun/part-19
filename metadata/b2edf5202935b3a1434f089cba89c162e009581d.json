Considers exotic forms of life that would not have to rely on carbon as the basic chemical element, solar energy as the main energy source, or water as the primary solvent and the question of detecting bio- and geosignatures of such life forms, ranging from earth environments to deep space. Seeks an operational definition of life and investigate the realm of possibilities that nature offers to realize this very special state of matter. Avoids scientific jargon wherever possible to make this intrinsically interdisciplinary subject understandable to a broad range of readers.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 268 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 2nd edition (November 17, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 3540768165\n# ISBN-13: 978-3540768166","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2edf5202935b3a1434f089cba89c162e009581d","amp;dn":"Life+in+the+Universe+-+Expectations+and+Constraints%2C2nd+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2edf5202935b3a1434f089cba89c162e009581d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,237,245,32,41,53,179,161,67,79,8,156,186,137,193,98,224,9,88,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
