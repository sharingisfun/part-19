But tampering with time and paradox can have disastrous effects on the future and the past alike, breeding a violent new strain of fundamentalist terror - and, worse still, encouraging brilliant rebels like Dr. Gertrude Salley to toy with the working mechanisms of natural law, no matter what the consequences. And when they concern the largest, most savage creatures that ever walked the Earth, the consequences may be too horrifying to imagine.\r\n\r\nRead by Kevin Pariseau\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1426fffdf9e4665d107327f01f795e24f5af45c1","amp;dn":"Michael+Swanwick+-+Bones+of+the+Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1426fffdf9e4665d107327f01f795e24f5af45c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,38,255,253,249,228,102,93,16,115,39,240,31,121,94,36,245,175,69,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
