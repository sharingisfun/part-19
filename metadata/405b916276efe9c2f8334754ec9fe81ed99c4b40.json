Godzilla, the only hatchling to survive in the original movie, imprints on Nick and provides the &quot;muscle&quot; against the other monsters encountered by the human characters, much in the spirit of the Japanese ShÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½wa era films and the Hanna-Barbera cartoon.&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_the_series\n\nThere is no official release of this entire series on home video so if you like the series please continue seeding so that other fans can download as well.
