These exchanges ultimately gave way to meet-ups for intensive recording sessions, and in 2012 the stew of ideas and recording sketches materialized into Thumpers. The two honed their catchy and hook-heavy pop recordings, eventually catching the ear of Sub Pop, which planned to release the band's debut album in 2014. Though mostly working just as a duo, Pepperell and Hamson teamed with producer David Kosten for some songs on their debut and extended the live version of the band to include an often rotating cast of players. In 2013 Thumpers played shows opening for Chvrches and Everything Everything, and eventually set out on their own headlining tours.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37124eecd115515225f81d63ff56d7921efaa2e6","amp;dn":"Thumpers+-+Galore+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37124eecd115515225f81d63ff56d7921efaa2e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,18,78,236,209,21,81,82,37,248,29,99,255,86,215,146,30,250,162,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
