Mary responded to both these calls. At first, she was interested in a posting to the WomenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s Hospital in Calcutta. Due to both demographic and cultural reasons Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ women having many babies and taboos against male doctors touching them Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ a couple of years in Calcutta would have given Mary obstetrical experience the equivalent of several yearsÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ practice in England. This appointment, however, was made only every third year and she had a year to kill. Years later, when asked by an interviewer whether her parents were not alarmed at her decision to take a posting to the Canadian frontier, Mary reminded her that she had been planning on going to India.\nHer decision to go north, rather than south, came as the result of an advertisement in February 1929, carried in the British Medical Journal. It was, in effect, sending out a call for Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºNew Women.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ The job offered was Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºcountry work in Western Canada.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ \n\nDr. Jackson has repeatedly said that one of the things prompting her to apply for an interview was the fact that the ability to ride a horse was listed as a distinct advantage. At the time of her application she was working as Casualty House Surgeon at the Birmingham ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s Hospital and had taken up riding in the park as her only exercise on her half-day off. She thought she was becoming quite good at it. After seven years of hard study, she was eager for more air and fewer people. She also loved mountains and, upon checking an atlas to find that the Rockies were on AlbertaÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s western border, was even more interested. All in all, it seemed to offer the double attraction of service and adventure. Both of these promises would be borne out. Her adventures were many and within months of her arrival, she wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºI wouldnÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´t come back to England for 1,000 dollars just now! ... I know IÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´m doing the right job.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹\n- From the Introduction to the First Edition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de4625b45a1718416b5017473736e71885148008","amp;dn":"Letters+from+Northern+Alberta+%281929-1931%29+%282006%29+%28338p%29+%5BInua%5D.p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de4625b45a1718416b5017473736e71885148008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,70,37,180,90,23,24,65,107,80,23,71,55,54,231,24,133,20,128,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
