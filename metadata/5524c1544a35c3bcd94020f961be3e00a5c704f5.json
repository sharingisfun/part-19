William Mudge's Ordnance Survey\r\nThe first edition of the Ordnance Survey was the product of the most complete mapping study of Britain since the Tudors. For the first time, there were maps linking county to county, based on a scale of one inch to the mile. The end of the 18th century was a bad time for Britain. The American colonies had just been lost. Napoleon's forces were sweeping across Europe and the French fleet was on standby to attack Britain. Under threat of invasion, the army said the country had to be mapped to see where the French were likely to invade. In 1791, a 29-year-old lieutenant, William Mudge, was put in charge of this epic mapping survey. After the initial surveying of Kent and Essex to protect the capital, the survey quickly moved to Devon, where the British fleet at Plymouth was at risk. \r\n\r\nCan Nick reproduce the triangulation methods of Mudge's original survey, particularly across the dangerous wilderness of Dartmoor?\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3700Kbps)\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 29 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 808 MB\r\nSource: HDTV (upscaled)\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5524c1544a35c3bcd94020f961be3e00a5c704f5","amp;dn":"Map.Man.Series2.6of8.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5524c1544a35c3bcd94020f961be3e00a5c704f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,36,193,84,74,53,195,188,217,64,32,249,97,190,62,0,165,199,4,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
