The band takes their name from the slogan &quot;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight,&quot; coined to express the expansionist agenda of James K. Polk's presidency, intent upon controlling a contested U.S.-Canada border area.\n\nThe group formed in 1981 as a trio consisting of Brad Merritt (bass), Darryl Neudorf (drums), and Neil Osborne (Vocals). In 1984, Phil Comparelli was added on guitar and Vocals, and Neudorf was replaced by Matt Johnson. The band announced in March 2005 that Comparelli had officially passed on guitar duties to Dave Genn, formerly of Matthew Good Band. Musician Dave Osborne (keyboards, harmonica), toured and recorded with the band from 1987 to 1993.\n\nThe band's self-titled second album, released in 1986, began to attract attention from radio and record buyers across Canada, with the single &quot;Baby Ran&quot; gaining significant radio airplay. The band's third album, Show Me, became their commercial breakthrough in Canada, with the hits &quot;One Gun&quot; and &quot;One Day in Your Life&quot;.\n\nAlthough the band were popular on college radio in the United States, they never had a commercial breakthrough -- 1992's Dear Dear was their first album not to have a U.S. release. It was, however, their best-selling album in Canada, leading to a new U.S. contract for the follow up, Smilin' Buddha Cabaret, which had a significant hit in &quot;Ocean Pearl&quot;.\n\nThe band's song &quot;I Go Blind&quot; was covered in the mid-1990s by American band Hootie &amp; the Blowfish.\n\n\nSweeter Things: A Compilation is a 1991 compilation album by 54ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢40. It was their final release for Warner-Reprise, and compiled tracks from their albums 54ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢40, Show Me and Fight for Love. The title track from 1984's 'Set The Fire' as well as two unreleased tracks, &quot;Sweeter Things&quot; and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, are also included.\n\nThe band subsequently moved to Columbia Records for its next studio project, 1992's Dear Dear.\n\nFULL ALBUM @ 320kbps\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe72567d309fdc5ea5ef089f448693519f72ab06","amp;dn":"54-40+-+Sweeter+Things+-+A+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe72567d309fdc5ea5ef089f448693519f72ab06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,114,86,125,48,159,220,94,165,239,8,159,68,134,147,81,159,114,171,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
