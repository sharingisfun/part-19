The record was the end of the line for the band at the time. After the very successful Brothers and Sisters two years previously, the group had fallen prey to internal tensions. Dickey Betts (continuing to be billed as Richard Betts for this album) had seemingly taken over from Gregg Allman as the de facto bandleader, while both had issued solo albums.\n\nDue to being tied to the West Coast, much of Allman's vocals and instrumentation were recorded at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California, with the vocals and instrumentation of the rest being recorded at Capricorn Studios in Macon, Georgia. Additionally, drummers Butch Trucks and Jaimoe went missing from &quot;Louisiana Lou and Three Card Monty John&quot; and the Billy Joe Shaver cover &quot;Sweet Mama (Lay Your Burdens Down)&quot;, replaced with producer Johnny Sandlin (who had drummed in the pre-Allman Brothers Band group The Hour Glass) and occasional road drummer Bill Stewart.\n\nIn any case, there were a few modest highlights on Win, Lose or Draw: the dynamic Muddy Waters cover &quot;Can't Lose What You Never Had&quot;, sung strongly by Allman with start-stop mini-false endings; the long, fluid Betts instrumental &quot;High Falls&quot;; and the title track, which reflected Allman's Jackson Browne-influenced[citation needed] work from his Laid Back solo album. But in general, reviews of the album were negative, commenting on a lack of energy, formulaic songwriting, and indifferent sound.\n\nThe album reached #5 on the Billboard 200 albums chart based on their previous popularity. The record had been highly anticipated a year earlier, but now the Allmans' moment was passing. Long ethereal jams were out of vogue; by autumn 1975 other trends were in the air, from Bruce Springsteen's high-energy Jersey dramas to Patti Smith's intense proto-punk poetry, with punk rock and disco just around the corner. The Allman Brothers would dissolve in acrimony the following year, and a late 1970s reunion attempt notwithstanding, would not reclaim their spot in the American musical pantheon until their successful 1989 reformation.\n\nThe album cover depicts the Old West interior decor of Muhlenbrinks Saloon in Underground Atlanta. A poker table topped with half-empty whiskey bottles, playing cards and poker chips is in view. Six chairs representing the present members of the band surround the table. The influence of the band's deceased members, Duane Allman and Berry Oakley, is in the room. Just behind the larger table, two empty chairs lean against a small unused table.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Can't Lose What You Never Had&quot; (Muddy Waters) - 5:49\n    &quot;Just Another Love Song&quot; (Richard Betts) - 2:44\n    &quot;Nevertheless&quot; (Gregg Allman) - 3:32\n    &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; (Gregg Allman) - 4:45\n    &quot;Louisiana Lou and Three Card Monty John&quot; (Richard Betts) - 3:45\n    &quot;High Falls&quot; (Richard Betts) - 14:28\n    &quot;Sweet Mama&quot; (Billy Joe Shaver) - 3:32\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Gregg Allman Ã¢â‚¬â€ lead vocals, organ, clavinet and acoustic guitar\n    Richard Betts Ã¢â‚¬â€ lead guitar, slide guitar, lead vocals and acoustic guitar\n    Jaimoe Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums and percussion\n    Chuck Leavell Ã¢â‚¬â€ piano, electric piano\n    Butch Trucks Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums, congas, percussion and tympani\n    Lamar Williams Ã¢â‚¬â€ electric bass\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b19cf10f21997ecc0fe7dafdae8e3f46e479406","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+Band+-+Win+Lose+Or+Draw+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b19cf10f21997ecc0fe7dafdae8e3f46e479406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,25,207,16,242,25,151,236,192,254,125,175,218,232,227,244,110,71,148,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
