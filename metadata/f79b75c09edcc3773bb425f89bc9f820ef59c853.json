It was recorded in September 2008 during the Rock the Cosmos Tour at Freedom Square in Kharkiv, Ukraine and was released on June 15, 2009.\n\nJust weeks ahead of the start of the Rock the Cosmos Tour the band were approached to help UkraineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Elena Pinchuk AntiAids Foundation reach out to the youth of the country with this message: Ã¢â‚¬ËœDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let AIDS Ruin Your LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe venue they played was KharkivÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historic Freedom Square, a place so big that during World War II it was used to land planes. For the band and crew it meant Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everyone had to run very fast, very suddenly, but then most of the great and worthwhile things in your life are a little dangerous.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOver 350,000 Ukrainians came to see them play and more than 10,000,000 (by conservatives estimates) homes watched the show live on television. In all, more than 20,000,000 took part in what the band recall as Ã¢â‚¬Å“an unforgettable experienceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ one of those rare things in life you know you will never forget. A meeting in music, but also a coming together to fight a common enemyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTrack Listing [256k MP3] [Sorry Not My RIP]\n\nDisc 1\n\n    &quot;One Vision&quot; (Deacon, May, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor) - 4:03\n    &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; (May) - 2:29\n    &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; (Deacon, May, Mercury, Taylor) - 4:37\n    &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; (May) - 5:00\n    &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; (Deacon) - 3:35\n    &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; (May) - 3:42\n    &quot;I Want It All&quot; (Deacon, May, Mercury, Taylor) - 4:10\n    &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot; (Deacon) - 3:55\n    &quot;Seagull&quot; (Paul Rodgers, Mick Ralphs) - 4:50\n    &quot;Love of My Life&quot; (Mercury) - 5:45\n        Lead vocals by May.\n    &quot;'39&quot; (May) - 4:37\n        Lead vocals by May.\n    &quot;Drum Solo&quot; (Taylor) - 5:00\n    &quot;I'm in Love with My Car&quot; (Taylor) - 3:42\n        Lead vocals by Taylor.\n    &quot;Say It's Not True&quot; (Taylor) - 4:02\n        Lead vocals by Taylor, May &amp; Rodgers.\n\nDisc 2\n\n    &quot;Shooting Star&quot; (Rodgers) - 6:21\n    &quot;Bad Company&quot; (Simon Kirke, Rodgers) - 5:36\n    &quot;Guitar Solo&quot; (May) - 3:58\n    &quot;Bijou&quot; (Queen) - 2:07\n        Lead vocals by Mercury (via tape)\n    &quot;Last Horizon&quot; (May) - 4:32\n    &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; (Mercury) - 4:04\n    &quot;C-lebrity&quot; (Taylor) - 3:52\n    &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot; (Rodgers, Ralphs) - 6:45\n    &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (Mercury) - 5:53\n        Pre-recorded vocals by Mercury, with lead vocals by Rodgers.\n    &quot;Cosmos Rockin'&quot; (Taylor) - 4:28\n    &quot;All Right Now&quot; (Andy Fraser, Rodgers) - 5:31\n    &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (May) - 2:19\n    &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; (Mercury) - 2:59\n    &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (Traditional, arr.
