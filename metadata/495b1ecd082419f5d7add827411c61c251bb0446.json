They travel to Spain where the Professor is kidnapped, and the mystery deepens.\n\nReview (from The Pocket Essential Tintin):\nSecond live-action film, based on an original story. The casting does not work as well as in the previous film: Talbot (as Tintin) is starting to look his age and Bouise (as Haddock) is not as good as Wilson. On the other hand, Jenny OrlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ans is a great Castafiore. The direction is not quite as dynamic and the story skews too young. 2/5.\n\nRunning time: 1 hr 32 m; French language with English subtitles.\n(DVD rip; torrent includes sample screenshot.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:495b1ecd082419f5d7add827411c61c251bb0446","amp;dn":"Tintin+and+the+Blue+Oranges+%281964%29+%28Eng+Sub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"495b1ecd082419f5d7add827411c61c251bb0446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,91,30,205,8,36,25,245,215,173,216,39,65,28,97,194,81,187,4,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
