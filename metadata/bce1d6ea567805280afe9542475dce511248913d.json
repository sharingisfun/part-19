He was influenced by songwriters Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt. Crowell played guitar and sang for three years in Emmylou Harris' &quot;Hot Band&quot;.\n\nCrowell was born August 7, 1950,in Crosby, Texas, to James Walter Crowell and Addie Cauzette Willoughby.{Chinaberry Sidewalks (New York: Knopf, 2011} He had come from a musical family, with one grandfather being a church choir leader and the other a bluegrass banjo player. His grandmother played guitar and his father sang semi-professionally at bars and honky tonks.[1] At age 11, he starting playing drums in his father's band. In his teen years, he played in various garage rock bands in Houston, performing hits of the day mixed with a few country numbers.\n\n \nIn August 1972 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in search of a musical career and got a job as a songwriter after being discovered by Jerry Reed.[1] He later met and befriended fellow songwriter Guy Clark, who became a major influence on his songwriting and vice versa.[2][3] While there, he said, &quot;I got a real cold splash in the face of what real songwriting is about. I started filling my mind with as many symbols and images as I could. I started reading. I got real hungry to have something to contribute&quot;.[2] Emmylou Harris had recorded some of Crowell's songs and made a request to meet him. After he visited Emmylou's home in Washington, D.C., she asked him to play rhythm guitar in her backing band, The Hot Band. He accepted and later followed her to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1977 as a side project, he formed a musical group, The Cherry Bombs, together with Vince Gill, Tony Brown and others.[5] One year later, he signed a solo deal with Warner Bros. Records and in late 1978, released his debut album, Ain't Living Long Like This.\n\nHis debut album, as well his following two albums, But What Will the Neighbors Think and Rodney Crowell, were not commercially successful despite garnering a huge cult following. Crowell himself criticized his debut album for not translating onto vinyl the same clarity and energy he felt in the studio. His single &quot;Ashes by Now&quot; from &quot;But What Will the Neighbors Think&quot; reached #37 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1981.\n\nThough he had already several country hits by artists covering his songs (including &quot;Ain't Living Long Like This&quot; by Waylon Jennings, &quot;Leaving Louisiana...&quot; by the Oak Ridge Boys, and several covers by Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, Emmylou Harris, Jerry Reed and others), Crowell got his first big taste of pop songwriting success with &quot;Shame on the Moon&quot;. &quot;Shame on the Moon&quot; was recorded on the 1982 album &quot;The Distance&quot; by Bob Seger &amp; the Silver Bullet Band. Glenn Frey joined Seger on background harmony on the song. Appealing to a broad cross-section of listeners, the song spent four weeks at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart, topped the adult contemporary chart, and placed in the Top 15 of the country chart in early 1983. The song's dark, poetic and hypnotic style helped boost Crowell's cult status.\n\nThe album Rodney Crowell was released in 1981 (see 1981 in country music) by Warner Bros. Records and was his last album on that label before switching to Columbia. The first album Crowell produced by himself, it reached #47 on the Top Country Albums chart and #105 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The songs &quot;Stars on the Water&quot; and &quot;Victim or a Fool&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Stars on the Water&quot; reached #30 on the Hot Country Songs chart, Crowell's highest charting song up to that point. It peaked at #21 on the Canadian country charts. &quot;Victim or a Fool&quot; reached #34 in the U.S.\n\nIn 1981, Rodney left Warner Bros.' roster, putting his career on hold to produce several of his wife Rosanne Cash's albums.[2]\n\nIn 1983 Crystal Gayle had a number one Country single with his song &quot;'Til I Gain Control Again&quot; from her first Elektra album, &quot;True Love&quot;. The song was first recorded in 1975 by Emmylou Harris.\n\nAfter producing Rosanne Cash's Rhythm &amp; Romance, Crowell signed to Columbia Records in 1986. His first album for that label, Street Language, was co-produced with Booker T. Jones and featured a blend of Soul and country music.[6] The album did not chart.\n\nAlthough best known as a songwriter and alternative country artist, Crowell enjoyed mainstream popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s. His critically acclaimed album 1988's Diamonds &amp; Dirt produced five consecutive No. 1 singles during a 17-month span in 1988 and 1989: &quot;It's Such a Small World&quot; (a duet with Cash), &quot;I Couldn't Leave You If I Tried,&quot; &quot;She's Crazy For Leavin',&quot; &quot;After All This Time&quot; and &quot;Above and Beyond&quot; (a cover of Buck Owens' 1962 hit). His follow-up album, 1989's Keys to the Highway, produced two top 5 hits in 1990, which were &quot;Many a Long and Lonesome Highway&quot; and &quot;If Looks Could Kill.&quot;\n\nAs Crowell's popularity in hit-radio country music faded, he continued his prolific songwriting. After 1992's Life Is Messy, he left Columbia Records and signed to MCA Records where he released two more albums.\n\nIn 2001, after a brief hiatus from recording, he released The Houston Kid on Sugar Hill Records, his first studio album since 1995's Jewel of the South. Many songs on the album were semi-autobiographical, and the album included a duet with Crowell's ex father-in-law Johnny Cash on &quot;I Walk the Line (Revisited)&quot;. Initially, Cash was annoyed at Crowell for changing the tune to his song, but he came to like the finished product.[citation needed] Crowell followed up this effort with Fate's Right Hand in 2003 and The Outsider in 2005, both of which came out on Columbia Nashville, a division of Sony Music. Leading critics and Crowell consider these three albums his finest work as a solo artist.\n\n2004 saw the release of The Notorious Cherry Bombs, a reunion of Crowell's 1970s road band, including Vince Gill and Tony Brown. The future Keith Urban hit &quot;Making Memories of Us&quot; was included on this disc. In 2005, Crowell served as producer for established Irish singer/songwriter Kieran Goss on the album &quot;Blue Sky Sunrise&quot;.\n\nIn 2008 CMT announced that Crowell's next album, Sex and Gasoline, would come out on Yep Roc Records, ending his relationship with Sony Music. This marked the first time Crowell did not produce his own CD, turning production over to Joe Henry. The album was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album.[7] Crowell figures prominently in musician-neuroscientist Daniel Levitin's book The World in Six Songs for which he was interviewed, and three Crowell songs, &quot;Shame On The Moon,&quot; &quot;I Know Love Is All I Need&quot; and &quot;I Walk the Line (Revisited)&quot; are featured in the book.\n\nIn 2009, Crowell wrote Wynonna Judd's title track to her album Sing: Chapter 1, which also was released in 2009. The song was given several electronic dance music remixes, and sent to dance radio as Judd's second release from the album. In August 2009, the single reached #4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.\n\nIn 2010, Chely Wright will release her seventh studio album\n\nHe was married to Rosanne Cash (daughter of Johnny Cash), from 1979 to 1992 and they had an influence on each other's careers, with Rodney producing most of her albums during that period and her success influencing his songwriting. They collaborated on a number of duets, including 1988's &quot;It's Such a Small World.&quot; Although Crowell and Cash are now divorced, they remain on friendly terms, performing together occasionally. Crowell and Cash have three daughters, Caitlin, Chelsea, and Carrie, and together raised Hannah, Rodney's daughter from a previous marriage. He married Claudia Church in 1998. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAin't Living Long Like This 1978 \n\nAin't Living Long Like This is the title of the first album of American country music artist Rodney Crowell. It was released in 1978 (see 1978 in country music) by Warner Bros. Records. It failed to enter the Top Country Albums chart. The songs, &quot;Elvira&quot;, &quot;Baby Better Start Turnin' 'Em Down&quot; and &quot;(Now and Then, There's) A Fool Such as I&quot; were released as singles but they all failed to chart within the top 40. Despite this, Ain't Living Long Like This is considered one Crowell's best and most influential albums. Brett Hartenbach of Allmusic says it &quot;not only showcases his songwriting prowess, but also his ability to deliver a song, whether it's one of his own or the work of another writer&quot;.[2] Most of the songs on this album were later covered by other artists including The Oak Ridge Boys and Alan Jackson.[citation needed] When the album was re-released in 2002 the font on the cover was enlarged to make it more legible.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Elvira&quot; (Dallas Frazier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n2.\t&quot;(Now and Then, There's) A Fool Such as I&quot; (Bill Trader) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n3.\t&quot;Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight&quot; (Donivan Cowart, Rodney Crowell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n4.\t&quot;VoilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡, An American Dream&quot; (Crowell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n5.\t&quot;I Ain't Living Long Like This&quot; (Crowell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04\n6.\t&quot;Baby, Better Start Turnin' 'Em Down&quot; (Crowell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n7.\t&quot;Song for the Life&quot; (Crowell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n8.\t&quot;I Thought I Heard You Callin' My Name&quot; (Lee Emerson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n9.\t&quot;California Earthquake (A Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On)&quot; (Crowell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut What Will The Neighbors Think 1980\n\nBut What Will the Neighbors Think is the title of the second studio album by American country music artist Rodney Crowell. It was released in 1980 (see 1980 in country music) by Warner Bros. Records. It reached #64 on the Top Country Albums chart and #155 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The songs, &quot;Ashes by Now&quot;, &quot;Ain't No Money&quot; and &quot;Here Come the 80's&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Ashes by Now&quot; only reached #78 on the country charts and #37 on the Billboard Hot 100 while the other two singles failed to chart. This album has more of a rock &amp; roll influence than Crowell's debut, Ain't Living Long Like This. The album was rereleased on compact disc in 2005.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Here Come the 80's&quot; - 4:14\n2.\t&quot;Ain't No Money&quot; - 4:01\n3.\t&quot;Oh What a Feeling&quot; (Keith Sykes) - 3:00\n4.\t&quot;It's Only Rock &amp; Roll&quot; - 3:22\n5.\t&quot;On a Real Good Night&quot; - 3:55\n6.\t&quot;Ashes by Now&quot; - 4:11\n7.\t&quot;Heartbroke&quot; (Guy Clark) - 3:36\n8.\t&quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; (Hank DeVito) - 3:37\n9.\t&quot;Blues in the Daytime&quot; - 4:21\n10.\t&quot;The One About England&quot; - 3:39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodney Crowell 1981\n\nRodney Crowell is the title of the third, eponymous studio album by American country music artist Rodney Crowell.

In addition, all five of its singles reached Number One on the Billboard country charts, setting a record for the most Number One hits from a country album. In order of release, these were &quot;It's Such a Small World&quot; (a duet with then-wife Rosanne Cash), &quot;I Couldn't Leave You If I Tried&quot;, &quot;She's Crazy for Leaving&quot;, &quot;After All This Time&quot;, and a cover of Buck Owens' &quot;Above and Beyond (The Call of Love)&quot;.

The track &quot;I Don't Have to Crawl&quot;, dating from 1980, was newly included on this album.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Ashes by Now&quot; (Rodney Crowell) - 4:09\n2.\t&quot;'Til I Gain Control Again&quot; (Crowell) - 5:07\n3.\t&quot;VoilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡, An American Dream&quot; (Crowell) - 3:49\n4.\t&quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; (Hank DeVito) - 3:39\n5.\t&quot;Shame on the Moon&quot; (Crowell) - 4:35\n6.\t&quot;Old Pipeliner&quot; (Tommy Hill, Ray King) - 2:59\n7.\t&quot;Stars on the Water&quot; (Crowell) - 3:42\n8.\t&quot;Heartbroke&quot; (Guy Clark) - 3:33\n9.\t&quot;I Don't Have to Crawl&quot; (Crowell) - 3:59\n10.\t&quot;Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight&quot; (Donivan Cowart, Rodney Crowell) - 3:24\n11.\t&quot;Victim or a Fool&quot; (Crowell) - 2:57\n12.\t&quot;I Ain't Living Long Like This&quot; (Crowell) - 4:50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Is Messy 1992\n\nLife Is Messy is the title of the seventh studio album released by American country music artist, Rodney Crowell.

Many famous musicians contributed instruments or vocals to this album such as Linda Ronstadt, Don Henley, Booker T. Jones and Steve Winwood. &quot;The Answer Is Yes&quot; was covered by Michelle Wright on her 1996 album For Me It's You, while &quot;Lovin' All Night&quot; was covered by Patty Loveless on her 2003 album On Your Way Home.
