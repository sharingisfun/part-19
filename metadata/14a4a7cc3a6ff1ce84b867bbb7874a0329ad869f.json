Despite the notoriety surrounding Lewis's financial coups, little has been written about the life of this remarkable man. \n\nBased on Lewis's unfinished autobiography, as well as scores of interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, the book cuts through the myth and media hype to reveal the man behind the legend. What emerges is a vivid portrait of a proud, fiercely determined individual with a razor-sharp tongue Ã¢â‚¬â€ and an intellect to match Ã¢â‚¬â€ who would settle for nothing less than excellence from himself and others.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Memoir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14a4a7cc3a6ff1ce84b867bbb7874a0329ad869f","amp;dn":"Why+Should+White+Guys+Have+All+the+Fun%3F+by+Reginald+F.+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14a4a7cc3a6ff1ce84b867bbb7874a0329ad869f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,164,167,204,58,111,241,206,132,184,103,187,183,135,74,3,41,173,134,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
