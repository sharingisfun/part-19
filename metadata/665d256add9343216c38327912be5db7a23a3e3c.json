Disc One's first four tracks actually date back to 1944, when Monk made his first Prestige appearance as a sideman for Coleman Hawkins. From here the timeline jumps to sessions from '52-'53 that feature Monk in various ensemble configurations including quartets, quintets, and trios.\n\nTop-drawer players--including bassist Percy Heath, tenor man Sonny Rollins, and drummers Max Roach and Art Blakey--appear on these dates, with the bold push-and-pull between Monk and Rollins making the biggest impression. Disc Three focuses on the one session that ever found Monk and trumpet legend Miles Davis sharing a studio (due to personal and aesthetic differences the two subsequently steered clear of each other), with excellent and sensitive playing all around. At three discs, The Complete Prestige Recordings might seem skimpy compared to other &quot;complete&quot; sets, but the size makes the listening quite manageable, and the caliber of the playing is consistently high throughout.\n\n\nCD 1\n01 - Flyin' Hawk - 2:51\n02 - Recollections - 2:56\n03 - Drifting On A Reed - 3:06\n04 - On The Bean - 2:43\n05 - Bye-Ya - 2:47\n06 - Monk's Dream - 3:07\n07 - Sweet And Lovely - 3:36\n08 - Little Rootie Tootie - 3:07\n09 - Bemsha Swing - 3:12\n10 - Reflections - 2:49\n11 - These Foolish Things - 2:49\n12 - Trinkle, Tinkle - 2:51\n13 - Think Of One (Take 1) - 5:41\n14 - Let's Call This - 5:08\n15 - Think Of One (Take 2) - 5:47\n16 - Friday The 13th - 10:36\n\n\nCD 2\n01 - We See - 5:18\n02 - Locomotive - 6:24\n03 - Smoke Gets In Your Eyes - 4:33\n04 - Hackensack - 5:13\n05 - Nutty - 5:19\n06 - Just A Gigolo - 3:03\n07 - Work - 5:19\n08 - Blue Monk - 7:39\n09 - I Want To Be Happy - 7:46\n10 - The Way You Look Tonight - 5:15\n11 - More Than You Know - 10:53\n\nCD 3\n01 - Bags' Groove (Take 1) - 11:11\n02 - Bemsha Swing - 9:34\n03 - The Man I Love (Take 1) - 8:32\n04 - Swing Spring - 10:46\n05 - Bags' Groove (Take 2) - 9:19\n06 - The Man I Love (Take 2) - 7:57\n\n\n\nPersonnel includes:\nThelonious Monk (piano); Coleman Hawkins, Sonny Rollins, Frank Foster (tenor saxophone); Miles Davis, Ray Copeland (trumpet);Julius Watkins (French horn); Milt Jackson (vibraphone); Gary Mapp, Tommy Potter, Edward &quot;Bass&quot; Robinson, Curly Russell (bass); Arthur Taylor, Denzil Best, Kenny Clarke, Willie Jones, Max Roach (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:665d256add9343216c38327912be5db7a23a3e3c","amp;dn":"Thelonious+Monk+The+Complete+Prestige+Recordings%283CD%29%28jazz%29%28mp3%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"665d256add9343216c38327912be5db7a23a3e3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,93,37,106,221,147,67,33,108,56,50,121,18,190,93,183,162,58,62,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
