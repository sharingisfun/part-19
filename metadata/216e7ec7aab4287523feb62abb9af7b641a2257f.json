Sutton (Weird Ideas that Work), a professor of management science at Stanford University, argues that assholesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½those who deliberately make co-workers feel bad about themselves and who focus their aggression on the less powerfulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½poison the work environment, decrease productivity, induce qualified employees to quit and therefore are detrimental to businesses, regardless of their individual effectiveness. He also makes the solution plain: they have to go. Direct and punchy, Sutton uses accessible language and a bevy of examples to make his case, providing tests to determine if you are an asshole (and if so, advice for how to self-correct), a how-to guide to surviving environments where assholes freely roam and a carefully calibrated measure, the &quot;Total Cost of Assholes,&quot; by which corporations can assess the damage. Although occasionally campy and glib, Sutton's work is sure to generate discussions at watercoolers around the country and deserves influence in corporate hiring and firing strategies. \nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It could be the notorious bad boss or the jealous coworker, but everyone agrees that they make life miserable for their victims and create a hostile and emotionally stifling environment. Fed up with how these creeps treat others and poison the workplace, Sutton declares war and comes out calling them exactly what they are--&quot;certified assholes.&quot; Caricatured in sitcoms such as The Office, these brutes are too often tolerated until irreparable damage is done to individuals and the organization as a whole. Sutton's &quot;no asshole rule&quot; puts a stop to the abuse in no uncertain terms. Similar rules have transformed such companies as JetBlue, the Men's Wearhouse, and Google into shining examples of workplaces where positive self-esteem creates a more productive, motivated, and satisfied workforce. If you have ever been a victim, just reading Sutton's analysis brings calm relief, empowerment, and reassurance that you're not alone.
