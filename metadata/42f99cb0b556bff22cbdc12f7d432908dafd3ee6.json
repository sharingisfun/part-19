Visiting Tehran, Shiraz, Persepolis, and a small village, we'll get a rare present-day look at of some of civilization's most important historical sites, and a sense of Iran's 21st-century culture. From architecture and art to faith and everyday living, &quot;Iran, Yesterday and Today&quot; offers a rare, candid, and humanizing look at a great if perplexing nation.&quot;\n\n\n\nmore info: http://www.ricksteves.com/tvr/tvr_menu.htm\n\n\n\n==\n\nRuntime: 55:52\n\nSource: OTA High Definition 1080i\n\nVideo Encoding: xvid.1280x720.3829kbps\n\nAudio Encoding: ac3.384kbps-5.1chan\n\nFile Size: 1.65GB\n\n\n\nSupport your local PBS Station by making a contribution or by purchasing their DVDs.
