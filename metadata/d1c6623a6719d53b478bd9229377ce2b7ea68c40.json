He was the son of Tim Buckley, also a musician. Buckley gained popularity in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village, such as Sin-ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, and he gradually focused more on his own material. After much interest from record labels he signed with Columbia and, after recruiting a band, recorded what would be his first and only studio album, Grace.\nOver the following two years, the band toured widely to promote the album, including concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Australia. In 1997, he stopped touring and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to experiment with new material for a second album, recording many four-track demos and completing his third recording session for his new album with his band, with Tom Verlaine as producer. While awaiting the arrival of his band from New York, he drowned during an evening swim in the Wolf River. His body was found on June 4, 1997.\nSince his death, there have been many posthumous releases of his material, including a collection of four-track demos and studio recordings for his unfinished second album My Sweetheart the Drunk and expansions of debut album Grace and his Live at Sin-ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© EP. Chart success also came posthumously; with &quot;Hallelujah&quot; he attained his first #1 on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs in March 2008 and reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart at Christmas 2008. Buckley and his work continue to remain popular and regularly featured in 'greatest' lists in the music press.\n\n\nLyrics:\nWell I heard there was a secret chord\nThat David played, and it pleased the Lord\nBut you don't really care for music, do ya?\nWell it goes like this\nThe fourth, the fifth\nThe minor fall and the major lift\nThe baffled king composing Hallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\n\nWell Your faith was strong but you needed proof\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\nHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew you\nshe tied you to her kitchen chair\nAnd she broke your throne and she cut your hair\nAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\n\nWell baby I've been here before\nI've seen this room and I've walked this floor\nI used to live alone before I knew ya\nI've seen your flag on the marble arch\nLove is not a victory march\nIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\n\nWell there was a time when you let me know\nWhat's really going on below\nBut now you never show that to me do you?\nAnd remember when I moved in you?\nAnd the holy dove was moving too\nAnd every breath we drew was Hallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\n\nWell maybe there's a God above\nBut all I've ever learned from love\nWas how to shoot somebody who'd OUT DREW YA\nAnd it's not a cry that you hear at night\nIt's not somebody who's seen the light\nIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\n\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\n\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah &lt;&lt;(held for a long time)\nHallelujah\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1c6623a6719d53b478bd9229377ce2b7ea68c40","amp;dn":"Jeff+Buckley+-+Hallelujah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1c6623a6719d53b478bd9229377ce2b7ea68c40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,198,98,58,103,25,213,59,71,139,217,34,147,119,206,43,126,166,140,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
