If you hate Jar-Jar, Anakin's cringeworthy dialogue, the useless trip through the planet core etc. this is the one for you.\n\nIt was downloaded fromtaking time and effort and seeded by me taking even more time and effort. Please seed and share. \n\n\nl8twrtr's intro:\n\nOriginal film name\tSTAR WARS: EPISODE I ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ THE PHANTOM MENACE\nFilm studio name\tLucasfilm\nFilm release date\t1999\nOriginal runtime\t136 minutes\nFanedit release date\tJuly 2010\nNew runtime\t        96 minutes\nTime cut/added\t\t41 min cut / 1 min added\n\nINTENTION:\nAs is the case for many fans of Star Wars, the Phantom Edit went a long way toward rescuing the original Phantom Menace for me, and for quite some time it was my new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“definitiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ version of the film, yet I could never escape the fact that I felt that Phantom Editor Mike Nichols did not go nearly far enough or cut deep enough from the original. Once I made the decision to start making fanedits of my own it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t long before I came to the conclusion that my first effort needed to be Episode I. Like every faneditor of this film it is my goal to create the most watchable, most enjoyable, and most ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Star WarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ like version of Episode I as possible.\n\nEDITING DETAILS &amp; CUTLIST:\n\nWith the edit I set out to accomplish three goals:\n- Drastically improve the many flawed characters as much as possible.\n- Drastically improve the overall tone and pacing of the film\n- Restructure the narrative so that Anakin Skywalker is the true hero of the film.\n\nThis edit also benefits from the wonderful color work of Adywan who was so kind as to give his blessing for me to use his color corrected The Phantom Menace Theatrical Edition. Almost all footage of this edit uses AdyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s color corrected footage, while the Deleted Scenes and a few short sequences that do not appear in the theatrical cut were taken from a standard DVD release and color corrected by myself, or with the assistance of Hebrides.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:054424d9e7010e684e1d08abd169adebe230511b","amp;dn":"Shadow+of+the+Sith+%28Star+Wars+Ep1+The+Phantom+Menace+-+Fan+Edit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"054424d9e7010e684e1d08abd169adebe230511b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,68,36,217,231,1,14,104,78,29,8,171,209,105,173,235,226,48,81,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
