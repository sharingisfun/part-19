Based on Jo Pagano's novel The Condemned, the film recreates a dismal chapter in American history. In 1933, the otherwise peace-loving citizens of San Jose, CA, were stirred up by blind hatred into forming a mob and lynching two accused kidnappers (this same incident was fictionalized in the 1935 Fritz Lang film Fury). Frank Lovejoy and Lloyd Bridges play a couple of down-and-outers who kidnap a wealthy youngster in hopes of getting a huge ransom. Things go terribly wrong, and the boy is killed. When the two kidnappers are arrested, a local journalist (Richard Carlson) inflames the populace with a series of hate-filled articles about the two prisoners. The journalist then stands by in mute horror as he watches the terrible results of his irresponsible print campaign.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043075/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043075/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3560176/the-sound-of-fury-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3560176/the-sound-of-fury-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:28:10\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 656x496  4/3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1460 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,18 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee62c07c5bb612562c7aeba4c32bd7ef414a5324","amp;dn":"The+Sound+of+Fury+%281950%29+Frank+Lovejoy+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee62c07c5bb612562c7aeba4c32bd7ef414a5324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,98,192,124,91,182,18,86,44,122,235,164,195,43,215,239,65,74,83,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
