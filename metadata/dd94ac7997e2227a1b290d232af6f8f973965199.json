Ali Mansoori et al. (Springer, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book takes a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, beginning with atoms and molecules â€“ molecular building blocks â€“ and assembling them to build nanostructured materials. Coverage includes Carbon Nanotubes, Nanowires, and Diamondoids. The applications presented here will enable practitioners to design and build nanometer-scale systems. These concepts have far-reaching implications: from mechanical to chemical processes, from electronic components to ultra-fine sensors, from medicine to energy, and from pharmaceuticals to agriculture and food","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd94ac7997e2227a1b290d232af6f8f973965199","amp;dn":"Molecular+Building+Blocks+for+Nanotechnology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd94ac7997e2227a1b290d232af6f8f973965199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,148,172,121,151,226,34,122,27,41,13,35,42,246,248,249,115,150,81,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
