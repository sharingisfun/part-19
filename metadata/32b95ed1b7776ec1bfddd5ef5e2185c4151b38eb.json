Per their request, having seen so many positive changes in the men in their lives, The New Eve is an equally stirring counterpart to RobertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teachings on authentic biblical manhood, powerfully defining Christian womanhood in the context of the modern world. \nHe says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Many women lack a clear, compelling, biblical vision for what it means to be a Christian woman living in the twenty-first century. They are stuck with images mired in 1950s terminology or given license to indiscriminately pursue a modern life that overlooks divine directives, bringing confusion and regret.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nIn essence, The New Eve sets forth and expounds upon five Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bold MovesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discerning woman: Live from the Inside Out; Adopt a Biblical Definition of Womanhood; Embrace a Big-Picture Perspective on Life; Live with the End in Mind; Use Wisdom with a Man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32b95ed1b7776ec1bfddd5ef5e2185c4151b38eb","amp;dn":"The+New+Eve+by+Robert+Lewis%2C+Jeremy+Howard%2C+Shaunti+Feldhahn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32b95ed1b7776ec1bfddd5ef5e2185c4151b38eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,185,94,209,183,119,110,193,191,221,213,239,94,33,133,196,21,27,56,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
