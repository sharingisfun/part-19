Together, individually and in duets and trios (accompanied by the skillful but always sensitive Del McCoury on guitar) this remarkable crew plays a generous program of bluegrass standards and originals. The album opens awkwardly, with a woozy, down-tempo ensemble performance of Bill Monroe's classic, &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky,&quot; but things pick up quickly; there are outstanding performances of &quot;I'm Going Back to Old Kentucky&quot; (courtesy of Sam and Del) and of Frank Wakefield's unusual &quot;One-Legged Man&quot; as well as Ricky Skaggs' rip-roaring take on &quot;Boston Boy,&quot; a seven-second version of &quot;Rawhide&quot; and lots of amusing between-take patter. A must for bluegrass fans.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33df3aca38f420e3981d477ca479b86c68abde60","amp;dn":"VA+-+Bluegrass+Mandolin+Extravaganza+%28HDCD+to+24+bit%29+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33df3aca38f420e3981d477ca479b86c68abde60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,223,58,202,56,244,32,227,152,29,71,124,164,121,184,108,104,171,222,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
