Focusing on European travelers in India and their analysis of Hindu society, politics and religion, it also offers a detailed and systematic study of the variety of travel narratives describing South India from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries. In addition, the book proposes a novel approach to the study of European attitudes toward non-Europeans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c357358ce2e1c684dcdefaeb1555f0b5021a219b","amp;dn":"Travel+and+Ethnology+in+the+Renaissance+-+South+India+through+Eu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c357358ce2e1c684dcdefaeb1555f0b5021a219b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,87,53,140,226,225,198,132,220,222,250,235,21,85,240,181,2,26,33,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
