And it does; even the occasional clunky lyric comes directly from her overflowing heart. Laundry Service's meld of danceable pop and rockier ideas and textures follows the similar path of the singer-songwriter's previous work. Indeed, for all its high-end production values, the record is ultimately one of the least glossy crossover vehicles imaginable. Despite an occasional lean toward Celine Dion territory (&quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;), it has a freshness that's sure to win over new listeners even after the first single, the sly &quot;Whenever, Wherever,&quot; has reached the saturation point. While still not fully formed as an artist, she's getting close to something of her own--something that may flower after she dumps the vocal Alanis-isms. For now, it's still a pleasure to watch her grow. \n\nWikipedia - Laundry Service is the debut English breakthrough studio album by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, released on November 13, 2001 by Epic Records. All the songs on the album except Eyes Like Yours (which is a translation of ShakiraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trademark Ojos AsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­) are original and were fully or partly composed by Shakira. It also contains four songs in Spanish. Shakira recorded this album during almost two years in Uruguay and the Bahamas.\nThe album reached the top three of the charts in both the United States and United Kingdom (after the re-release, it reached #2 in UK). Whenever, Wherever (and its Spanish counterpart Suerte), the first single from the album, was first heard in Colombia and the United States in late August 2001 and immediately became number one. Subsequently, the single was climbing the tops of charts in more than 30 countries during the period of over 6 months, eventually becoming the best selling single of 2002 worldwide. Shakira started the promotion in Colombia and Spain in October 2001 and then returned to the US for the American album release (November 13, 2001). There are also another three international singles Underneath Your Clothes (U.S. #9), Objection (Tango) and The One, that finally helped to recognize Shakira as a mainstream artist. Freddy DeMann, who worked with Michael Jackson, Madonna and Alanis Morissette, handled the management of that era of ShakiraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career and the promotion. For the first time she appeared in a number of American prime-time TV shows and open-air concerts and continued the promotion in Europe, South America and Asia up to July 2002. Shakira supported the album with the &quot;Tour of the Mongoose&quot; with the worldwide audience of over 1.2 million people. Laundry Service is Shakira's best selling album to date and has sold more than 13 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a Latin American artist ever.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Objection (Tango)\n[02] Underneath Your Clothes\n[03] Whenever, Wherever\n[04] Rules\n[05] The One\n[06] Ready For The Good Times\n[07] Fool\n[08] Te Dejo Madrid\n[09] Poem To A Horse\n[10] Que Me Quedes Tu\n[11] Eyes Like Yours\n[12] Suerte (Whenever, Wherever)\n[13] Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t---&gt; 00h:49m:14s\nTotal File Size\t\t---&gt; 132mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\nTotal Bit Size\t\t---&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t\t---&gt; I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 Mp3 Format\nMusic video Format \t---&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t\t---&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t\t---&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t\t---&gt; Pop\nOriginally Released\t---&gt; 13 November 2001\nRecord Company\t\t---&gt; Epic Sony Music\nArtist Website\t\t\n\n---&gt; http://www.shakira.com \n---&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakira \n---&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/s/shakira.html\n---&gt; http://twitter.com/shakira \n---&gt; http://www.bebo.com/officialshakira \n---&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/shakira\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5336eb4fe5cb7897d279f7d86ab96c2e7839205","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Laundry+Service+-+Shakira+132mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5336eb4fe5cb7897d279f7d86ab96c2e7839205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,51,110,180,254,92,183,137,125,39,159,125,134,171,150,194,231,131,146,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
