Countless apps have been developed both by us internally as well as by our user base and shared with both Maple and non-Maple users through deployment tools like MapleNet. Seven years ago we launched the Step by Step Integration Tutor with Maple 10. Release after release we then introduced hundreds of applications, interactive assistants, tutors, and task templates. Starting today you will find over one hundred additional interactive Math Apps in Maple 16, providing insight into concepts from mathematics, physics, science, finance and engineering.\n\nwww.maplesoft.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ab6c13cf1d08176c466dad71646dd2ea09c405","amp;dn":"Maplesoft+Maple+16.0+32Bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ab6c13cf1d08176c466dad71646dd2ea09c405","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,171,108,19,207,29,8,23,108,70,109,173,113,100,109,210,234,9,196,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
