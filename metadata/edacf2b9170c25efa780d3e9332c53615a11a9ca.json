Since his death in police custody, he has been called a martyr of the anti-apartheid movement.[4] While living, his writings and activism attempted to empower black people, and he was famous for his slogan &quot;black is beautiful&quot;, which he described as meaning: &quot;man, you are okay as you are, begin to look upon yourself as a human being&quot;.[5]\n\nDespite friction between the African National Congress and Biko throughout the 1970s[need quotation to verify] the ANC has included Biko in the pantheon of struggle heroes, going as far as using his image for campaign posters in South Africa's first non-racial elections in 1994.[6]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edacf2b9170c25efa780d3e9332c53615a11a9ca","amp;dn":"Steve+Biko%27s+Writings+-+I+Write+What+I+LIke+%28Cry+Freedom+-+Denze","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edacf2b9170c25efa780d3e9332c53615a11a9ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,172,242,185,23,12,37,239,167,128,211,233,51,44,83,97,90,17,169,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
