Now the seven years are up - but Rachel's devious father substitutes his elder daughter on the wedding night.\n\nMatthew Modine and Lara Flynn Boyle play Jacob and Rachel in one of the greatest love stories from the Bible. Highlights of Jacob's life - how he usurped his brother Esau's birthright and blessing, the pillow of stone, the ladder to heaven, wrestling with God - are set against the heartache and hope of his relationship with the woman he seems destined never to possess. Sustained by his faith in God and his love for Rachel, Jacob perseveres... and becomes the father of the 12 tribes of Israel. Also starring Sean Bean, Irene Papas and Giancarlo Giannini. Color/93 minutes. Closed captioned. Not rated.\nBy\nJerry Parks &quot;USAToday All-American Teacher; N... (Lexington, KY USA) - See all my reviews\n\nCast into a pit by his jealous brothers, young Joseph pleads for mercy. Instead, the brothers sell the terrified boy into slavery in Egypt. But Joseph turns this agonizing betrayal into triumph.\n\nAcademy Award Ã‚Â® winners Ben Kingsley and Martin Landau highlight an outstanding cast in this beloved Biblical tale of treachery and redemption. Joseph uses his gift for divining dreams to rise from slave to Pharaoh's most trusted aide, saving Egypt from seven years of famine. Then his brothers travel to Egypt in search of food... and right into Joseph's power. &quot;Forgiveness is greater than vengeance,&quot; Joseph declares. &quot;Compassion more powerful than anger.&quot; But can he forgive so grievous a wrong? Also starring Paul Mercurio and Lesley Ann Warren. Color/187 minutes. Closed captioned. Not rated.  \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.
