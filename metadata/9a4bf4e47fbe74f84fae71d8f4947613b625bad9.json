The family relocates to the countryside where his father is assigned to take command a prison camp. A few days later, Bruno befriends another youth, strangely dressed in striped pajamas, named Shmuel who lives behind an electrified fence. Bruno will soon find out that he is not permitted to befriend his new friend as he is a Jew, and that the neighboring yard is actually a prison camp for Jews awaiting extermination.\n\n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\n\nPlease do not hit and run....seed so others may enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a4bf4e47fbe74f84fae71d8f4947613b625bad9","amp;dn":"The+Boy+In+The+Striped+Pajamas+%282008%29+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a4bf4e47fbe74f84fae71d8f4947613b625bad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,75,244,228,127,190,116,248,79,174,113,216,244,148,118,19,182,37,186,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
