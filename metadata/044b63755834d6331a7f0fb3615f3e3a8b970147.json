MGM, however, adhered to the policy that all movies must have plots. This one finds Lanza playing Pepe Abellard Duvalle, a shrimp fisherman from Louisiana's bayou country, while Grayson plays Suzette Micheline, a famed opera singer. After he witnesses an impromptu duet between Pepe and Suzette at an outdoor restaurant, Suzette's manager Jacques Riboudeaux (David Niven) decides to groom Pepe for singing stardom. In so doing, Jacques has put the kibosh on his own romance with Suzette, but that's why he gets third billing. Toast of New Orleans is a typical Joe Pasternak production, all bright smiles, lilting songs and happy people in Living Technicolor. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043053/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043053/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPort subs\n\n\nDirector:\nNorman Taurog\n\n\n\tKathryn Grayson\t... \tSuzette Micheline\n\tMario Lanza\t... \tPepe Abellard Duvalle\n\n\tDavid Niven\t... \tJacques Riboudeaux\n\tJ.
