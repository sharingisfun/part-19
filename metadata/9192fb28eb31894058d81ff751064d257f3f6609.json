They recruited drummer Daniel Bergkvist and the mighty Wolf was born. Their self titled debut album, with cover artwork from legendary Swedish horror artist Hans Arnold, saw the light of day in 2000, got great reviews, the video went on rotation &amp; Wolf set out to tour, play high profile festivals, bang their heads, drink beer etc.Sounds like Livin the Dream.\n01. Overture In C Shark\n02. Shark Attack\n03. Skeleton Woman\n04. Surgeons Of Lobotomy\n05. My Demon\n06. I Am Pain\n07. Back From The Grave\n08. The Dark Passenger\n09. River Everlost\n10. Frozen\n11. Killing Floor\n\nWolf live and breathe Heavy Metal at their live shows - energy, volume, Flying V guitars and a &quot;never stand still&quot;-policy give every metal-fan what they desire. In 2004, Wolf decide its time to go back to the studio, again with Peter TÃƒÂ¤gtgren (Hypocrisy, Destruction, Immortal) as producer to record their groundbreaking Evil Star album. Unsurprisingly the trend of great reviews and more live shows followed, gaining the band an ever-growing fanbase within the public, the media and other bands.
