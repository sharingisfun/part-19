Doug Funnie and his family (which consists of his parents Theda and Phil, sister Judy, and dog Porkchop) move from the town of Bloatsburg to Bluffington after his dad receives a job promotion. Bluffington is located in the US, but not in any specific US state. However Bluffington is loosely based on the city of Richmond, Virginia, where creator Jim Jinkins was born and raised. Beyond the title character, Doug featured a large ensemble cast of characters. Many of the series' ancillary characters, among them Ms. Wingo and Mr. Spitz, are based on authority figures from Jinkins' childhood.\r\n\r\n[TECHNICAL DETAILS]\r\n\r\nSource: iTunes Webrip\r\n\r\nFile Container: MKV\r\nVideo Format: h.265/HEVC\r\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\r\n\r\nAudio Type: Stereo\r\nTrack 1: English\r\nAudio Format: AAC\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101084/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f087760a08750a16fea14954cd473560783c0fb3","amp;dn":"Doug+%28Nickelodeon+Seasons+1-4%29+%5B480p%5D+%5BWEBRIP%5D+%5BHEVC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f087760a08750a16fea14954cd473560783c0fb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,135,118,10,8,117,10,22,254,161,73,84,205,71,53,96,120,60,15,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
