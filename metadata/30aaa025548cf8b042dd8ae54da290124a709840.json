Orfeu de Conceicao is the most famous samba player in Brazil, and one of the most respected members of the neighborhood of Carioca Hill, a labyrinth of dirty streets and quickly made shacks ruthlessly controlled by drug lord Lucinho. Young Orfeu, though, lives a gilded life. He has his pick of a bevy of local beauties, children worship him, and the corrupt police will not harass him like the others in the area. During the run-up to Carnival, his world is turned upside down with the appearance of the gorgeous Euridice, who has just moved from the remote untamed hinterland of the Amazon. In spite of her indifference to samba music and her initial reluctance, the two soon fall passionately in love. Unfortunately, the violence of their surroundings threatens to overwhelm them. When Lucinho takes a liking to Euridice and challenges his former childhood friend, Orfeu is forced to endure a brutal test for his love. Orfeu was screened at the 1999 Toronto Film Festival.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Orfeu.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 1748 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 7.12 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Portugues\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 1521 Kbps\n      Width : 688 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.239\n      StreamSize : 1.19 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 223 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 178 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0183613\n\nPortuguese audio, English subpack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30aaa025548cf8b042dd8ae54da290124a709840","amp;dn":"Orfeu+%281999%29+-+Carlos+Diegues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30aaa025548cf8b042dd8ae54da290124a709840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,170,160,37,84,140,248,176,66,221,138,229,77,162,144,18,74,112,152,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
