There will be unseen footage from the BBC One show, chat about the latest baking shenanigans and an interview with the latest baker to leave.\nJo and her guests will celebrate pastry in the An Extra Slice studio, tasting audience bakes and looking at viewer photos of their home bakes - from tantalising tarts to pitiful pastries. They will also be putting the remaining bakers and their bakes under the microscope. Whose frangipane tart was a work of art in this week's signature? What will the panel think of the flaounas in the technical, and have they even heard of them? And whose vol-au-vents will impress in the showstopper?\n\nThe Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice.
