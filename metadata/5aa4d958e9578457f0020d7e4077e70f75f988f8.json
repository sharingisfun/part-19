Cotton storms through classics like &quot;Off the Wall,&quot; &quot;Don't Start Me to Talkin',&quot; &quot;Sweet Sixteen,&quot; and the title cut. The tracks are literally swimming in reverb, but the band blows hard and heavy; for a budget set, you could do a lot worse.\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n1. Off the Wall\n2. Don't Start Me Talkin'\n3. Dealing With the Devil\n4. The Creeper\n5. You Know It Ain't Right\n6. Feelin' Good\n7. Knock on Wood\n8. Sweet Sixteen\n9. I Need You So Bad\n10. 'fore Day Creep\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aa4d958e9578457f0020d7e4077e70f75f988f8","amp;dn":"James+Cotton+-+%5B1994%5D+Feelin%27+Good+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aa4d958e9578457f0020d7e4077e70f75f988f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,164,217,88,233,87,132,87,240,2,13,126,64,119,231,15,117,249,136,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
