We   did  not  implement  any off-the-shelf\n   algorithm. Toraverb is not a  classic type reverb unit like  spring,  room,\n   hall  or  plate.  Toraverb  is   a  concept  algorithm reverb. Using  a set\n   of easily accessible  parameters, it allows the user to create  practically\n   ANY type  of reverb.                                              \n   \n   Our goal   was to   create a   reverb which   would sound  pleasant  to the\n   listener and  the output   could be tweaked in  many different ways by  the\n   user.          \n   \n   Critical effect in any studio                        \n   \n   Reverb is a critical  effect in a mix.  Final results depend on the  reverb\n   algorithm used and the  quality of the  implementation. Usually  reverb  is\n   used as a send  effect  in which   many  channels in  a  mix are routed  to\n   it.  If  a low   quality plug-in  or  hardware  unit  is   used,  the   end\n   results  can   sound   very  disappointing with  the  reverb  tail sounding\n   like it had been ripped-off in the mix.                    \n   \n   High quality of diffusion                            \n   \n   In  Toraverb, we   applied diffusing  algorithms  of  the highest  possible\n   quality  based on modified  all-pass filters.  By  doing  this  and   using\n   properly  tuned  parameters,  we  can  almost  entirely  eliminate unwanted\n   flutter echo effects for every sound source.         \n   \n   Separate equalisation for early and late reflections \n   \n   Toraverb   is   equipped  with    two   independent,  single  band,   fully\n   parametric equalisers. One  is used to   EQ early   reflections   and   the\n   other   to  EQ   late reflections.  This  is an  incredibly  useful feature\n   which allows a lot   of control over the   character of the reverb  to give\n   the most natural sound.           \n   \n   Modulated tail                                       \n   \n   Toraverb also has an  additional modulation  parameter which   affects  the\n   diffusing  filters.  These   are  responsible for the  distribution  of the\n   sound waves reflections in time. By changing the modulation,  the sound  of\n   the reverb  tail can  be altered  to give a more realistic effect of  sound\n   propagation.          \n   \n   Spatial reflections                                  \n   \n   To  give   a better   impression  of  physical  space,   we have  added  an\n   innovative  spatial  reflection  algorithm  to   Toraverb.   It    improves\n   spatial   reflections  by  allowing  cross-talking   of  reflected   stereo\n   waves between stereo channels. This models what happens  in the real  world\n   when a sound  audible only in  the  left ear  is reflected and  is heard in\n   both ears.          \n   \n   Conslusion                                           \n   \n   Toraverb  is  a  very  versatile  reverb  unit.  The high  sound  quality,\n   flexible  sound shaping  capabilities and  ease of use will be  appreciated\n   by every producer  and sound  engineer.
