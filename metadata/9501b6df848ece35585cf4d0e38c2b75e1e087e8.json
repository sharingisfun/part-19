This greatest-hits collection documents the band's ambitious beginnings as a funky glam-rock outfit and follows its gradual transformation into a high-tech pop band with loads of commercial appeal. Featuring now-classic tunes like &quot;Girls on Film,&quot; &quot;Rio,&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot; as well as more recent songs like &quot;Ordinary World,&quot; Greatest focuses on Duran Duran's unending string of hit singles. Although the young quintet that performs &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; has little in common with the posh, aging trio featured on 1997's &quot;Electric Barbarella,&quot; vocalist Simon Le Bon provides some impressive continuity to these proceedings.\n\n    Planet Earth\n    Girls On Film (Uncensored)\n    The Chauffeur (Uncensored)\n    Hungry Like The Wolf\n    Save A Prayer\n    Rio\n    Is There Something I Should Know?\n    Union Of The Snake\n    New Moon On Monday\n    The Reflex\n    The Wild Boys (Extended Version)\n    A View To A Kill\n    Notorious\n    Skin Trade\n    I Don't Want Your Love\n    All She Wants Is\n    Serious\n    Burning The Ground\n    Ordinary World\n    Come Undone\n    Electric Barbarella\n\nVideo info: XviD - 344x248 - 29.97fps - 1h 40mn 23s 585ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9501b6df848ece35585cf4d0e38c2b75e1e087e8","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+Greatest+Hits+%5B1998%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9501b6df848ece35585cf4d0e38c2b75e1e087e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,1,182,223,132,142,206,53,88,92,244,208,227,140,43,117,225,224,135,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
