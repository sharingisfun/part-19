In particular\nthe man must be protective of family unit and women and children most of all\nif he is to be almost as &quot;god on earth&quot; to many in whatever manner\n\nIts a fun movie and I quite enjoyed seeing it myself - Michael Piccolo's\ncharacter in the movie is still one of a greatest man - far above the\ncaliber of the multicultural misfits we are shown as playing on the team too -\nas hopeful equals someday no doubt.\n\nNow if only they would nay the hitting of little girls by even little boys -\neven in such apparently minor skirmishes as shown in the movie for discussion -\nit is an anathema for the best of men that must be emphatically driven home\nfor all concerned (the subject is only touched on in this movie). The gals of\nItaly such as the gal shown are the most precious a gift from God and must\nbe treated dearly and with all the cure we can muster instead - god forbid\nwe do otherwise in this way!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21be4d720904252eba0ab7614430c52233756beb","amp;dn":"Habemus+Papam+%28We+have+a+Pope%29+720p+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21be4d720904252eba0ab7614430c52233756beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,190,77,114,9,4,37,46,186,10,183,97,68,48,197,34,51,117,107,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
