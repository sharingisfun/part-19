Many local colonists have been killed by Native Americans, who are armed with rifles supplied by white traders. Local adventurer and real-life figure James Smith, along with his followers, complain to British officials, pressuring them to make it illegal to trade weapons to the Indians. Trader Ralph Callender and other businessmen are not happy with the new law as it cuts into their profit.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, released as The First Rebel, the film was initially banned by the Ministry of Information for placing the British, already at war against Nazi Germany, in a bad light.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 688x512, 25.000 fps, 1470 Kbps, 01h20m34s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\nRatio: 4:3\r\n\r\nVHSRip colourized, DUAL Audio Tracks English and Spanish\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles: Czech, Dutch, English, Greek, Italian, Polish\r\n                    Portuguese-Brazil, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/rxp39aq35/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/4hxhicc7b/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/b9nwl716v/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/9vw9pw1xj/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/4yip4rzyf/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e9d4dc915c56880b07d325a135f8b966c216941","amp;dn":"Allegheny+Uprising+%5B1939+-+USA%5D+%28John+Wayne%29+colourized+western","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e9d4dc915c56880b07d325a135f8b966c216941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,157,77,201,21,197,104,128,176,125,50,90,19,95,139,150,108,33,105,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
