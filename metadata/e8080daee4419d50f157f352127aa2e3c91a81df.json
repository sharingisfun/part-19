However, I had always avoided Lyle Lovett for some unknown reason. Maybe it was the whole Julia Roberts thing. But let me tell you...this is one of the best albums I have heard in my entire life. Live In Texas captures so many elements of music on one live CD. It flows from happy-go-lucky, swinging numbers to slower, pensive peeks into the mind of Lovett. Partiicularly amazing are the songs Nobody Knows Me and If I Had A Boat. These two songs will remind you of those lonely nights where you sat alone at your computer, looking for some form of entertainment since your life at the present time has none. Lovett's voice is so passionate that it could move a grown man to tears. If you are in the least bit curious about Lyle Lovett and his Large Band, then you must check out this CD. This is the CD to startb your Lyle Lovett collection with. And trust me, like Lays potato chips, you can't stop with just one.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     Lyle Lovett - Live in Texas\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Lyle Lovett\nAlbum................: Live in Texas\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1999\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
