But what can we do? Actually, we can just say Ã¢â‚¬Å“no.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As New York Times bestselling author Thomas E. Woods, Jr., explains, Ã¢â‚¬Å“nullificationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ allows states to reject unconstitutional federal laws. For many tea partiers nationwide, nullification is rapidly becoming the only way to stop an over-reaching government drunk on power. From privacy to national healthcare, Woods shows how this growing and popular movement is sweeping across America and empowering states to take action against ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s socialist policies and big-government agenda.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nThomas E.
