Focusing especially on Christianity but including Judaism, Islam,  :\n : Buddhism, Hinduism, and Chinese spiritualities, Armstrong examines the     :\n : diminished impulse toward religion in our own time, when a significant     :\n : number of people either want nothing to do with God or question the        :\n : efficacy of faith. Why has God become unbelievable? Why is it that atheists:\n : and theists alike now think and speak about God in a way that veers so     :\n : profoundly from the thinking of our ancestors?                             :\n :                                                                            :\n : Answering these questions with the same depth of knowledge and profound    :\n : insight that have marked all her acclaimed books, Armstrong makes clear how:\n : the changing face of the world has necessarily changed the importance of   :\n : religion at both the societal and the individual level. Yet she cautions us:\n : that religion was never supposed to provide answers that lie within the    :\n : competence of human reason; that, she says, is the role of logos. The task :\n : of religion is &quot;to help us live creatively, peacefully, and even joyously  :\n : with realities for which there are no easy explanations.&quot; She emphasizes,  :\n : too, that religion will not work automatically. It is, she says, a         :\n : practical discipline: its insights are derived not from abstract           :\n : speculation but from &quot;dedicated intellectual endeavor&quot; and a &quot;compassionate:\n : lifestyle that enables us to break out of the prism of selfhood.&quot;          :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:232f086092a24355d18f5257066d1c8e984b8296","amp;dn":"Karen+Armstrong+The+Case+for+God+2009+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"232f086092a24355d18f5257066d1c8e984b8296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,47,8,96,146,162,67,85,209,143,82,87,6,109,28,142,152,75,130,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
