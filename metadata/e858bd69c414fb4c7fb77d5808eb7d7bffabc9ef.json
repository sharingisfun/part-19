It still has appeal.\n\nThe commentary is civilized and intelligent, the pictures are well chosen, and the classification of artists into various schools is sensibly conventional, with occasional apologetics for the choice, often with a sketch of the history of a school of painting.\n\nThe pictures themselves are large, attractive, and a pleasure to view.\n\nThe commentary is written in normal prose, free of artistic jargon. This book is not another manifestation of an &quot;expert&quot; conspiracy against the laity.\n\nIf you think, as I do, that the second half of the twentieth century was pretty much expendable from an artistic standpoint, then this is pretty much the perfect book on American painting.\n\nJBoy at Amazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e858bd69c414fb4c7fb77d5808eb7d7bffabc9ef","amp;dn":"Three+hundred+years+of+American+painting+%28Time-Life+Art+Ebook%29.p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e858bd69c414fb4c7fb77d5808eb7d7bffabc9ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,88,189,105,196,20,251,76,127,183,125,88,8,235,125,123,255,171,201,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
