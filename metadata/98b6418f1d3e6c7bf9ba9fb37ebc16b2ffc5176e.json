Although the group's members weren't even close to being recognizable, and their in-house songwriting was next to irrelevant, the Grass Roots managed to chart 14 Top 40 hits, including seven gold singles and one platinum single, and two had hits collections that effortlessly went gold. The group's history is also fairly complicated, because there were at least three different groups involved in the making of the songs identified as being by &quot;the Grass Roots.&quot;\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kifoxqe5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kifoxqe5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlbum Review\nby Bruce Eder\n\nIt may be expensive, and two CDs of their work may seem like overkill, but this double-disc set is the one to get. Not only does it contain every hit and each single, and every B-side, from 1965's &quot;Where Were You When I Needed You&quot; through 1975's glorious &quot;Mamacita,&quot; but the sound is extraordinary, far better than on any of the other hits compilations, and provides several revelations about the quality of their work. Highlights, in addition to the expected hits (&quot;Let's Live for Today,&quot; &quot;Midnight Confessions,&quot; &quot;Two Divided by Love&quot; etc.) include tracks like &quot;Is It Any Wonder,&quot; with a chorus as radiant as anything the Mamas and the Papas ever recorded, and the seldom heard, vibrant &quot;Mamacita.&quot; If you could never imagine listening to 120 minutes of Grass Roots material (this reviewer couldn't, either), this set will make you feel differently. \n\nTrack List: Disc 1:\n\n01.
