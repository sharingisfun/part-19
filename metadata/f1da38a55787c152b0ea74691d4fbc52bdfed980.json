Maybe a shooter? No\nprogramming? Then this is for you. Make your own single or multi-\nplayer games. Yes, with multiplayer support! I made my first game\nin under 30 minutes. Try for yourself. And whats the coolest thing\nabout it? You can make stand-alone executables and share with your\nfriends ;)\n\nEDIT: Further updates are available from the FPS Creator main\n      website, but DON'T update since it will turn your full version\n      into the free one, and WON'T allow you to build stand-alone\n      executables anymore.\n\n\nHappy &quot;programming&quot; ;D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1da38a55787c152b0ea74691d4fbc52bdfed980","amp;dn":"FPS+Creator+ISO+with+update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1da38a55787c152b0ea74691d4fbc52bdfed980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,218,56,165,87,135,193,82,176,234,116,105,29,79,188,82,189,254,217,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
