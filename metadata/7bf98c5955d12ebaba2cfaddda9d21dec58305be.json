This is not merely a concert video, nor is it, consciously, a short film. It is a visually stunning, aurally exciting piece that twists your head around in wonderful ways.\n\nDon't judge &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; based on whether or not you like the Radiohead that you hear on the radio; nothing could be further from relevant when regarding this film. The concert footage, in conjunction with the searing visual pyrotechnics, brings to light the product of a band of rare quality, skill, and creativeness. Each bandmember is given a moment in the spotlight to show off their individual talents, and the process as a whole is, well, breathtaking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bf98c5955d12ebaba2cfaddda9d21dec58305be","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+Meeting+People+Is+Easy.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bf98c5955d12ebaba2cfaddda9d21dec58305be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,249,140,89,85,209,46,186,186,44,250,221,218,157,33,222,197,131,5,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
