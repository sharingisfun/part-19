It was created by rapper Nas, his manager Steve Stoute, producer Dr. Dre and production team the Trackmasters. The group was composed of East Coast-based rappers Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ and Nature, who served as a replacement for Cormega after he was ousted from the group.\n\nAlthough the group received initial hype and high expectations from fans upon their formation after collectively signing to Dr. Dre's Aftermath label, The Firm's debut album, The Album (1997), generated disappointing sales and generally negative criticism. The album, which featured predominant mafioso rap-themes and production from Dr. Dre and the Trackmasters, was criticized for its mainstream, pop-orientation. Their debut was the group's only release and it subsequently disbanded in 1998 with each member continuing their solo career.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Intro\n[02] Firm Fiasco\n[03] Phone Tap (Intro)\n[04] Phone Tap\n[05] Executive Decision\n[06] Firm Family\n[07] Firm All Stars\n[08] Fuck Somebody Else (Intro)\n[09] Fuck Somebody Else\n[10] Hardcore\n[11] Untouchable\n[12] Five Minutes To Flush (Intro)\n[13] Five Minutes To Flush\n[14] Desperados (Intro)\n[15] Desperados\n[16] Firm Biz\n[17] I'm Leaving\n[18] Throw Your Guns\n \n\nTotal Play Time \t\t- 00h:52m:55s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 127 mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size \t\t- 320 kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v7.6.2.9 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Hip Hop\n\nRelease Date\t\t- 21 October 1997\n\nRecord Company \t\t- Columbia Sony Music\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fee860f99573bb84b951f7a428465f1bfb7ddff5","amp;dn":"%5B1997%5D+The+Album+-+The+Firm+-+127mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fee860f99573bb84b951f7a428465f1bfb7ddff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,232,96,249,149,115,187,132,185,81,247,164,40,70,95,27,251,125,223,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
