I tried 4 times and it always failed. So I just saved the log report for those tracks ripped. \nI then decided to try and only rip track 16 and it worked perfect and I saved a log report for that. \nAll I can do is claim that these FLAC will play on your flac player but you might not be able to make a cd. So If there is a smarter person out there then they might be able to create a Flac to Cd using the info from the logs.\n\n\n=======================================================\n\nSTYX - The Best Of Times (The Best Of) [1997] [only1joe] FLAC-EAC\n\nThe British collection The Best of Times: The Best of Styx is a flawed but adequate overview of Styx's biggest hits. Most of the group's best-known songs are here, but they're sequenced out of order, and a few new songs, plus a re-recording of &quot;Lady,&quot; are tacked onto the end of the disc..\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] The Best Of Times\n[02] Babe\n[03] Boat On The River\n[04] Mr. Roboto\n[05] Show Me The Way\n[06] Renegade\n[07] Borrowed Time\n[08] Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)\n[09] A.D. 1928\n[10] Rockin' The Paradise\n[11] Sing For The Day\n[12] Too Much Time On My Hands\n[13] Don't Let It End\n[14] Lady '95\n[15] Little Suzie\n[16] It Takes Love\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 01h:05m:52s\nTotal File Size....................... 452mb (Including FLACs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
