The fervent debate, civil strife, and bloody riots within the Christian community as it was forming, however, is a story that is rarely told. Richard E. Rubenstein takes readers to the streets of the Roman Empire during the fourth century, where a divisive argument over the divinity of Jesus Christ was underway. Ruled by a Christian emperor, followers of Jesus no longer feared for the survival of their monotheistic faith, but they found themselves in different campsÃ¢â‚¬â€led by two charismatic menÃ¢â‚¬â€on the topic of Christian theology. Arius, an Alexandrian priest and poet, preached that Jesus, though holy, is less than God, while Athanasius, a brilliant and violent bishop, saw any diminution of Jesus' godhead as the work of the devil. Between them stood Alexander, the powerful Bishop of Alexandria, in search of a solution that would keep the empire united and the Christian faith alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b01a111f4549f46f78900ab6c7de9e470b7054d5","amp;dn":"When+Jesus+Became+God+-+Richard+Rubenstein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b01a111f4549f46f78900ab6c7de9e470b7054d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,26,17,31,69,73,244,111,120,144,10,182,199,222,158,71,11,112,84,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
