Both CD's include 7 tracks with live recordings from the post-Pappalardi era. CD1 was recorded live in New York City 1985, CD2 during the European tour 2003. But both CD's include a hidden Track 8 - not mentioned in the official tracklist. Both tracks (Stormy Monday &amp; Dirty Shoes) were recorded with the classic lineup (West, Pappalardi, Laing, Knight) - most probable at the Olympic Auditorium, Los Angeles, CA on March 7, 1970. maxblues\r\n\r\n\r\nMountain - Eruption\r\nLabel: Snapper Music - SMDCD 515\r\nFormat: 2 Ã— CD, Album\r\nCountry: UK\r\nReleased: 2004\r\nGenre: Rock\r\nStyle: Hard Rock\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nDisc 1 - Live In NYC 1985:\r\n1-1 \tHard Times \t\r\n1-2 \tNever In My Life \t\r\n1-3 \tSpark \t\r\n1-4 \tTheme For An Imaginary Western \t\r\n1-5 \tNantucket Sleighride (To Owen Coffin) \t\r\n1-6 \tMississippi Queen \t\r\n1-7 \tRocky Mountain Way\r\nHidden Bonus Track\r\n1-8\tStormy Monday \r\n\r\nTracks 1-7 recorded April 12, 1985, at L'Amour and June 5, 1985 at The Ritz\r\nLineup: Leslie West (g, v) - Corky laing (d, v) - Mark Clarke (b, v)\r\n\r\nTrack 8 recorded at the Olympic Auditorium, Los Angeles, CA on March 7, 1970 (most probably)\r\nLineup: Leslie West (g, v) - Felix Pappalardi (b) - Corky Laing (d) - Steve Knight (organ)\r\n\r\n\t\r\nDisc 2 - Live In Europe 2003:\r\n2-1 \tWhy Dontcha \t\r\n2-2 \tFor Yasgur's Farm \t\r\n2-3 \tCrossroads \t\r\n2-4 \tThe Sea \t\r\n2-5 \tNantucket Sleighride (To Owen Coffin) \t\r\n2-6 \tHouse Of The Rising Sun \t\r\n2-7 \tDreams Of Milk And Honey\r\nHidden Bonus Track\r\n2-8\tDirty Shoes\r\n\r\nTracks 1-7 recorded during the European Tour 2003\r\nLineup: Leslie West (g, v) - Corky Laing (d, v) - Richie Scarlet (b, v)\r\n\r\nTrack 8 recorded at the Olympic Auditorium, Los Angeles, CA on March 7, 1970 (most probably)\r\nLineup: Leslie West (g, v) - Felix Pappalardi (b) - Corky Laing (d) - Steve Knight (organ)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9662ec89fbc9a7b3d9a38438115e3f8ac5f731e","amp;dn":"Mountain+-+Eruption+%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9662ec89fbc9a7b3d9a38438115e3f8ac5f731e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,102,46,200,159,188,154,123,61,154,56,67,129,21,227,248,172,95,115,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
