The star of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and The Royal Shakespeare Company, Stewart has performed his one-man stage production of A Christmas Carol to sell-out audiences. Now, in this studio recording of the dazzling achievement that has thrilled audiences in New York and Los Angeles, Stewart invites listeners to rediscover the timeless story at its source: Dickens' own, classic words, presented in a soaring, virtuoso solo performance in which Stewart plays all parts. \n\nAudio CD \nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Audio; Abridged edition (November 1, 1992) \nLanguage: English \nISBN-10: 0671793829 \nISBN-13: 978-0671793821  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Carol-Reissue-Charles-Dickens/dp/0671793829/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211003222&amp;sr=8-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Carol-Reissue-Charles-Dickens/dp/0671793829/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211003222&amp;sr=8-3&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c6fc7c48e47e70e69af1e94a565c3f8fcf8793","amp;dn":"Patrick+Stewart+-+A+Christmas+Carol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c6fc7c48e47e70e69af1e94a565c3f8fcf8793","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,198,252,124,72,228,126,112,230,154,241,233,74,86,92,63,143,207,135,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
