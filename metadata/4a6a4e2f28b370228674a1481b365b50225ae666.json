Gregory argues that it is impossible to understand this volatile and pivotal moment in English history without understanding the women at the heart of the family feuds that tore the nobility apart. \n\nShe traces the stories of Elizabeth Woodville - the White Queen - and her rivals, Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville, to demonstrate that they are as vital as any of the Kings and nobles that conventional history concentrates upon. This was a battle between kin not countries and the loyalties, rebellions, plots and betrayals of these women were decisive in shaping the history of England.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a6a4e2f28b370228674a1481b365b50225ae666","amp;dn":"The+Real+White+Queen+++%28BBC+2013+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a6a4e2f28b370228674a1481b365b50225ae666","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,106,78,47,40,179,112,34,134,116,161,72,27,54,91,80,34,90,230,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
