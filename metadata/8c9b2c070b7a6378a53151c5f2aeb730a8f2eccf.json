The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) with Apocrypha (HarperCollins)(one of the best modern translations, widely used by mainline scholars; in the tradition of the KJV)\n\n2. The Authorized King James Version with Apocrypha (Oxford World's Classics) (THE translation in English for centuries, its scholarship is now superseded, but its literary and historical importance is unsurpassed)\n\n3. The Message: Catholic/Ecumenical Edition by Eugene Peterson and William Griffin (NavPress/Acta) (Very popular paraphrase using contemporary casual speech; this new edition is the first that includes the Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical books)\n\n4. The Common English Bible with Apocrypha (The newest complete translation; uneven in quality but at times very good)\n\n\n-----\n\nMany thanks to the original uploaders.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9b2c070b7a6378a53151c5f2aeb730a8f2eccf","amp;dn":"4+Bibles+-+NRSV%2C+CEB%2C+KJV%2C+Message+%28retail+epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9b2c070b7a6378a53151c5f2aeb730a8f2eccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,155,44,7,11,122,99,120,165,49,81,197,242,174,183,48,168,242,236,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
