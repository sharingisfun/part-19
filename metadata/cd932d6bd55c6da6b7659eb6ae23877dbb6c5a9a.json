Timothy Pont's Map of Scotland\r\nCan Nick find a missing mountain pass where the last wolves in Scotland roamed? Timothy Pont graduated from St Andrew's in 1583 and set off to survey Scotland. It was a major undertaking at a time when wolves still roamed the Highlands and it was difficult and dangerous to travel in rival clan territory. Over 18 years he made 77 maps - the first survey of Scotland - with exceptional detail and unsurpassed information. His maps include 350 mountains - some of which still remain to be identified - can Nick track any of them down?\r\n\r\nPont's notes talk about Sutherland as an 'extreme wilderness' with 'many wolves' and 'clouds of black biting flies that souked mens blood.' Quite a place to go map-making!\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3700Kbps)\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 29 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 808 MB\r\nSource: HDTV (upscaled)\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd932d6bd55c6da6b7659eb6ae23877dbb6c5a9a","amp;dn":"Map.Man.Series2.2of8.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd932d6bd55c6da6b7659eb6ae23877dbb6c5a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,147,45,107,213,92,109,166,183,101,158,182,174,35,135,125,187,108,90,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
