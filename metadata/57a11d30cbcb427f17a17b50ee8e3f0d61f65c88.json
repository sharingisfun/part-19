They contributed to the development of progressive rock, and by extension, symphonic rock. Their best-known recording is their 1967 hit single &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, which is considered a classic of popular music and is one of the few singles to have sold over 10 million copies.[1] Although noted for its baroque and classical influence, Procol Harum's music also embraces the blues, R&amp;B and soul.\n\nIn October 2012, the band was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\n&quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, commercial success and debut album (1967)\n\nAt Olympic Studios, with session drummer (and non-Paramount) Bill Eyden, producer Denny Cordell and sound engineer Keith Grant, the group recorded &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, and it was released on 12 May 1967. With a structure reminiscent of Baroque music, a countermelody based on J. S. Bach's Orchestral Suite NÃ‚Â° 3 in D Major by Fisher's Hammond organ, Brooker's soulful vocals and Reid's mysterious lyrics, the single reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and the Canadian RPM Magazine chart. It did almost as well in the United States, reaching No. 5. In Australia, it was No. 1 for many weeks, setting a record of 8 weeks in Melbourne.\n\nAfter &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; became a hit, the band set out to consolidate their studio success by touring; their live debut was opening for Jimi Hendrix in 1967. The group's follow-up single, &quot;Homburg&quot;, with a line-up change of former Paramounts B.J. Wilson on drums and Robin Trower on guitar, reached No. 6 in the UK, No. 15 in Canada, and No. 34 in the US.\n\nThe group's eponymous debut studio album was recorded between the two hit singles, but was held back until early 1968. A series of singles charted lowly in the US and UK, though rarely both at the same time.\n\nThe band's follow-up album, Shine On Brightly, was released the following year and sees a greater excursion into progressive rock stylings. Their third album, A Salty Dog (1969), was popular among fans and their first album to sell well in the UK. The title track in particular gained a good deal of US FM radio airplay. However, one noted US writer previewed the LP and the story ran in print as &quot;A Salty Duck&quot;. Fisher, who produced the album, departed the band soon after its release.\n\nThe group would have many personnel changes, but their line-up for their first three albums was Brooker (piano and lead vocals), Trower (guitar and lead vocals), Fisher (organ and lead vocals), Knights (bass), Wilson (drums), and Reid (lyricist). Former Paramount Chris Copping joined on organ and bass in 1970. The group appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. By 1971, the disparities in style had become too great and, after the release of their fifth album Broken Barricades, Trower left to form his own power trio band and was replaced by Dave Ball. From late 1972 until 1977, the group's guitarist was Mick Grabham. By 1968 their first compilation album In Concert 1968 was released but only in Germany.\n\nProcol Harum returned to success on the record charts in the following years with a symphonic rock sound, often backed by symphony orchestras. At this they were one of the first groups to achieve success; Procol Harum Live: In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra was a No.  5 gold album in the US in 1972, as well as reaching No.  48 in Britain. &quot;Conquistador&quot; (a track from their first album, re-charted for accompaniment by the Edmonton Symphony in 1971) was a hit single in 1972, getting to No.  16 in the US and No.  7 in Canada, whilst reaching No.  22 in the UK. Their follow-up album, Grand Hotel, did fairly well, reaching No.  21 on the US Billboard 200 in 1973. The album also received a Silver Certification (over 60, 000 copies sold) in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1975 Procol Harum played the final night at the Rainbow Theatre in London.[11] More personnel changes contributed to declining sales in the later part of the 1970s, with &quot;Pandora's Box&quot; being their final UK Top 20 hit in 1975. Its parent album, Procol's Ninth saw a reconnection with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller who both produced and wrote with the band. The band broke up in 1977, after seeing Something Magic stall at No.  147 in the US Billboard 200 chart. They reunited for a single performance five months later, when &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; was named joint winner (along with Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;) of the Best British Pop Single 1952Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1977 at the BRIT Awards, part of Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57a11d30cbcb427f17a17b50ee8e3f0d61f65c88","amp;dn":"Procol+Harum+1967-1977+24bit-192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57a11d30cbcb427f17a17b50ee8e3f0d61f65c88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,161,29,48,203,203,66,127,23,161,123,80,238,142,63,13,97,246,92,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
