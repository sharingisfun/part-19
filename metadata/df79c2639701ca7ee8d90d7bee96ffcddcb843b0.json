The publication of a fully revised and updated new edition will be warmly welcomed by this important industry.\r\n\r\nIt is almost ten years since the publication of the second edition of this book. The pace of change witnessed by the food industry over the last decade more than justifies the publication of a fully revised and updated third edition. The increasing importance of safety and quality issues has led to a new chapter on TQM and HACCP. Another significant development in the past ten years has been the demand from consumers for increasingly innovative and nutritionally valuable foods. Manley has extensively revised and expanded the sections on product development and included new material on nutritional issues to enable manufacturers to meet these demands","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df79c2639701ca7ee8d90d7bee96ffcddcb843b0","amp;dn":"Technology+of+Biscuits%2C+Crackers+and+Cookies+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df79c2639701ca7ee8d90d7bee96ffcddcb843b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,121,194,99,151,1,202,126,232,217,13,123,238,150,255,205,220,184,67,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
