Now the Revolutionary Order of the Wicked has vanished, and mysterious Princess Ozma might be Amyâ€™s only ally. As Amy learns the truth about her mission, she realizes that sheâ€™s only just scratched the surface of Ozâ€™s pastâ€”and that Kansas, the home she couldn't wait to leave behind, may also be in danger. In a place where the line between good and evil shifts with just a strong gust of wind, who can Amy trustâ€”and who is really Wicked?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fe54d5a20258ce11eb052852ff0c8d4c0e4ee2","amp;dn":"Danielle+Paige+-+The+Wicked+Will+Rise+%28Dorothy+Must+Die+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fe54d5a20258ce11eb052852ff0c8d4c0e4ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,254,84,213,162,2,88,206,17,235,5,40,82,255,12,141,76,14,78,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
