Their irregular, repeating shapes are found in cloud formations and tree limbs, in stalks of broccoli and craggy mountain ranges, even in the rhythm of the human heart. In this film, NOVA takes viewers on a fascinating quest with a group of maverick mathematicians determined to decipher the rules that govern fractal geometry.\n\nFor centuries, fractal-like irregular shapes were considered beyond the boundaries of mathematical understanding. Now, mathematicians have finally begun mapping this uncharted territory. Their remarkable findings are deepening our understanding of nature and stimulating a new wave of scientific, medical, and artistic innovation stretching from the ecology of the rain forest to fashion design. The documentary highlights a host of filmmakers, fashion designers, physicians, and researchers who are using fractal geometry to innovate and inspire.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1287217/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1287217/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JadneAadn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JadneAadn&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractals&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractals&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nA fractal is \\&quot;a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole,\\&quot; a property called self-similarity. Roots of the idea of fractals go back to the 17th century, while mathematically rigorous treatment of fractals can be traced back to functions studied by Karl Weierstrass, Georg Cantor and Felix Hausdorff a century later in studying functions that were continuous but not differentiable; however, the term fractal was coined by BenoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®t Mandelbrot in 1975 and was derived from the Latin fractus meaning \\&quot;broken\\&quot; or \\&quot;fractured.\\&quot; A mathematical fractal is based on an equation that undergoes iteration, a form of feedback based on recursion.[2] There are several examples of fractals, which are defined as portraying exact self-similarity, quasi self-similarity, or statistical self-similarity. While fractals are a mathematical construct, they are found in nature, which has led to their inclusion in artwork. They are useful in medicine, soil mechanics, seismology, and technical analysis.\n\nCharacteristics\n\n\nA fractal often has the following features:\n\nIt has a fine structure at arbitrarily small scales.\n\nIt is too irregular to be easily described in traditional Euclidean geometric language.\n\nIt is self-similar (at least approximately or stochastically).\n\nIt has a Hausdorff dimension which is greater than its topological dimension (although this requirement is not met by space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve).\n\nIt has a simple and recursive definition.\n\nBecause they appear similar at all levels of magnification, fractals are often considered to be infinitely complex (in informal terms). Natural objects that are approximated by fractals to a degree include clouds, mountain ranges, lightning bolts, coastlines, snow flakes, various vegetables (cauliflower and broccoli), and animal coloration patterns. However, not all self-similar objects are fractalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for example, the real line (a straight Euclidean line) is formally self-similar but fails to have other fractal characteristics; for instance, it is regular enough to be described in Euclidean terms.\n\nImages of fractals can be created using fractal-generating software. Images produced by such software are normally referred to as being fractals even if they do not have the above characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display artifacts which are not characteristics of true fractals.\n\nHistory\n\nThe mathematics behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz considered recursive self-similarity (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the straight line was self-similar in this sense).\n\nIt was not until 1872 that a function appeared whose graph would today be considered fractal, when Karl Weierstrass gave an example of a function with the non-intuitive property of being everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable. In 1904, Helge von Koch, dissatisfied with Weierstrass\\'s abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition of a similar function, which is now called the Koch curve.[5] Waclaw Sierpinski constructed his triangle in 1915 and, one year later, his carpet. The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by Paul Pierre LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vy, who, in his 1938 paper Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole described a new fractal curve, the LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vy C curve. Georg Cantor also gave examples of subsets of the real line with unusual propertiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½these Cantor sets are also now recognized as fractals.\n\nIterated functions in the complex plane were investigated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Henri PoincarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Felix Klein, Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia. Without the aid of modern computer graphics, however, they lacked the means to visualize the beauty of many of the objects that they had discovered.\n\nIn the 1960s, BenoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®t Mandelbrot started investigating self-similarity in papers such as How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension,[6] which built on earlier work by Lewis Fry Richardson. Finally, in 1975 Mandelbrot coined the word \\&quot;fractal\\&quot; to denote an object whose HausdorffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Besicovitch dimension is greater than its topological dimension. He illustrated this mathematical definition with striking computer-constructed visualizations. These images captured the popular imagination; many of them were based on recursion, leading to the popular meaning of the term \\&quot;fractal\\&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93737b2dce5fd0b1ef3c19059723b1ddf8898818","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova+-+Fractals+-+Hunting+the+Hidden+Dimension","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93737b2dce5fd0b1ef3c19059723b1ddf8898818","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,115,123,45,206,95,208,177,239,60,25,5,151,35,177,221,248,137,136,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
