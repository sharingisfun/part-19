On this two-CD set, he shows that the United States' first priority abroad is the free flow of capital. Nothing must hinder corporate efforts to sell weapons and purchase oil -- not trade restrictions, environmental protections, and certainly not human rights. Chomsky shows how the U.S. repeatedly vetoes all efforts at creating international human-rights regulations. A UN-enabling convention on the rights of the child was rejected only by the U.S. and Somalia. But the most interesting part of these speeches are when he discusses America's economic boom of the late '90s and early 2000s. &quot;All the odes to the fairy tale economic boom quite consistently point to the stock market for proof of how great things are,&quot; he says, &quot;and it is great for the people who own stock. One percent of households own about half the stock and most of the rest is owned by the top ten percent. But for most of the population, roughly three-quarters, this is just something to watch, not something you take part in, and you watch it while your own conditions stagnate or decline.&quot; He goes on to describe the boom from the view of the average worker. &quot;Workers are working longer, a month longer than 25 years ago. There is less pay, working conditions are worse, and there is far less security.&quot; The second CD is about U.S. Iraq policy and it covers a lot of familiar ground. Here, Chomsky draws some conclusions that are far-out, including that the U.S. is trying to reduce the population of Iraq, which might benefit oil production in the future. He doesn't attempt to balance any of his information, but the majority of what he has to say is relevant and critical.\n\nNoam Chomsky is an influential linguist, professor, author, and activist. Chomsky has been active in left-wing politics and he opposed the Vietnam War. He is the eighth most cited source of all time, and is considered the ''most cited living author''. Chomsky is also the author of over 150 books.\n\n\nRunning Time: 1:46:42\n\n\n1  Old New World Order\n2  Imf and Bretton Woods\n3  Rule Of Finance Capital\n4  Where Capital Flows\n5  Nixon and Reagan\n6  Fairy Tale Boom\n7  Saintly Alan Greenspan\n8  After Nafta\n9  Rogue State\n10 Universal Rights\n11 Right Of Return\n12 Relativism Triumphant\n13 Torture Chamber\n14 Haitian Refugees\n15 There's No Law\n16 Great Beast\n17 Media Suppression\n18 Threat Of Democracy\n19 Socio-Political Rights\n20 Right To Eat\n21 Properly Educated People\n22 U.S. Prisons\n23 Non-Self-Executing\n24 Just Attack\n25 Favorite Monster\n26 Hard Choice\n27 Meeting in Mosul\n28 Real Threat\n29 Kuwait and Panama\n30 Chemical War\n31 Stability\n32 Religious Conversion\n33 Good Terror\n34 Weapons of Mass Destruction\n35 Carthaginian Solution\n36 It's the Oil\n37 Saddam as Mother Teresa\n38 Sending a Message\n39 War Crimes\n40 Get Lost\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f37f61018686a62601c75cf77d4501adb75e7ec0","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+-+Case+Studies+in+Hypocrisy+U.S.+Human+Rights+Polic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f37f61018686a62601c75cf77d4501adb75e7ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,127,97,1,134,134,166,38,1,199,92,247,125,69,1,173,183,94,126,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
