Michele Stuart vividly remembers standing at her grandmotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s apron hem as a child, as she fine-tuned (and improved!) family recipes that had been passed down for generations. Eventually, StuartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lifelong passion for pie-making inspired her to open what would become the world-famous shop MicheleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pies.\nYou donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to travel to MicheleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pies in Norwalk and Westport, Connecticut, though, to taste StuartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mouthwatering creations. Perfect Pies shares nearly eighty delicious recipes, many of them National Pie Championships winners: There are desserts bursting with fruit (Country Apple Pie, Blueberry-Blackberry Pie), crunchy with nuts (Chocolate-Pecan-Bourbon Pie, Maple Walnut Pie), cream-filled delights (Coconut Custard Pie, Lemon Chiffon Pie), and pies perfect for a party (Ultimate Banana Split Pie, Candyland Pie). And letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not forget StuartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sensational savory creations, from Lobster Pot Pie to Quiche Lorraine to Italian Wheat Pie. Stuart also passes along easy recipes for Hot Fudge Sauce, Raspberry Jam, and Whipped Cream to top it all off.\nStuartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s secret, she says, is that her pies are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmade by hand with love,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t neglect to advise you on the basic kitchen tools youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll need as she reveals essential tips and techniques, from how to roll out dough to the best way to make light and flaky crust. And of course she stresses the use of fresh, seasonal fruits and other wholesome ingredients. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe best pies are the ones that keep it simple,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Stuart notes.
