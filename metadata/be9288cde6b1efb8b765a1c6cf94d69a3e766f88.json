Fortunately, they have          \n   dynamic, innovative models outside U.S. borders. Green Cities of Europe   \n   draws on the world's best examples of sustainability to show how other    \n   cities can become greener and more livable. Timothy Beatley has brought   \n   together leading experts from Paris, Freiburg, Copenhagen, Helsinki,      \n   Venice, Vitoria-Gasteiz, and London to illustrate groundbreaking          \n   practices in urban planning. These cities are creating greenways,         \n   improving public transit, conserving energy, instituting &quot;green audits&quot;   \n   for government, and strengthening their city centers. With Green Cities   \n   of Europe, Beatley offers the U.S. planning community not only a vision   \n   of holistic sustainability, but a clear guide to accomplishing it at      \n   home.                                                                     \n\n  +-[ ALEXANDRIA ]----------------------------------------------------------+\n  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :\n  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :\n  : of the ancient world.
