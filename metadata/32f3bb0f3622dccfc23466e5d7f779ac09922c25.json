Scott Coffman, a middle school teacher, has been fostering an eight-year-old boy while the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother serves a jail sentence. Scott and Mara both have five days left until they must say good-bye to the ones they love the most.\n\nThrough their stories, Julie Lawson Timmer explores the individual limits of human endurance and the power of relationships, and shows that sometimes loving someone means holding on, and sometimes it means letting go.\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nePub: 309 pages\nPublisher: Putnam Adult (September 9, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 039916734X\nISBN-13: 978-0399167348\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32f3bb0f3622dccfc23466e5d7f779ac09922c25","amp;dn":"Five+Days+Left+%28Sep+2014%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32f3bb0f3622dccfc23466e5d7f779ac09922c25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,243,187,15,54,34,220,207,194,52,102,229,215,247,121,172,9,146,44,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
