Whether it's his quarter century\nold group with guitarist Bill Frisell and saxophonist Joe Lovano, or the early\nsaxophone/bass/drums trio of Dance (ECM, 1978) and Le Voyage (ECM, 1979), Motian\nhas spent much of his career as a leader exploring a format less intimate than\nthe duo, perhaps, but still small enough a conversational context to allow its\nparticipants to speak with a single voice. Lost In A Dream, recorded live at New\nYork's Village Vanguard in the winter of 2009, features a new trio with\nsaxophonist Chris Potter, with whom Motian has worked since 1994, and pianist\nJason Moran, whose relationship with the iconic drummer is just beginning.\n\nBeing an all-acoustic ensemble, the trio lacks the inherent ethereality of\nMotian's group with the electrically expansive Frisell, most notably on 2005's I\nHave the Room Above Her (ECM), but that doesn't mean it can't approach similar\nrarified atmospheres. Potter may be a firebrand when working with bassist Dave\nHolland, heard recently on the incendiary The Monterey Quartet: Live at the 2007\nMonterey Jazz Festival (Monterey Jazz Festival, 2009), but here he proves\nhimself as much a master of restraint as Motian, who contributes all but one\ntrack to this collection. Potter plays, in fact, with unusual economy and a\nsofter-than-usual timbre, holding off until over 20 minutes into this hour-long\nset, and the aptly titled &quot;Blue Midnight,&quot; before turning up the heat and\nleaning more towards his typically robust tone and expressionist approach.\n\nThe entire set works on an upward trajectory, progressing into increasingly\nliberated and powerful landscapes. The trio draws on material dating as far back\nas Voyage, including the free-wheeling &quot;Drum Music&quot; and equally open-ended\n&quot;Abacus,&quot; a solo feature for Motian, whose textural breadth and dynamism\ncontinue to evolve, even as he approaches octogenarian status. Motian's newer\nmaterial leans largely towards the subdued and lyrical, including the closing\n&quot;Cathedral,&quot; where Moran plays with a gentility slightly skewed by his\ncharacteristically idiosyncratic tendencies.\n\nMoran's career continues to be a curious one. Since emerging in the late-1990s,\nhis best work has been under the leadership of others, most notably saxophonist\nCharles Lloyd's Rabo de Nube (ECM, 2008) and reedman Don Byron's Ivey-Divey\n(Blue Note, 2005). Lost In a Dream demonstrates his specific aptitude as a band\nmember rather than band leader once again, as the pianist provides a shifting\nharmonic context for this bass-less trio, working beautifully with Motian's\nin-the-moment layering of percussive colors.\n\n&quot;Casino,&quot; the disc's longest track, demonstrates the trio's ability to mine the\nnuances of Motian's sketch-like writing, while the knotty, rubato &quot;Ten&quot; provides\nboth Moran and Potter the chance to explore greater strength and tensility. Lost\nIn A Dream may be the first salvo from this empathic new trio, but hopefully it\nwon't be the last.\n\n\nStyle: Free Improvisation/Avant-Garde","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:febe732f2e035d9338cbfc71c95751a89cf6f450","amp;dn":"Paul+Motian+-+Lost+In+A+Dream+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"febe732f2e035d9338cbfc71c95751a89cf6f450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,190,115,47,46,3,93,147,56,203,252,113,201,87,81,168,156,246,244,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
