ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an auspicious title for such a humble man, yet no one can deny that the grasp Morris has on science and faith issues is staggering.\nIn this updated classic, Morris walks the reader through historyÃ¢â‚¬â€real historyÃ¢â‚¬â€by showing the absurdity of evolution. From a wide variety of sciences, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, and geology, Morris presents clear evidence that the Bible gives us an astonishingly accurate record of the past, present, and future.\n\nAbout the author:\nHenry Morris, Ph.D., (deceased) earned the title, &quot;The Father of Modern Creationism,&quot; through with his numerous writings about the creation/evolution debate. Dr. Henry M. Morris truly was a man of science and a staunch man of God. He was even said to have set the terms of debate about evolution for the second half of the 20th century by one Pulitzer Prize-winning academician. Dr. Morris began his serious study of the Bible in the 1930s and authoring books in the 1940s, but it was his landmark work, co-authored with Dr. John Whitcomb, titled The Genesis Flood in 1961 that influenced generations to begin discovering the fallacies of evolution and the biblical truth of creation.He was the founder of the Institute for Creation Research in California.
