This DVD compilation has footage from Van Halen I through 1984 albums. All this footage has appeared on different DVDs before but I gathered all this footage and put it all this collection.\nThe footage on The Early Days II is totally different then what was on The Early Days. I am working on The Early Days- The Ultimate Edition which will have Vol I &amp; Vol II put together but all the clips will be in their correct time frame.\n\nThere are a couple of notes on this collection:\n(*) This originally was silent footage and I added audio from one of their early demo's.\n(#) This originally had audio from the Fair Warning album and what I did so it won't have copyrighted material was added audio from one of their 1981 boots.\n(!) This was orginally in PAL and transfered to NTSC.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Van Halen, ChrisUK, Cato, Radikal, Decatone, liquid_steel_az, guitard, asdfanofpriest, the filmers, &amp; to all the VH fans!! If it wasn't for you all this DVD wouldn't be possible...Ory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e812043a8a40520ab4bf22b8c803575e3637035","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+The+Early+Days+II+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e812043a8a40520ab4bf22b8c803575e3637035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,129,32,67,168,164,5,32,171,75,242,43,140,128,53,117,227,99,112,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
