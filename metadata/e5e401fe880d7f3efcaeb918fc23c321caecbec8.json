In short, he is a star. The film explores issues of privacy, internet bullying and ageing, and illuminates how even the most rambunctious individuals have a human side. It is an intelligent, hilarious and unexpectedly poignant look at one man's response to internet fame, and is ultimately a story about how a so-called humiliation can become a beacon of light to many.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1600 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.76:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 726 MB\nSubtitles: English (available from MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-T\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5e401fe880d7f3efcaeb918fc23c321caecbec8","amp;dn":"BBC+Storyville+2010+YouTube+Hero+The+Winnebago+Man+PDTV+Xvid+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5e401fe880d7f3efcaeb918fc23c321caecbec8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,228,1,254,136,13,127,62,252,174,185,24,252,35,195,33,202,236,190,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
