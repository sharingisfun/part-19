During World War II, Manhattan was jailed in Italy for refusing to serve in Benito Mussolini's fascist army. Later during World War II he operated a radio station called &quot;Radio Freedom,&quot; broadcasting to occupied Europe. He also wrote political commentaries for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).\nBesides lecturing and writing short stories, essays, articles, novels and plays, he has written several best-sellers.\nDespite having an intellectual outlook somewhat at odds with Christian fundamentalism, many of Manhattan's books were sold by Jack Chick, an American fundamentalist publisher.
