Thanks again Webchella. A word of caution though. This ISO file contains unlabeled folders and files of FLA files. I had to manually change the ext to FLAC for them to play AND rename everything as well. I used the free version of Power ISO to extract the ISO file so maybe that had something to do with it. If anyone else has had a different result with this torrent I'd love to know what you did. In the end the BEST sounding discography on cd I've heard. THANKS AGAIN!\n\nCan't you upload ACDC - Ultimate Paper Sleeve Collection (19 CDs Bot) with the remaned files already in the Flac version? I have download it and it would save me a lot of trouble to change to Flac and rename it... Cheers mate.\n\nI added Black Ice to complete the Discography.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aee9493a00a1e9a4eb5a83b1fa850518febbb28","amp;dn":"ACDC+Discography+%28Ultimate+Paper+Sleeve+Collection%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aee9493a00a1e9a4eb5a83b1fa850518febbb28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,238,148,147,160,10,30,154,78,181,168,59,31,168,80,81,143,235,187,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
