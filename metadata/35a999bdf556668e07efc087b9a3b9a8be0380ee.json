In Beyond Reason, internationally acclaimed math and science author A. K. Dewdney answers this question by examining eight insurmountable mathematical and scientific roadblocks that have stumped thinkers across the centuries, from ancient mathematical conundrums such as &quot;squaring the circle,&quot; first attempted by the Pythagoreans, to GÃƒÂ¶del's vexing theorem, from perpetual motion to the upredictable behavior of chaotic systems such as the weather.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n=================\n\nIntroduction: Where Reason Cannot Go.\n\nMath in the Cosmos.\n\n1.
