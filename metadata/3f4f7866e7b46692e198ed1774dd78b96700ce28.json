It is democratic, ever-changing, and ingenious in its assimilation of other cultures.  Today, English runs through the heart of world finance, medicine, and the internet, and it is understood by nearly two billion people across our world.  And it seems set to go on.  Yet it was very nearly wiped out in its early years.\n\nIn this thoroughly researched and ground=breaking book, Melvyn Bragg shows us the remarkable story of the English language, from its modest beginnings around A.D. 500 as a minor guttural Germanic dialect to its current position as a truly established global language.  Along the way its colorful story takes us in a host of characters, locations, and events.  Bragg brings the reader from the early Angle-Saxon tribes and Alfred the Great's stubborn resistance to the Danes, through the impact of the Norman invasion in 1066, and on to the arrival of such early literary masterpieces as &quot;Beowulf&quot; and Geoffrey Chaucer's bawdy &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;.  With anecdotes only a novelist as accomplished as Bragg could capture, he tells the tales of Henry VIII's battles with the Church over bootleg Bibles, and the influence of the &quot;coarse&quot; playwright William Shakespeare, who alone contributed 2,000 new words to the language!  With its spread to North America, English expanded with the songs of the Creole slaves, with the bold language of Davy Crockett, and with Lewis and Clark's expedition West, which coined hundreds of new terms as the explorers discovered hitherto unknown flora and fauna.  From street slant and Dr. Johnson's dictionary to the role of English in India, Bragg leaves no stone unturned in his linguistic adventure.\n\nEmbracing elements of Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindi, and Gullah, this 1,500-year story covers a huge range of countries and peoples.  &quot;The Adventure of English&quot; is an enthralling narrative not only of power, religion, and trade but also of people and how they have changed--and continue, day by day, to change, along with the extraordinary language that is English.\n\nMELVYN BRAGG has written several works of nonfiction and is the author of more than a dozen works of fiction, most recently &quot;A Son of War&quot; and &quot;The Soldier's Return&quot; (winner of the W. H. Smith Literary Aqard), also published by Arcade.  In addition to writing, Lord Bragg has worked extensively in television and radio, and currently hosts a weekly program on British television called &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;.  In 1999, he was made a life peer.  He lives in London and in Cumbria, in northwestern England.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f4f7866e7b46692e198ed1774dd78b96700ce28","amp;dn":"Adventure+of+English+-+Biography+of+a+Language+%28TV+series+and+Au","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f4f7866e7b46692e198ed1774dd78b96700ce28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,79,120,102,231,180,102,146,225,152,237,23,116,221,120,185,103,0,206,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
