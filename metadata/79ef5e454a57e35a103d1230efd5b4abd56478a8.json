She is neglected by her busy husband, Bhupati (Shailen Mukherjee), a politically active newspaper publisher. When Bhupati's younger cousin Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee), a sensitive, intellectual student on break from the university, comes for an extended visit, Charu enjoys Amal's company, and the two while away the hours in conversation. But as their relationship grows closer, Charu falls in love with Amal. The film, based on a popular Indian novel, marks a significant point in Ray's career, as it bears the influence of Western film on his directorial style. Shown at the 1965 Berlin Film Festival, the film was curiously and inexplicably rejected by the committee at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Charulata.1964.Satyajit.Ray.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.46 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate : 1740 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 14.3 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate : 1616 Kbps\n      Width : 608 pixels\n      Height : 448 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.236\n      StreamSize : 1.35 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate : 115 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 98.5 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nBengali audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nIMDB: tt0057935","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79ef5e454a57e35a103d1230efd5b4abd56478a8","amp;dn":"Charulata.1964.Satyajit.Ray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79ef5e454a57e35a103d1230efd5b4abd56478a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,239,94,69,74,87,227,90,16,61,18,48,239,213,180,171,213,100,120,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
