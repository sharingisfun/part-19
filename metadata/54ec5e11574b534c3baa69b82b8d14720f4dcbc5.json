Acclaimed restaurateur and host, Tom Colicchio, along with his trusted team of experts, pit 16 of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hottest new restaurants against each other in a series of challenges aimed at determining who provides the best all-around, top-to-bottom experience. Tom will travel across the nation in search of only one restaurant that deserves a cash prize and to be crowned Ã¢â‚¬Å“Best New RestaurantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The series is modeled after the UK hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“RamsayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best RestaurantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from executive producer Gordon Ramsay.\n\n\nSummary:\nIn the first round of competition, the restaurants are divided into pairs based around a common theme reflected in their concepts or culinary influences. All are challenged to the same three tasks testing their overall performance, the strength of their staff, and the clarity of their concept. First, the restaurants are subjected to a &quot;Pressure Test,&quot; in which 30 hungry diners descend on the restaurants without notice to see how the businesses handle the stress of a packed house.\n\nNext, Tom sends in two &quot;Undercover Diners&quot; wired with hidden cameras in order to get a patronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective when the restaurants do not know they are being judged. Finally, the two paired-up restaurants come together in a neutral location and serve dinner for 30 VIP diners. At the end of each of the first eight episodes, Tom declares one restaurant the victor, and the establishments move on to the semifinals.\n\nThe semifinal rounds will feature the restaurants battling in two groups to open a pop-up restaurant based around what the eateries see as the next evolution of their current concepts. The grand finale pits the final two restaurants against each other in a head-to-head contest to put forward their best service possible for a group of 50 VIP diners at TomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s restaurant Riverpark in New York City.\n\n\n-----------------------\n\ntitle........: italian cuisine\ngenre(s).....: competition/food/reality-tv\nruntime......: 43:05\nsize.........: 319MB\nresolution...: 720x404\nvideo........: x264\naudio........: AAC 2ch\nair date.....: 01/21/15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54ec5e11574b534c3baa69b82b8d14720f4dcbc5","amp;dn":"Best.New.Restaurant.S01E01.Italian.Cuisine.HDTV.x264-DaViEW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54ec5e11574b534c3baa69b82b8d14720f4dcbc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,236,94,17,87,75,83,76,59,170,105,184,43,141,20,114,15,77,203,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
