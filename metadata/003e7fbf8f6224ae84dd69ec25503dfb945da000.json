I have divided it up into 6 separate torrents because it was about 18 Gigs as one torrent. I have listed the titles here, but since I have already spent a lot of time on this, I have not provided a description. You can look each of them up to get more info if you wish.\n\nThis is torrent 3 of 6 containing:\n\nAncient Greek History\nTTC - Rome and the Barbarians\nTTC - 1066 (The Conquest) Prof. J Paxton [2012]\nGordon S. Wood - The Radicalism of the American Revolution\nNathaniel Philbrick - Bunker Hill [bobPocket]\nCivil War - One Man Great Enough\nThe 33 Strategies Of War - Audiobook 192kbps - JackDilla\n\n\nHope this is satisfactory--let me know if it's not.\nI will seed for as long as possible, but give me some help.
