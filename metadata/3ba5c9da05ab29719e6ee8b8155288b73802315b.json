With John Coltrane beside him in the front line, and the smooth-as-cream rhythm section of Philly Joe Jones (drummer), Paul Chambers (drums), and Red Garland (piano), Miles creates, on STEAMIN', a definitive slice of sophisticated post bop. \n\n\nWhether treating standards (&quot;When I Fall in Love;&quot; &quot;Surrey With the Fringe On Top&quot;) or Thelonious Monk (&quot;Well, You Needn't&quot;), Miles and company never misstep, turning in a record for the ages that will not go stale, no matter how many times it's played. The 2007 reissue features beautifully remastered sound.\n\nThis classic Prestige session (one of four cut for the label by Davis' first permanent group) has been reissued many times. Davis is heard with his classic quintet of 1956 (which featured tenor-saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Philly Joe Jones) performing six numbers, all of which are memorable. Highpoints are Surrey with the Fringe on Top, Diane and When I Fall in Love; Davis's muted tone rarely sounded more beautiful. 6 tracks.\n\n\n\nRecorded at the Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, New Jersey on May 11 &amp; October 26, 1956. Originally released on Prestige (7200). Includes liner notes by Joe Goldberg and Chris Albertson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n   1. &quot;Surrey With the Fringe On Top&quot; (Richard Rodgers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:07\n   2. &quot;Salt Peanuts&quot; (Dizzy Gillespie-Kenny Clarke) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:09\n   3. &quot;Something I Dreamed Last Night&quot; (Sammy Fain) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:17\n   4. &quot;Diane&quot; (Lew Pollack / ErnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ RapÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:52\n   5. &quot;Well You Needn't&quot; (Thelonious Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:22\n   6. &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; (Victor Young) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n\n\n\n\nMiles Davis (trumpet) \nJohn Coltrane (tenor saxophone) \nRed Garland (piano) \nPaul Chambers (bass) \nPhilly Joe Jones (drums)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba5c9da05ab29719e6ee8b8155288b73802315b","amp;dn":"Steamin%5C%27+With+The+Miles+Davis+Quintet+%281961%29+%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba5c9da05ab29719e6ee8b8155288b73802315b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,165,201,218,5,171,41,113,158,110,232,184,21,82,136,183,56,2,49,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
