It is a must-have tool for anyone shooting in low-light or fast-action situations -- including news, sports, wedding, and event coverage -- where high ISO photography is required and the resulting noise compromises the image.\n\nNoise Ninja often yields a two-stop improvement in effective image quality, while preserving important image detail. In addition, it can produce cleaner, smoother enlargements from low-ISO images.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2241a85e85eee693b33cd5ca84f23270c4592db5","amp;dn":"Noise+Ninja+2.1.1+for+Intel+OS+X+%28latest+as+of+Dec+2006%29++%2B+seri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2241a85e85eee693b33cd5ca84f23270c4592db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,65,168,94,133,238,230,147,179,60,213,202,132,242,50,112,196,89,45,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
