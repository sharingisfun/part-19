Like all except five of his works, it originally appeared in serial form (published in monthly installments). \n\nMany elements within the novel follow events in Dickens' own life, and it is probably the most autobiographical of all of his novels.\n\nIn the preface to the 1867 Charles Dickens edition, he wrote, \n&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.&quot; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(novel)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(novel)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCast:\nGary Cady \nTimothy Spall \nSheila Hancock \nMiriam Margolyes\nPhil Daniels\nJohn Moffatt.\n\n\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 01 of 10 - I Fall Into Disgrace                    \n(An idyllic childhood is shattered)\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 02 of 10 - I Begin Life On My Own Account   \n(Boarding school brings both friendship and hardship)\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 03 of 10 - Betsy Trotwood                        \n(David runs away in search of his only living relative)\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 04 of 10 - The Question of My Future        \n(A trip to Yarmouth has unforeseen consequences)\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 05 of 10 - Good And Bad Angels              \n(Is Steerforth a true friend?)\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 06 of 10 - The Beginning Of A Long Journey  \n(Emily runs away with the unreliable Steerforth)\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 07 of 10 - Wickfield And Heep               \n(David takes a job with his old headmaster, Dr Strong)\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 08 of 10 - Mischief                         \n(Is Dora capable of being a poor man's wife?)\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 09 of 10 - My Beloved Dora                  \n(Uriah Heep's villainy is finally uncovered. )\n\nDavid Copperfield - Part 10 of 10 - I Have Loved You All My Life     \n(Dora has died and David contemplates his future.)\n\n\n\nThis torrent was ripped from the audio torrent site - radioarchive.cc - Registration is FREE!!\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0011240e9c062d45c701f01c6ee231aa4e8f29","amp;dn":"David+Copperfield+-+Charles+Dickens++%2810+Episodes+-+BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0011240e9c062d45c701f01c6ee231aa4e8f29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,0,17,36,14,156,6,45,69,199,1,240,28,110,226,49,170,78,143,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
