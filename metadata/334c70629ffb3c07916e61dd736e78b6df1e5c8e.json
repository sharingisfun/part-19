Now, with JeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband gone, what began as an off-the-cuff idea has grown into a group of six women who meet the second Tuesday of every month for a potluck supper, for wine and laughterÃ¢â‚¬â€and for books.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Loretta, who deals with the lack of intimacy in her marriage by diving into erotic novels. Dorothy, whose ruffian sons are a never-ending source of stress. May entertains the group with her outrageous dating stories, while Mitzi finds something political to rant about in every bookÃ¢â‚¬â€including LorettaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trashy romances. Even Janet, with her mousy shyness and constant blush, has helped Jean rediscover the joy in life.\n\nSo when JeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family starts unraveling againÃ¢â‚¬â€her daughter forced into rehab and her troubled teen granddaughter, Bailey, coming to live with her in the interimÃ¢â‚¬â€she turns to the book club for comfort and support. And, together, they all, even Bailey, discover that family is what you make of it, especially the family you chooseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n**\n\nReview\n\nPraise for *The Sister Season*\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Emotionally honest and psychologically astute, The Sister Season is ultimately an uplifting story about the pull of the past, the need for forgiveness, and the redemptive power of familial love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Liza Gyllenhaal, author of A Place for Us\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Sister Season is a powerful, honest look at the harm that ripples out from every unkindness, and the strength inherent in the sisterly bond.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Heidi Jon Schmidt, author of The HarbormasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daughter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:334c70629ffb3c07916e61dd736e78b6df1e5c8e","amp;dn":"The+Accidental+Book+Club+-+Jennifer+Scott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"334c70629ffb3c07916e61dd736e78b6df1e5c8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,76,112,98,159,251,60,7,145,110,97,221,115,110,120,182,223,30,92,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
