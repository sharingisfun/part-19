R. Martin and multiple-award winning editor Gardner Dozois\n\nBurroughsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A Princess of Mars. BradburyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Martian Chronicles. HeinleinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Red Planet. These and so many more inspired generations of readers with a sense that science fictionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest wonders did not necessarily lie far in the future or light-years across the galaxy but were to be found right now on a nearby world tantalizingly similar to our ownÃ¢â‚¬â€a red planet that burned like an ember in our night sky . . . and in our imaginations.\n\nThis new anthology of fifteen all-original science fiction stories, edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois, celebrates the Golden Age of Science Fiction, an era filled with tales of interplanetary colonization and derring-do. Before the advent of powerful telescopes and space probes, our solar system could be imagined as teeming with strange life-forms and ancient civilizationsÃ¢â‚¬â€by no means always friendly to the dominant species of Earth. And of all the planets orbiting that G-class star we call the Sun, none was so steeped in an aura of romantic decadence, thrilling mystery, and gung-ho adventure as Mars.\n\nJoin such seminal contributors as Michael Moorcock, Mike Resnick, Joe R. Lansdale, S. M. Stirling, Mary Rosenblum, Ian McDonald, Liz Williams, James S. A. Corey, and others in this brilliant retro anthology that turns its back on the cold, all-but-airless Mars of the Mariner probes and instead embraces an older, more welcoming, more exotic Mars: a planet of ancient canals cutting through red deserts studded with the ruined cities of dying races.\n\nTable of contents:\nRED PLANET BLUES (Introduction) by George R.R.
