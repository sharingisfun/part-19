This was not exactly a political crime, but the Government wanted a show of efficiency and a conviction; and under the direction of a relentless police lieutenant, confessions were extracted from the Naves brothersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½by torture.\n\nAlthough the brothers renounced their confessions in court, although they were ably defended by a courageous lawyer, and although neither a corpse nor the money was ever discovered, a conviction was obtainedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½after three trialsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the Naves brothers were sentenced to 25 years in jail. Much later the supposed murder victim turned up alive. The brothers were releasedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½paroled, not acquitted. In 1960 their conviction was reversed, and the one surviving brother received a little money in restitution.\n\n&quot;The Case of the Naves Brothers,&quot; which Luiz Sergio Person made in 1967 is not a documentary. But based as it is on journalistic accounts of the case and deriving much of its dialogue from court records, it has the feel of documentary ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or, more accurately, the feel of a documented history drained of any random emotion. But where it departs from documented history, in its scenes of prison torture, the film achieves an intensity that is almost sensuous in its portrayal of physical terror. Indeed, Person seems to want to oppose the painful fluidity of the torture scenes to the awkward dead-pan matter-of-factness of everything else.\n\nAnd yet it is everything else that makes the success of &quot;The Case of the Naves Brothers.&quot; It is not a complete successs. On a technical level the film seems all but primitive; there is no performance to praise except that of Anselmo Duarte as the surprisingly open-faced gentle looking police lieutenant; the two brothers hardly exist as personalities, receding into a kind of anonymous celebrity behind the facts and charges that constitute their case.\n\nBut the movie has an air of understated authenticity that builds throughout the long and quite exciting trial and that depends less upon the rhetoric of courtroom drama than upon the intricacies of courtroom power. To this extent, &quot;The Case of the Naves Brothers&quot; is a political filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not a film of partisan politics, but a film that manages on rather honorable terms to fashion a dramatic image out of political reality.\n\nLuiz Sergio Person is a native of the temperate city of SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo, and this background helps explain why his work is more reserved, more intellectual, than most of the generally impassioned Brazilian Cinema Nuovo. If this is true, Person is a credit to his city and its traditions.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Irmaos Naves.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.12 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 32mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 728 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 32mn\n      Bit rate : 1 526 Kbps\n      Width : 608 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.652\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.284\n      Stream size : 1 011 MiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 32mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 127 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0139927\n\nPortuguese audio; English and Spanish subpack\n\nMy rip of the recently launched Brazilian DVD\n\nL.S.Person - O Caso dos Irmaos Naves (1967) \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60882f79fb60d4dce49fcbdf487eda180b431d28","amp;dn":"L.S.Person+-+O+Caso+dos+Irmaos+Naves+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60882f79fb60d4dce49fcbdf487eda180b431d28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,136,47,121,251,96,212,220,228,159,203,223,72,126,218,24,11,67,29,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
