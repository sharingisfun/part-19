From 1927 to Ã¢â‚¬â„¢33, he wrote and presented something in the region of eighty broadcasts using the new medium of radio. Radio Benjamin gathers the surviving transcripts, which appear here for the first time in English. This eclectic collection demonstrates the range of BenjaminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thinking and his enthusiasm for popular sensibilities. His celebrated Ã¢â‚¬Å“Enlightenment for ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ youth programs, his plays, readings, book reviews, and fiction reveal Benjamin in a creative, rather than critical, mode. They flesh out ideas elucidated in his essays, some of which are also represented here, where they cover topics as varied as getting a raise and the history of natural disasters, subjects chosen for broad appeal and examined with passion and acuity.\n\nDelightful and incisive, this is Walter Benjamin channeling his sophisticated thinking to a wide audience, allowing us to benefit from a new voice for one of the twentieth centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most respected thinkers. \n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book in ePUB format:\n\n* Radio Benjamin - Walter Benjamin, Lecia Rosenthal (Editor), Jonathan Lutes (Translation), 480 pp. (Verso, 2014)\n \n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/12/04/a-crazy-mixed-up-day-thirty-brainteasers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/12/04/a-crazy-mixed-up-day-thirty-brainteasers/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/radio-benjamin-edited-by-lecia-rosentha-book-review-a-new-voice-graces-the-airwaves-9814289.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/radio-benjamin-edited-by-lecia-rosentha-book-review-a-new-voice-graces-the-airwaves-9814289.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ffea1e7f3706d76581d711a3b85d533752465ac","amp;dn":"Radio+Benjamin+-++Walter+Benjamin+%28Verso%2C+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ffea1e7f3706d76581d711a3b85d533752465ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,254,161,231,243,112,109,118,88,29,113,26,59,133,213,51,117,36,101,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
