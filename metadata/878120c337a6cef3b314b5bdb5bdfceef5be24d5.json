The Boston-based quintet found the middle ground between the menace of the Rolling Stones and the campy, sleazy flamboyance of the New York Dolls, developing a lean, dirty riff-oriented boogie that was loose and swinging and as hard as a diamond.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tFlac Conversion\n\n\n\nAerosmith signed with Columbia early in the '90s, before their contract with Geffen expired, and, as part of the deal, they owed a live album to Geffen -- hence the appearance of A Little South of Sanity, a double-disc set culled from tapes from the Get a Grip and Nine Lives tours. Considering its origins, the record couldn't help but feel a little like the contractual obligation it is, but it's to Aerosmith's credit that it doesn't sound entirely tired. Not that it sounds vital -- Steven Tyler's adolescent schtick sounds particularly embarrassing as he approaches his 50th birthday, and newer material like &quot;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)&quot; or even the hit &quot;Amazing&quot; pales in comparison to their '70s and late-'80s classics. Still, Aerosmith developed into world-class showmen during the first Bush era, which is why A Little South of Sanity will be an entertaining romp for longtime fans; they're likely not to be disappointed by the slickness that runs rampant over the record, nor will they be dismayed by the predictable song selection, two criticisms that could be offered as proof that Aerosmith is past their prime, because it's all part of the show. \n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Eat The Rich\n02.Love In An Elevator\n03.Falling In Love (Is Hard On The Knees)\n04.Same Old Song And Dance\n05.Hole In My Soul\n06.Monkey On My Back\n07.Livin' On The Edge\n08.Cryin'\n09.Rag Doll\n10.Angel\n11.Janie's Got A Gun\n12.Amazing\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Back In The Saddle\n02.Last Child\n03.The Other Side\n04.Walk On Down\n05.Dream On\n06.Crazy\n07.Mama Kin\n08.Walk This Way\n09.Dude (Looks Like A Lady)\n10.What It Takes\n11.Sweet Emotion\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:878120c337a6cef3b314b5bdb5bdfceef5be24d5","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+A+Little+South+Of+Sanity+%281998%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"878120c337a6cef3b314b5bdb5bdfceef5be24d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,129,32,195,55,166,206,243,179,20,181,189,181,189,252,238,245,190,36,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
