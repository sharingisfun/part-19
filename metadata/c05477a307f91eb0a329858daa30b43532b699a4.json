Her one-of-a-kind cakes and cookies are not only served with ice cream, they get crumbled on top and incorporated into the ice cream base itself.\n\nSundae combinations dazzle with bold and inspired sauces, such as Whiskey Caramel and Honey Spiked with Chilies. And JeniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crunchy Ã¢â‚¬Å“gravelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (crumbly sundae toppings)Ã¢â‚¬â€such as Salty Graham Gravel and Everything Bagel GravelÃ¢â‚¬â€are unlike toppings anyone has ever seen before.\n\nStore-bought ice cream can be used for all the desserts in the book, but it will be hard to resist JeniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breakthrough recipes for dairy-free ice cream, frozen custard, and soft-serve. Thirty brand-new flavors, including Cumin &amp; Honey Butterscotch and Extra-Strength Root Beer Ice Cream, attest to the magic of this unique and alluring collection.\n \nREVIEW\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Using ice cream as a main ingredient for another dessert?

Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream Desserts isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a simple ice cream book: there are big ideas at play here. The book itself is actually kind of a brilliant concept: while recipes for all of the ice cream flavors are included, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not necessary to make them yourself to complete the recipes. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stopping you from buying JeniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (or whatever your ice cream of choice may be) direct from the source and sandwiching it between two of the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cookies? Or plopping it on top of the fresh fruit crisps?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Eater\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sophisticated, playful, and amazing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nOmnivoracious blog\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n \nJeni Britton Bauer started making ice cream in 1996 and now perfects her crafts at JeniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Splendid Ice Creams.
