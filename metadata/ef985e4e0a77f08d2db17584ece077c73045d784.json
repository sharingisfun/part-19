Born and bred in the Delta tradition, KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success as a bluesman was virtually guaranteed while he performed under the umbrella of his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genre, but when he embarked on artistic directions of his own, he was systematically disowned by major record labels. Unwilling to sacrifice his artistic style, he introduced hip-hop undertones and deejay-distorted electronica into his musical repertoire. Branded as a rebel with a cause, he fled to Denmark to cool his heels in the more liberal environment that flourished in Europe. Upon returning to the United States in 1994, he started his own independent record label, established himself as an actor, and won three Grammy Awards by 2003.\n\nAfter his 1986 album debut, King toured Europe and Texas, then settled in Austin for four years. He signed with Hightone Records and in 1990 released a standard acoustic style album called Cry of the Prophets. This follow-up album incorporated elements not previously associated with Depression-era Delta bluesÃ¢â‚¬â€hip-hop and electronica-style deejay scratching. High-tone nixed the album under pressure from its parent company, Warner Bros., who objected to the gansta rap and hip-hop influences. King disagreed, arguing that these styles are the essence of modern blues because the sentiment is the same. Warner refused to release the recording.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef985e4e0a77f08d2db17584ece077c73045d784","amp;dn":"Chris+Thomas+King+-+Cry+Of+The+Prophets+%5B1990%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef985e4e0a77f08d2db17584ece077c73045d784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,152,94,78,10,119,240,141,45,177,117,132,236,224,119,199,48,69,215,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
