A realm where you don't have to go to work or worry about your health; where you can look like a hero or a goddess; where you can fly space-ships, slay dragons, yet all of it feels completely real. A realm where there are no consequences and no responsibilities. Or would it be your worst nightmare? Stuck in an endless state of war and chaos where the pain and fear feels real and from which not even death can offer an escape. Prison or playground. Heaven or hell. This is where you find out. This is white-knuckle action, sprawling adventure, merciless satire and outrageous humour like you've never experienced. This is Bedlam.\n\nUnabridged (ca. 13.4 hours)\nRead by Angus King\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76c10fb8f4b3460d99ed3fbf8251d34ac3b9371","amp;dn":"Christopher+Brookmyre+-+Bedlam+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76c10fb8f4b3460d99ed3fbf8251d34ac3b9371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,108,16,251,143,75,52,96,217,158,211,251,248,37,29,52,172,59,147,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
