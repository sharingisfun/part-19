Filled with information, largely in the form of tables and charts, from hard statistics on vegetable production and consumption to fascinating esoterica, such as vegetable botanical names and vegetable names in nine languages (French for cauliflower is chou-fleur; a Spanish onion is a cebolla), Knott's Handbook is part Farmer's Almanac, part encyclopedia, and part dictionary. But with its detailed, practical specifics on planting rates, schedules, and spacing; soils and fertilizers; methods for controlling diseases; greenhouse vegetable and crop production; insect pest identification; harvesting and storage; and vegetable marketing, it's an indispensable helpmate to the farmer in the field and in the marketplace. \n\nThoroughly updated and expanded to reflect the latest technical advances in vegetable growing, the Fourth Edition contains new information on water management with drip irrigation; seed priming and seed germination tests; plant tissue testing; petiole sap testing; windbreaks; and weed management. A revised discussion of allowable pesticide and herbicide use as well as the newest in worker protection standards makes the Fourth Edition even more relevant to today's commercial grower. \n\nThe new edition of Knott's Handbook for Vegetable Growers comes in a convenient portable size and features a sturdy flexible cover with pages that lie flat, on the desk or in the field. Fulfilling James Edward Knott's original vision of a concise, comprehensive, and eminently useable handbook, this new edition of the 1957 classic is the ultimate day-to-day field reference, and as indispensable to a farmer's work as good weather. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:208bb415d616c3e726d7d31b621b6198941b6772","amp;dn":"Knott%5C%27s+Handbook+for+Vegetable+Growers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"208bb415d616c3e726d7d31b621b6198941b6772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,139,180,21,214,22,195,231,38,215,211,27,98,27,97,152,148,27,103,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
