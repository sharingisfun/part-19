Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.\nTo show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color.\n\nCONTENTS\nAcknowledgments xi\n1.INTRODUCTION\n2.ELEMENTS OF THE MAP\n3.MAP GENERALIZATION: LITILE WHITE LIES AND LOTS OF THEM\n4.BLUNDERS THAT MISLEAD\n5.MAPS THAT ADVERTISE\n6.DEVELOPMENT MAPS (OR, How TO SEDUCE THE TOWN BOARD)\n7.MAPS FOR POLITICAL PROPAGANDA\n8.MAPS, DEFENSE, AND DISINFORMATION: FOOL THINE ENEMY\n9.DATA MAps: MAKING NONSENSE OF THE CENSUS\n10.COWR: ATTRACTION AND DISTRACTION\n11.EPILOGUE\nAPPENDIX: LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE\nSELECTED READINGS FOR FURTHER EXPWRATION\nSOURCES OF ILLUSTRATIONS\nINDEX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:550c8dc77d0ceb0a575ed11dff95be93846218a8","amp;dn":"How+to+Lie+with+Maps+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"550c8dc77d0ceb0a575ed11dff95be93846218a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,12,141,199,125,12,235,10,87,94,209,29,255,149,190,147,132,98,24,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
