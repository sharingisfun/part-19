This Japanese band have produced several split projects and have a double CD early works compilation that is due out any day. Anyway, the 7 songs here are themed around 5 different serial killers. We start off with &quot;Motherfucker&quot; (Ted Bundy). The production is so damn raw and this is more hard driving and not as doomy as previous material I have heard but includes some ripping lead guitars. &quot;Soul Discharge&quot; (Mark Essex) is next and pretty damn brutal as well. The vocals are very tortured but the band build up a cool groove. &quot;Red Ripper Blues&quot; (Andaei Chikatilo) starts with some samples and tasty blues guitar and spaced out synthesizer sounds but donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be fooled as this band plans to rip your head off every time. Awesome space blues!!!!! &quot;Filth Bitch Boogie&quot; (Aileen Wuoanos) also has some samples to start things off before a pretty cool bluesy hard rock riff takes the song on itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s way. Nothing to do with the old TANK song of the same title. Next, the band take on the classic Cactus song, &quot;One Way or Another&quot;, and do a pretty good job with a nice long jam. &quot;Candy Man&quot; (Dean Coall) is a slow heavy, more doomy song and the longest on the CD at 7? minutes. Reminds me a bit of Cathedral this one! The CD closes with the slow building doomy, instrumental, &quot;El Topo&quot;. I assume titled after the cool film by Alejandro Jadorowsky. I wish the production value was a bit higher as it is a bit hard on the ears at times but great songs and playing. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7847af936344366d445f6f3f5a9ed87b35a33d3e","amp;dn":"Church+of+Misery+-+The+Second+Coming+%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7847af936344366d445f6f3f5a9ed87b35a33d3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,71,175,147,99,68,54,109,68,95,111,63,90,158,216,123,53,163,61,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
