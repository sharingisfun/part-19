This album was made for putting on in bed in the morning.\n\nShe contends with the human condition; growing up, painting the future as observed from the past and falling / being in love. The tracks alternate between upbeat anthems and down-tempo moodiness. They are modestly soul searching, inspired by the plain and simple.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3b505a69a5543252eba7eda56eba584c3cdfb48","amp;dn":"Liz+Lawrence+-+Bedroom+Hero+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3b505a69a5543252eba7eda56eba584c3cdfb48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,181,5,166,154,85,67,37,46,186,126,218,86,235,165,132,195,205,251,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
