The songs are terrific, the arrangements dynamic, the orchestra a blast, the recording quality first-rate and Mercury gave it all top-quality packaging. Upon release, it became a big hit and I got it when I was around 16 and it just bowled me over. It still sounds great. One day a C.D. will be released of the album plus its myriad alternate takes where Sarah over the same arrangements changes her vocal delivery drastically (&quot;I'll Never Smile Again&quot; emerges unique each time). Meanwhile, this is dynamic, accessible jazz at its best, with the top players in the game and Sassy in top form. Some of the songs are rarities and I was told the lyrics to &quot;Cherokee&quot; originated with this album (maybe, maybe not, but I was told it). \nNote on the cover how slim, how hip and how fashionable Sarah is and just damned cute. \nIn her beginning days she was achingly homely, then she went into a too-glamorous phase, and later she became hefty. But here she is slim, hip, happy, glowing and really darling. She was always of a happy disposition, which made her a favorite to work with. \nShe loved to chat and chatter in recording sessions and when she recorded her single &quot;Please Mr. Brown&quot; first did a parody in what I guess was meant to be a Bronx accent! \nEverything in this album bespeaks greatness, but intimate greatness. It's not a star turn but a great talent truly enjoying herself and offering her public the best. ~ Jim Andrews\n\nSarah really swings on this album, with tremendous backing from the full-bodied Ernie Williams orchestra. As with her album &quot;with Clifford Brown,&quot; this showcases Ms. Vaughan's dramatic swoops, bends, and incredible phrasing, but there are no unnecessary dramatics. Her voice is supple, very confident, and she evokes just the right emotions. Every song is a gem, even the shop-worn &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; is given a fresh treatment, and the bop &quot;Cherokee&quot; (featuring the first female vocal ever recorded) features stunning work by Adderley.\n\nThe band is fantastic and matches Ms. Vaughan's exuberance. There are excellent sax solos by Cannonball Adderley and Jerome Richardson, and personnel also include trombone greats J.J. Johnson and Kai Winding on trombone, Roy Haynes on drums, Jimmy Jones on piano and Ernie Royal on trumpet. Think an unrestrained Count Basie of his &quot;Atomic album&quot; era: This album will move you. The recording quality is excellent, both by today's standards and especially for a 1955 recording. One of the best of Ms. Vaughan's albums I've heard-get this one! \n\nPersonnel:\nSarah Vaughan, vocal with Ernie Wilkins and His Studio Orchestra\nTrumpet: Ernie Wilkins, Ernie Royal, Bernie Glow\nTrombone: J  J  Johnson, Kai Winding\nAlto: Julian ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCannonballÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Adderley, Sam Marowitz\nTenor/Flute: Jerome Richardson\nPiano: Jimmy Jones\nGuitar: Turk Van Lake\nBass: Joe Benjamin\nDrums: Roy Haynes\n\nSarah Vaughan - In the Land of Hi-Fi Tracks:\n01  Over The Rainbow (E  Y  Harburg-A  Arlen)\n02  Soon (G  &amp; I  Gershwin)\n03  Cherokee (R  Noble)\n04  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Never Smile Again (R  Lowe)\n05  DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Be On The Outside (S  Yyche-M  Watts-G  Kelly)\n06  How High The Moon (N  Hamilton)\n07  It ShouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Happen To A Dream (D  George-D  Ellington)\n08  Sometimes IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Happy (Caeser-Grey-Youmans)\n09  Maybe (G  &amp; I  Gershwin)\n10  An Occasional Man (H  Martin-R  Blane)\n11  Why CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t I (L  Hart-R  Rodgers)\n12  Oh My (J  Green)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c83e7a156792ce2a60782f26ecb29b508ac020e","amp;dn":"Sarah+Vaughan+-+In+the+Land+of+Hi-Fi+%281955%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c83e7a156792ce2a60782f26ecb29b508ac020e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,131,231,161,86,121,44,226,166,7,130,242,110,203,41,181,8,172,2,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
