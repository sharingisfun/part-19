In addition to numerous traditional Christian  themes, the series borrows characters and ideas from Greek and Roman mythology, as well as from traditionaland Irish fairy tales.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia presents the adventures of children who play central roles in the unfolding history of the fictional realm of Narnia, a place where animals talk, magic is common, and good battles evil. Each of the books (with the exception of The Horse and His Boy) features as its protagonists children from our world who are magically transported to Narnia, where they are called upon by the lion Aslan to help Narnia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47d138f6c7828421142de5fbc0025cf9f8753f87","amp;dn":"BBC+the+Chronicles+of+Narnia+1988+S01E01+NEW+WS.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47d138f6c7828421142de5fbc0025cf9f8753f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,209,56,246,199,130,132,33,20,45,229,251,192,2,92,249,248,117,63,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
