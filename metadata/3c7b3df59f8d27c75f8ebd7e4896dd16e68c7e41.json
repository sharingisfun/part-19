Where you can win a hundred dollars by eating all the doughnuts you want; where houses are built in a day; and where a boy named Homer Price can foil four slick bandits using nothing but his wits and pet skunk.\n\n\nThe comic genius of Robert McCloskey and his wry look at small-town America has kept readers in stitches for generations.\n\nFile Size: epub 2.49 Mb, mobi 2.56 Mb\n\n\n--------------------\n\nTitle:\n\nCENTERBURG TALES: More Adventures of Homer Price by Robert McCloskey\n\n\nDescription:\n\nFurther adventures of Homer Price, including those in which a juke box sets the whole town singing against its will and in which a mad scientist develops weeds that overrun the town.\n\nFile Size: epub 1.74 Mb, mobi 1.29 Mb\n\n\n==============================\n\n\nNotes: Tested all four files out regarding Table of Contents and their functionality.\n\nFor the epub files I used Calibre on the desktop PC, moon+reader and Aldiko on a Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model). For the mobi files I used Kindle for PC and Kindle for Android.\n\nThe double tapping the pictures on the screen in Kindle for Android works really well to enlarge the pictures. You just need to make sure the device is orientated correctly to get the best enlargement.\n\n\nEnjoy the reminiscing.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c7b3df59f8d27c75f8ebd7e4896dd16e68c7e41","amp;dn":"Homer+Price+Centerburg+Tales+Robert+McCloskey+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c7b3df59f8d27c75f8ebd7e4896dd16e68c7e41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,123,61,245,159,141,39,199,95,142,189,126,72,150,221,22,230,140,126,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
