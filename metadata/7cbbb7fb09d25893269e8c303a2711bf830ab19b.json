There is no more authoritative or accessible introduction to the culture that gave us the Acropolis, Iliad and Odyssey, Herodotus and Thucydides, Sophocles and Aeschylus, Plato and Aristotle, and so much more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cbbb7fb09d25893269e8c303a2711bf830ab19b","amp;dn":"The+Ancient+Greeks%3A+New+Perspectives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cbbb7fb09d25893269e8c303a2711bf830ab19b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,187,183,251,9,210,88,147,38,158,140,48,58,39,17,191,131,10,177,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
