Lt. David Westwynter, a British soldier, stumbles into Freegypt, the only place to have remained independent of the godsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ influence. There, he encounters the followers of a humanist leader known as the Lightbringer, who has vowed to rid mankind of the shackles of divine oppression. As the world heads towards an apocalyptic battle, there is far more to this freedom fighter than it seems...\n\n2 - The Age of Zeus\nThe Olympians appeared a decade ago, living incarnations of the Ancient Greek gods on a mission to bring permanent order and stability to the world. Resistance has proved futile, and now humankind is under the jackboot of divine oppression. Until former London police officer Sam Akehurst receives an invitation too tempting to turn down: the chance to join a small band of guerrilla rebels armed with high-tech weapons and battlesuits. Calling themselves the Titans, they square off against the Olympians and their ferocious mythological monsters in a war of attrition which some will not survive.\n\n3 - The Age of Odin\nGideon Coxall was a good soldier but bad at everything else, until a roadside explosive device leaves him with one deaf ear and a British Army half-pension. So when he hears about the Valhalla Project, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a dream come true. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re recruiting former service personnel for excellent pay, no questions asked, to take part in unspecified combat operations. The last thing Gid expects is to find himself fighting alongside ancient Viking gods. The world is in the grip of one of the worst winters it has ever known, and RagnarÃƒÂ¶k Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the fabled final conflict of the Sagas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is looming.\n\n4 - Age of Aztec\nThe date is 4 Jaguar 1 Monkey 1 House; November 25th 2012, by the old reckoning. The Aztec Empire rules the world, in the name of Quetzalcoatl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Feathered Serpent Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and his brother gods. The Aztec reign is one of cruel and ruthless oppression, fuelled by regular human sacrifice. In the jungle-infested city of London, one man defies them: the masked vigilante known as the Conquistador. Then the Conquistador is recruited to spearhead an uprising, and discovers the terrible truth about the Aztecs and their gods. The clock is ticking. Apocalypse looms, unless the Conquistador can help assassinate the mysterious, immortal Aztec emperor, the Great Speaker. But his mission is complicated by Mal Vaughn, a police detective who is on his trail, determined to bring him to justice.\n\n5 - Age of Voodoo\nLex Dove thought he was done with the killing game. A retired British wetwork specialist, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s living the quiet life in the Caribbean, minding his own business. Then a call comes, with one last mission: to lead an American black ops team into a disused Cold War bunker on a remote island near his adopted home. The moneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good, which means the risks are high. Dove doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t discover just how high until he and his team are a hundred feet below ground, facing the horrifi c fruits of an experiment blending science and voodoo witchcraft. As if barely human monsters werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bad enough, a clock is ticking. Deep in the bowels of the earth, a god is waiting. And His anger, if roused, will be fearsome indeed.\n\n6 - Age of Godpunk\nWHOM THE GODS WOULD DESTROY...\nAll three novellas are now collected in a single volume; the ebook edition also includes bonus content: interviews and blogposts by the author.\nAGE OF ANANSI: Dion Yeboah leads an orderly, disciplined life... until the day the spider appears. What looks like an ordinary arachnid turns out to be Anansi, the trickster god of African legend, and its arrival throws DionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence into chaos. He is summoned to America to take part in a contest of trickery. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a life-or-death battle of wits, and in the end, only one person will be left standing...\nAGE OF SATAN: 1968. Guy Lucas is sent to an old-fashioned boarding school, where he is bullied and abused. A fellow student persuades him to perform a black mass and plead with Satan to intervene, with horrific consequences. For the next ten years, the shadow of Satan is cast across his life; he flees, but tragedy follows him. Eventually, he must confront the Devil, and learn the truth about himself...\nAGE OF GAIA: Billionaire Barnaby Pollard, energy magnate, has the world at his feet. The planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fossil fuel resources are his to exploit, as are the size-zero girlfriends he loves and leaves in endless succession. Until he meets Lydia, a beautiful and opinionated eco-journalist. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the very opposite of the kind of woman he normally dates: large and outspoken, with a firm belief that Mother Nature is not to be tampered with...\n\n\nBook #7 is here:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9976794/Lovegrove__James-Age_of_Shiva_(Pantheon_Series__7)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9976794/Lovegrove__James-Age_of_Shiva_(Pantheon_Series__7)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
