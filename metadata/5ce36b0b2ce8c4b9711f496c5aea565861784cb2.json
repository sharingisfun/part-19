Our senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing allow us to interact and adapt to the ever-changing world that surrounds us. &quot;The Senses&quot; gives an introduction to the intricate structures and functions of the body's sense organs, and examines some of the most common diseases that affect these organs. Readers will learn how even a temporary problem with one of the senses can dramatically affect how our bodies perceive the world.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: The Human Body: How It Works\nLibrary Binding: 168 pages\nPublisher: Chelsea House Pub (T) (September 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1604133627\nISBN-13: 978-1604133622\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce36b0b2ce8c4b9711f496c5aea565861784cb2","amp;dn":"The+Senses+%28The+Human+Body%3A+How+It+Works%29+by+Douglas+B.+Light+%5B%3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce36b0b2ce8c4b9711f496c5aea565861784cb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,227,107,11,44,232,196,185,113,31,73,108,90,234,86,88,97,120,76,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
