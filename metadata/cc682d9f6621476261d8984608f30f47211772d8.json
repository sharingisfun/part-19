Holy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Sunday are not only observed by Christians around the world, but are also recognized in calendars and by non-practitioners as commemorating the true timeline of events in the life of Christ. But apparent inconsistencies in the gospel accounts of Jesus' final week have puzzled Bible scholars for centuries. In The Mystery of the Last Supper, Colin Humphreys uses science to reveal the truth about Jesus' final days. Reconciling conflicting Gospel accounts and scientific evidence, Humphreys reveals the exact date of the Last Supper in a definitive new timeline of Holy Week.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc682d9f6621476261d8984608f30f47211772d8","amp;dn":"The+Mystery+of+the+Last+Supper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc682d9f6621476261d8984608f30f47211772d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,104,45,159,102,33,71,98,97,216,152,70,8,243,15,71,33,23,114,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
