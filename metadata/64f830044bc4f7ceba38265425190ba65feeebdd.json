This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey tells the story of a singer in the countdown who, to get a record deal, once rented an expensive studio and hired 25 musicians with a conductor, without having any money to pay for it.\n\nCasey remebers the group who once occupied the top five spots on the chart at the same time. He calls it an unbreakable record.\n\nOne listener wants to know, &quot;What was the biggest selling record that never reached the top 40?&quot;\n\n&quot;American Pie&quot; by Don Mclean goes on for 8 minutes and 22 seconds. As of March, 1972 it was the longest song to ever reach number one. It would only be in the countdown one more week, so in this broadcast, Casey plays the long version.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Did anyone ever have a number one record with their first hit, and then never have another hit after that?&quot; This would be one of the few questions where the answer doesn't involve the Beatles or Elvis! Casey says it's happened five times.\n\n40: Take A Look Around - Temptations\n39: Every Day Of My Life - Bobby Vinton\n38: I Can't Help Myself - Donnie Elbert\n37: No One To Depend On - Santana\n36: Taurus - Dennis Coffey\n35: Glory Bound - Grass Roots\n34: Softly Whispering I Love You - English Congregation\n33: Rockin' Robin - Michael Jackson\n32: My World - Bee Gees\n31: Ring The Living - Melanie\n30: Betcha By Golly Wow - Stylistics\n29: Crazy Mama - J.J.
