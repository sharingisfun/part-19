They've found plenty. Now, they come across settlers who have been victimized in a way that stirs memories in John Reid. Loss, vengeance, and redemption as pioneer idealism meets the reality of hard life on the prairie. A stand-alone tale that ties into an epic six part story that will test the mettle of the west's most legendary heroes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:391895029c7b5a3e5d07bb114523fd6a4d89f782","amp;dn":"The+Lone+Ranger+Vol+2+%231","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"391895029c7b5a3e5d07bb114523fd6a4d89f782","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,24,149,2,156,123,90,62,93,7,187,17,69,35,253,106,77,137,247,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
