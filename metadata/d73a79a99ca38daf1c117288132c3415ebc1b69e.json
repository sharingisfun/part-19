In 2008, Stephen King called Machen's &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; (included here) &quot;Maybe the best [horror story] in the English language&quot; in an interview. And H.P. Lovecraft wrote: &quot;Of living creators of cosmic fear raised to its most artistic pitch, few if any can hope to equal the versatile Arthur Machen, author of some dozen tales long and short, in which the elements of hidden horror and brooding fright attain an almost incomparable substance and realistic acuteness.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;The Arthur Machen Megapack&quot; presents 25 Classic Works by Arthur Machen, ranging from supernatural to war stories, including 3 poems and a critical essay by Vincent Starrett. Almost 1,200 pages!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d73a79a99ca38daf1c117288132c3415ebc1b69e","amp;dn":"The+Arthur+Machen+Megapack+-+25+Classic+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d73a79a99ca38daf1c117288132c3415ebc1b69e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,58,121,169,156,163,141,175,28,17,114,136,19,44,52,21,235,193,182,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
