Dr. Murray demonstrates his extensive teaching experience with easy to understand theory and a wide array of examples and helpful tips. Each lesson also includes several completely worked out practice problems like the ones you will see on homework and tests. Sample topics include linear and separable equations, second order equations, series solutions, systems of equations, and Laplace transforms. Dr. Murray received his Ph.D from UC Berkeley, his BS from Georgetown University, and has been teaching in the university setting for 10+ years.\n\nTotal length - 26:33","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb5c12e96b3257b920ba22aa06c4e58738dbd02c","amp;dn":"Educator.com+-+Differential+Equations+with+Dr.+William+Murray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb5c12e96b3257b920ba22aa06c4e58738dbd02c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,92,18,233,107,50,87,185,32,186,34,170,6,196,229,135,56,219,208,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
