It does work with daemon tools. The game will install ask you for the cd, hit continue. After the install ends click the .exe and it will start up.\n\nIn xp and vista if you do not run in 256 colors the title screen will be black, just move the mouse cursor over it and it will clear.\n\nThis game needs the wing32.dll to play, it will ask for it, take the wing32.dll and put it in the windows/system32 folder.\n\nIf you are running a 64-bit version of the game, the game will default install to it, you have to manual change it to install to 32 bit. The game will install to the 64-bit folder, and the wing32.dll will work in the syswow64 bit folder.\n\nI had trouble with sound on vista 64/32 so using a older operating system would be better, also buring to a disc.\n\nThis game has the Civil War Generals 2 demo and the Lords of Magic original demo on it as well.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b4e47e354a028634957d59d39938b27a5616d5d","amp;dn":"Robert+E.+Lee%2C+Civil+War+Genral","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b4e47e354a028634957d59d39938b27a5616d5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,78,71,227,84,160,40,99,73,87,213,157,57,147,139,39,165,97,109,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
