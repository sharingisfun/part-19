But how can private enterprises help China mitigate its macroeconomic problems such as unemployment, income inequality, financial disintermediation, and an unhealthy economic cycle? And what are the main obstacles to private enterprise development? Private Enterprises and ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Economic Development answers these questions by identifying the range of cultural, political and financial challenges confronting China's private enterprises, and assessing their performance and potential. Contributors also analyse the experiences and lessons of other countries, and propose strategies and policies to help China promote private enterprise development.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a086cc6f0b5bd700231998d9cac6906e0bb0c2f7","amp;dn":"Private+Enterprises+and+China%5C%27s+Economic+Development","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a086cc6f0b5bd700231998d9cac6906e0bb0c2f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,134,204,111,11,91,215,0,35,25,152,217,202,198,144,110,11,176,194,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
