The Next Life\n\n\n&quot;Suede&quot; is a fantastic, consistent collection of songs. From the catchy campness of opener &quot;So young&quot;, to the superb glam rock of &quot;Animal nitrate&quot; and &quot;Metal Mickey&quot;, to the powerful epics &quot;Pantomime horse&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot; - this is a music with blood pumping through its veins. And who can forget &quot;The drowners&quot;, the first Suede single, and an instant classic. Not only do Suede rock musically, but Brett Anderson is one of the most unique lyricists to come out of the 90's. Obviously influenced a lot by Morrissey, his lyrics range from obscure sexual imagery, to more obvious sexual imagery, to utter disgust. Suede are one of the best bands of the 90's. Listen to this album to hear where it all began.  \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 88\nArtist: Suede\nAlbum: Suede\nYear: 1993\nGenre: Pop/Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7df08ea79403444a11c6b6db581cef2358551c27","amp;dn":"Suede+-+Suede+%5BFLAC-1993%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7df08ea79403444a11c6b6db581cef2358551c27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,240,142,167,148,3,68,74,17,198,182,219,88,28,239,35,88,85,28,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
