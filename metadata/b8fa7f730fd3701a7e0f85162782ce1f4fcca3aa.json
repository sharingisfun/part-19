Here though, the man is at his best. Having gained success, which soon waned, with his first 3 albums during the explosion of punk in the late 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, in 1982 we find Jackson relocate to New York following the demise of his marriage. Whilst there, he absorbed the many different sounds of a hustling city, and wrote the finest songs of his career. To say that many artists could only dream of writing an album as good as this is no exaggeration. With only a three piece band to back him, all of which are rhythmic (percussion, drums and bass) there is a very tasty, distinctive low-key latin feel to this. With Jackson himself on piano and vocals, he has never sounded finer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sharp, cynical, smart. The opening track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Another WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ opens with the line ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI was so low, people almost made me give up trying,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this is Jackson fighting against anybody who never believed in him. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SteppinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ OutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ worth the price of the CD alone, is classic pop, something he has never quite repeated. Crisp piano, classic Graham Maby bass line, soothing vocalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ surely this is too good to be true! The second half of the album is much darker, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Breaking Us In TwoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a perfect, honest love song, while JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own doubts about the world we live in are to the fore with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“CancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Real MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Just when you think it canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get better the album ends with JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest moment, and a song which I personally believe is the best song ever written, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“A Slow Song.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Dark, sophisticated, moving ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jackson is crying out for a moments rest from the noise around him. Gradually it builds and builds into a complete masterpiece ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a mere review such as this doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do it justice. This is an album of breathtaking quality, and, unlike a lot of releases, is actually an album, not just 9 very good songs put together. Very special indeed.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nJoe Jackson (vocals, alto saxophone, piano, Fender Rhodes piano, electric piano, Hammond B-3 organs, Gem Organ, Minimoog synthesizer, vibes); \n\nSue Hadjopolous (vocals, flute, bongos, congas, timbales, xyolophone, orchestra bells); \n\nEd Roynesdal (vocals, keyboards, percussion); \n\nJoe Askew (vocals, keyboards, synthesizer, percussion); \n\nGraham Maby (vocals, bass, percussion); \n\nEd Rynesdal (violin); \n\nLarry Tolfree (drums); \n\nRicardo Torres (bongos, clave, cowbell); \n\nAl Weismann, Grace Millan (background vocals).\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
