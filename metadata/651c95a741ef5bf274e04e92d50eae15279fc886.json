Growing concern for issues such as population, women's and men's reproductive health, and the HIV and AIDS pandemic, has since provided new legitimacy for work on sexuality, health and rights.\n\nA detailed and up-to-date reference work, the Routledge Handbook of Sexuality, Health and Rights provides an authoritative overview of the main issues in the field today. Leading academics and practitioners are brought together to reflect on past, present and future approaches to understanding and promoting sexual health and rights. Divided into nine parts, it covers:\n\npioneering beginnings\nlanguage, discourse and sexual categories\nfrom sexuality to health\nthe reproductive imperative\nhow to have sex in an epidemic\nthe choreography of sex\nthe darker side of sex\nfrom sexual health to sexual rights\nstruggles for erotic justice.\nThis Handbook surveys the state of the discipline and offers an examination and discussion of emerging, controversial and cutting edge areas. It is an essential reference for academics and researchers in the fields of sexuality studies, sexual health and human rights, and offers key reading for more advanced students.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:651c95a741ef5bf274e04e92d50eae15279fc886","amp;dn":"Routledge+Handbook+of+Sexuality%2C+Health+and+Rights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"651c95a741ef5bf274e04e92d50eae15279fc886","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,28,149,167,65,239,91,242,116,224,78,146,213,14,174,21,39,159,200,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
