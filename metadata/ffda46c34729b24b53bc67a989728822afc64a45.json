These include full-throttle live recordings from Barrowlands, Glasgow in 1987 and The Pogues featuring Joe Strummer from the Forum in London, December 1991 where they perform Clash favourites ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLondon CallingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Fought The LawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The box set rounds off with live tracks from The PoguesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ triumphant reunion shows at Brixton running up to Christmas 2001.\n\nIncluding original songs never before released and covers such as the LovinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ SpoonfulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDo You Believe In MagicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Barry McGuireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEve of DestructionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, The FacesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMaggie MayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ plus more traditional fare like Ewan MacCollÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHot AshphaltÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNorth Sea HolesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, this collection presents a true alternative picture of The PoguesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ irrepressible career, an extraordinarily rich addendum to their already available recorded works.\n\nCurrently on tour in America, The Pogues are already scheduled to play a number of major festivals this summer including IrelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Oxegen Festival and T In the Park in July and the V Festivals in August 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n1.
