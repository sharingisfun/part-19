A highlight of the great British seaside holiday from the 1820s until the early 1960s - and open to all - they were 'the people's liners'.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3753Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.63 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:571a9809c0321e013ba8ebd7a7e0560656cac275","amp;dn":"Timeshift.The.Peoples.Liners.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"571a9809c0321e013ba8ebd7a7e0560656cac275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,26,152,9,192,50,30,1,59,168,235,215,167,224,86,6,86,202,194,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
