Pavia, Gary M. Lampman, George S. Kriz\nPublisher: Brooks Cole, 2001, 560pp, 1st ed.\n\nThe best practical organic lab manual.\n\n\nThe authors have organized this organic chemistry text to present two types of techniques, macroscale and microscale, in a coherent manner within the same chapter. They have added chapters on modern instrumental methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, polarimetry, refractometry, and the various types of chromatography. Initial chapters cover lab safety, advance preparation and lab records.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf5bf828ee0f0ef8ab03c087ec3f8900b8de39d","amp;dn":"Pavia+-+Microscale+and+Macroscale+Techniques+in+the+Organic+Labo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf5bf828ee0f0ef8ab03c087ec3f8900b8de39d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,245,191,130,142,224,240,239,138,176,60,8,126,195,248,144,11,141,227,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
