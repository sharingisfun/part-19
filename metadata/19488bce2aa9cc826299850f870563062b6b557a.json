But I still use Windows XP, and, Outlook.  I actually had been using Thunderbird for the last few years but the damned thing hangs up so much that I just threw in the towel.  Genie Outlook Express Backup 6.5 is an extremely simple program that will backup Outlook Express, easily.  Newer versions of this program offer a lot more features, none of which I care about.   There's a keygen included and this thing is so old (circa 2002 or something) that it's certainly no virus threat (I think this thing was released before viruses were invented - not really).  My guess is that this will not work with Outlook from something like Office 2010.  That's my story - if ya' want it, here it is - come and get it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19488bce2aa9cc826299850f870563062b6b557a","amp;dn":"Genie+Outlook+Express+Backup+ver+6.5+w+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19488bce2aa9cc826299850f870563062b6b557a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,72,139,206,42,169,204,130,98,153,133,15,135,5,99,6,43,107,85,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
