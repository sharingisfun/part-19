It was originally developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) and first released in 1983. Four major versions of System V were released, termed Releases 1, 2, 3 and 4. System V Release 4, or SVR4, was commercially the most successful version, being the result of an effort, marketed as Unix System Unification, which solicited the collaboration of the major Unix vendors. It was the source of several common commercial Unix features.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d149b453e2a0ee31f8696bf257e16ceb4582d7d9","amp;dn":"AT%26amp%3BT+UNIX+System+V+Release+4+Version+2.1+%283.5%29+-+DiOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d149b453e2a0ee31f8696bf257e16ceb4582d7d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,73,180,83,226,160,238,49,248,105,107,242,87,225,108,235,69,130,215,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
