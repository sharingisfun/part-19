The place is Diamondback, New Mexico. You are a stranger on the run - without a friend, a gun, or a past. Somewhere in this scruffy frontier outpost are the keys to your survival. And more. When rumors surface of lost Spanish silver, mayhem follows. Can you save a hardscrabble band of pioneers from themselves? Or will you succumb to temptation in a town where you are the only law? The decision is yours. Boisterous, beguiling, and thoroughly interactive, Dust puts you in the middle of the Old West. Amble down Main Street or belly-up to the bar. Battle gunslingers or help Native Americans recover their stolen heritage. Whatever you do is up to you.\n\n\nOne ISO File.  Burn it or mount it and you're set.\n\n\nI uploaded this torrent because it's dang near impossible to find.  I found out about this game through another Cyberflix masterpiece called &quot;Titanic: Adventure Out of Time.&quot;  Check it out if you like this.  Enjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63e233a5bb542e7616cebf0eadcd155ca40113f6","amp;dn":"Dust+a+Tale+of+the+Wired+West","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63e233a5bb542e7616cebf0eadcd155ca40113f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,226,51,165,187,84,46,118,22,206,191,14,173,205,21,92,164,1,19,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
