The notion was to capture something raw and original. He searched for something unpretentious and genuine, yearning to make a film that would stand out from other music documentaries and potentially redefine the genre. Who he found was a band called Electric Apricot; what he achieved was enlightenment. Unexpectedly, in searching for enlightenment, the duality of existence was unveiled.\n\nIn his directorial debut, Primus frontman Les Claypool, has conceived the next cult classic, National Lampoon Presents Electric Apricot: Quest For Festeroo. The documentarian follows the band Electric Apricot as they have been recently offered some opportunities that could potentially break them through to levels beyond their dreams. Following the band into recording their first album, subsequently forcing them to work with their first band psychologist, and eventually going down the road to the Holy Grail of music festivals, Festeroo, this filmtakes an endearing and twisted look at the American cultural phenomenon known as the Jam Band scene.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img292.imageshack.us/img292/9774/eaql9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img292.imageshack.us/img292/9774/eaql9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo: XVID 640x352 29.97fps 1227Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128Kbps\nRuntime: 1:31:58 (hh:mm:ss)\nFilesize: 919mb\n\nthanks to nolifeking for providing the source for this rip\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee223282f5338773a3b52b77e357fc21b79d6654","amp;dn":"National+Lampoon%5C%27s+-+Electric+Apricot+%28Les+Claypool%29%5BDVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee223282f5338773a3b52b77e357fc21b79d6654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,34,50,130,245,51,135,115,163,181,43,119,227,87,252,33,183,157,102,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
