People forget that Young was a jazz drummer at North Texas State University before he became a composer, and was hugely influenced by the large jazz bands of the 50s and 60s throughout his youth. Young himself says that &quot;most of the tracks on the CD were presented as thematic possibilities for the film&quot; and that the film &quot;gave me a chance to pour out music that has been inside of me all these years.&quot;\nFans of smooth jazz, especially that written by aforementioned composers like Mancini, Hefti and Baxter, might find The Rum Diary something of a curio, and those who cannot tolerate non-orchestral scores or anything with a sly sense of humor or an unorthodox instrumental complement will not have a clue what's going on. Personally, I found The Rum Diary to be a superbly eclectic, creative and original score that shows a totally different - and much welcome - side of Christopher Young's musical personality. It's one of the best comedy scores of the year.\n\nTrack Listing:\n01. Volare (Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu) (02:59), 6.91 MB\n02. Rum Diary (02:42), 6.24 MB\n03. Suckfish And Snake (02:32), 5.88 MB\n04.
