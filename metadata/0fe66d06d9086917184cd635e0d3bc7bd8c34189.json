The orgone accumulator is based upon the discoveries of the late Dr. Wilhelm Reich, whose work remains vital and of wide interest. Learn how to concentrate and work with orgone (life) energy using simple, readily available materials. A limitless supply is freely available from the atmosphere. These experimental devices have been shown to stimulate plant growth and human physiology in controlled studies. In this edition, Dr. DeMeo updates information on the construction of orgone energy blankets, shooters, box-type accumulators, bion-packs and draw buckets for atmospheric cleansing, with many instructional diagrams and photographs, and a complete bibliography and resource guide. Over 150 pages, perfectbound with full-color cover featuring the clearly visible blue orgone (life energy) field of an Apollo astronaut on the lunar surface.\n\n1999 Second Revised Edition\n\nWatch on y~o~u~t~u~b~e the movie &quot;Wilhelm Reich and the Orgone Energy&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe66d06d9086917184cd635e0d3bc7bd8c34189","amp;dn":"The+Orgone+Accumulator+Handbook.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe66d06d9086917184cd635e0d3bc7bd8c34189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,230,109,6,217,8,105,23,24,76,214,53,224,211,188,123,216,195,65,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
