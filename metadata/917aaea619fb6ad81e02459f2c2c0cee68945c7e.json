Written by Ed Harris; Full-cast dramatisation.\n\nIt's 1944, and after the British defeat at Dunkirk and the Americans' decision to stay out of the war, we find ourselves at home in bomb-strewn suburbia with Mrs Brown. She is very ordinary, her husband died in the invasion, and now she pushes a tea trolley for the Nazi Military Administration in Whitehall.\n\nMrs Brown wants nothing more than to be a nobody. Determined above all to survive, and to protect her daughter, she never misses an opportunity to go unnoticed. But when she's contacted by the Resistance, will she keep her resolution?\n\nMrs Brown is given a task.\n\nShe will have one week to complete it.\n\nOne week to decide.\n\nOne week to prepare.\n\nOne week to live.\n\n\nJoan Brown ..... Amanda Root\nMaisie Brown..... Ellie Kendrick\nMrs Crace ..... Adjoa Andoh\nMiss Fry ..... Marlene Sidaway\nOberst Vitte ..... Simon Wilson\nGwen Evans ..... Tracy Wiles\nSturmbannfuhrer Smith .....
