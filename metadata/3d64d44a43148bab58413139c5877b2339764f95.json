HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been an eccentric personality figure (yes, his legal name is now Warrior), and while many of his matches werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t great, he was capable of putting together a few classics. His controversial nature led to the release of The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior on DVD a number of years ago from WWE, which painted Warrior in a pretty negative light. While he responded to the documentary in different Ã¢â‚¬Å“shoot styleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ interview forums, he never worked with WWE to share his side of the story. Now, we finally get that story, in a new match compilation that more clearly celebrates the career of the Ultimate Warrior, a 2014 Hall of Famer. Disc 1 of the DVD runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, Disc 2 runs a bit under 2 hours, and Disc 3 runs a bit over 3 hours. Fortunately, Jesse VenturaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commentary is included, and the only notable edits are a few cutaways to crowd shots during moments in which Warrior chokes an opponent with one of his tassles. \n\n DISC 1 \n\n Warriors Back! \n\n Finding Wrestling \n\n The Blade Runners vs. Perry Jackson &amp; Shawn OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly \n UWF Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ April 11, 1986 \n\n Move to WCCW \n\n Dingo Warrior vs. Chris Adams \n WCCW Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ August 8, 1986 \n\n Arrival in WWE \n\n Ultimate Warrior vs. Barry Horowitz \n Wrestling Challenge Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ November 7, 1987 \n\n Ultimate Warrior vs. Steve Lombardi \n Superstars Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ November 14, 1987 \n\n Getting Noticed \n\n Ultimate Warrior vs. Harley Race \n Boston, MA Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ March 5, 1988 \n\n Upgrading Warrior \n\n Weasel Suit Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Bobby Ã¢â‚¬Å“The BrainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Heenan \n Los Angeles, CA Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ July 15, 1988 \n\n Intercontinental Champion \n\n Intercontinental Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. The Honky Tonk Man \n SummerSlam Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ August 29, 1988 \n\n Intercontinental Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Honky Tonk Man \n Philadelphia, PA Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ December 17, 1988 \n\n The Macho Man \n\n WWE Championship and Intercontinental Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Macho Man Randy Savage \n Boston, MA Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ February 11, 1989 \n\n Simply Ravishing \n\n Intercontinental Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude \n SummerSlam Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ August 28, 1989 \n\n Building Momentum \n\n Ultimate Warrior vs. Bob Bradley \n Prime Time Wrestling Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ September 18, 1989 \n\n Ultimate Warrior vs. Brian Costello \n Prime Time Wrestling Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ December 25, 1989 \n\n Ultimate Warrior confronts Andre on Brother Love Show \n Superstars Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ July 29, 1989 \n\n Memories of Andre \n\n Intercontinental Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Andre the Giant \n Madison Square Garden Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ October 28, 1989 \n\n Intercontinental Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Andre the Giant \n Saturday NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Main Event Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ November 25, 1989 \n\n\n\n DISC 2 \n Leading to Toronto \n\n Ultimate Warrior Promo Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crash the PlaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n Superstars Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ March 10, 1990 \n\n Intercontinental Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Mr. Perfect \n Madison Square Garden Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ March 19, 1990 \n\n Running to the Ring \n\n The Ultimate Challenge \n WWE Championship vs. Intercontinental Championship Match \n Hulk Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior \n WrestleMania VI Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ April 1, 1990 \n\n Responsibilities of the Champion \n\n WWE Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Million $ Man Ted DiBiase \n Wrestling Summit Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ April 13, 1990 \n\n WWE Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Ã¢â‚¬Å“RavishingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rick Rude \n Saturday NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Main Event Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ July 28, 1990 \n\n WWE Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Million $ Man Ted DiBiase \n The Main Event Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ November 23, 1990 \n\n WWE Championship Match \n Ultimate Warrior vs. Sgt.
