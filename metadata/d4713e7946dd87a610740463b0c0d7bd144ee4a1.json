The lyrics are somewhat modified from the LP \n\nrelease. \n\nI quite prefer this noisy archive recorded off the radio onto cassette tape \n\nin 1978 to the classic chart busting LP release.  My main reason for this judgement \n\nis that the producer of &quot;Bat out of Hell&quot; is probably playing guitar here....helping \n\nto promote the album.  I've found this recording on line elsewhere but I didn't\n\nfind Todd Rundgren credited with the lead guitar anywhere.\n\n\n\nSO I ASKYA?\n\nIs it Todd or is it not Todd?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4713e7946dd87a610740463b0c0d7bd144ee4a1","amp;dn":"Meatloaf%3B+Bat+Out+of+Hell+%28live+with+Todd+Rundgren%3F%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4713e7946dd87a610740463b0c0d7bd144ee4a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,113,62,121,70,221,135,166,16,116,4,99,176,192,215,189,20,78,228,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
