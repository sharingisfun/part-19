Jewish doctor Henryk Goldszmit, known also as Janusz Korczak, is a man of high principles. He is unafraid of shouting at German officers and frequently has to be persuaded to save his own life. His orphanage, set up in a cramped school in the Warsaw ghetto, provides shelter to 200 homeless children. Putting his experimental educational methods into practice, he installs a kind of children's self-government, whose justice is in a big contrast to what is happening in the outside world. Right in front of the school, dozens of children are dying or being killed every day, and their naked bodies lie on the street unattended. Ghetto's mayor assures Korczak that the orphanages will be saved. Korczak raises food and money for the orphanage from the rich Jews. In the final roundup, he refuses to accept a Swiss passport and boards the train to Treblinka with his orphans. Written by Polish Cinema Database &lt;http://info.fuw.edu.pl/Filmy/&gt;\n\n\nKorczak, is a 1990 film by Andrzej Wajda shot in black-and-white, about Polish-Jewish humanitarian Janusz Korczak. It was screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe epic was bitterly attacked during its Festival screening by some political commentators in France, notably, by virulently anti-Polish Claude Lanzmann, who would prefer to see the Poles being portrayed as the villains. Yet, among its strongest defendants was Marek Edelman, the Polish Jew who survived the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Wajda himself, saw the idea of showing the children being led into the Treblinka gas chambers as repulsing.\n\nCast\n\nWojciech Pszoniak - Henryk Goldszmit vel Janusz Korczak\nEwa Dalkowska - Stefania 'Stefa' Wilczynska\nTeresa Budzisz-Krzyzanowska - Maryna Rogowska-Falska\nMarzena Trybala - Estera\nPiotr Kozlowski - Heniek\nZbigniew Zamachowski - Ichak Szulc\nJan Peszek - Max Bauer\nAleksander Bardini - Adam CzerniakÃƒÂ³w\nMaria ChwalibÃƒÂ³g - CzerniakÃƒÂ³w's wife\nAndrzej Kopiczynski - Dyrektor w Polskim Radiu\nKrystyna Zachwatowicz - Szloma's mother\nJerzy Zass - German wachman on the bridge\nWojciech Klata - Szloma\nMichal Staszczak - JÃƒÂ³zek\nAgnieszka KrukÃƒÂ³wna - Ewka (as Agnieszka Kruk)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:002df53452f03337784363536562fce837b92f3d","amp;dn":"Korczak+%5B1990%5D+Polish+Holocaust+Drama+%5BEnglish+Subtitles%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"002df53452f03337784363536562fce837b92f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,45,245,52,82,240,51,55,120,67,99,83,101,98,252,232,55,185,47,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
