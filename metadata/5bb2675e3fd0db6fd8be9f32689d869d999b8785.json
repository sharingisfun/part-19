It cemented the band's reputation among critics, and is still rated by many as one of the most important albums ever.  In 2006, the writers of NME declared the album the greatest British album of all time.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide - Since the Stone Roses were the nominal leaders of Britain's &quot;Madchester&quot; scene -- an indie rock phenomenon that fused guitar pop with drug-fueled rave and dance culture -- it's rather ironic that their eponymous debut only hints at dance music. What made the Stone Roses important was how they welcomed dance and pop together, treating them as if they were the same beast. Equally important was the Roses' cool, detached arrogance, which was personified by Ian Brown's nonchalant vocals. Brown's effortless malevolence is brought to life with songs that equal both his sentiments and his voice -- &quot;I Wanna Be Adored,&quot; with its creeping bassline and waves of cool guitar hooks, doesn't demand adoration, it just expects it. Similarly, Brown can claim &quot;I Am the Resurrection&quot; and lie back, as if there were no room for debate. But the key to The Stone Roses is John Squire's layers of simple, exceedingly catchy hooks and how the rhythm section of Reni and Mani  always imply dance rhythms without overtly going into the disco. On &quot;She Bangs the Drums&quot; and &quot;Elephant Stone,&quot; the hooks wind into the rhythm inseparably -- the '60s hooks and the rolling beats manage to convey the colorful, neo-psychedelic world of acid house. Squire's riffs are bright and catchy, recalling the British Invasion while suggesting the future with their phased, echoey effects. The Stone Roses was a two-fold revolution -- it brought dance music to an audience that was previously obsessed with droning guitars, while it revived the concept of classic pop songwriting, and the repercussions of its achievement could be heard throughout the '90s, even if the Stone Roses could never achieve this level of achievement again.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] I Wanna Be Adored\n[02] She Bangs The Drums\n[03] Waterfall\n[04] Don't Stop\n[05] Bye Bye Badman\n[06] Elizabeth My Dear\n[07] (Song For My) Sugar Spun Sister\n[08] Made Of Stone\n[09] Shoot You Down\n[10] This Is The One\n[11] I Am The Resurrection\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 00h:48m:45s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 304mb (Including FLACs, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; July 1989\nRecord Company\t&gt; Silverstone Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stone_Roses \n\t&gt; http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/lyrics \n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/thestoneroses \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt;[Waterfall]\n\t&gt;[I Wanna Be Adored]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb2675e3fd0db6fd8be9f32689d869d999b8785","amp;dn":"%5B1989%5D+The+Stone+Roses+-+The+Stone+Roses+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb2675e3fd0db6fd8be9f32689d869d999b8785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,178,103,94,63,208,219,111,216,190,159,50,104,157,134,157,153,155,135,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
