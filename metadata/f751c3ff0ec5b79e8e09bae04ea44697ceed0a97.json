On May 1 and May 2, 1996, Mike Caro -- one of the world's foremost authorities on poker strategy, psychology, and statistics -- and 63 poker notables, partipated in an historic, unpublicized, multiple-camera filming.  The result is this powerful full-color, scientific course that demonstrates how you can use your opponent's gestures, words, and body language to win all their money.  (1996) Editor note:  This is one of the most powerful and interesting poker videos that I have ever viewed. \n\n------------\n\n\nhttp://www.fulltiltpoker.com/?aff=503&amp;code=~1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f751c3ff0ec5b79e8e09bae04ea44697ceed0a97","amp;dn":"Mike+Caro+-+Pro+Poker+Tells+Video.asf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f751c3ff0ec5b79e8e09bae04ea44697ceed0a97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,81,195,255,14,197,183,158,142,9,186,224,78,164,70,151,206,237,10,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
