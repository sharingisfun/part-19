The child of very musical parents, she's inherited their genes, but added her individuality, which can move from the pop-blues of Sam Cooke's &quot;You Were Made for Me&quot; (one of two Cooke songs here, both with real identity) to the New Orleans style of &quot;Juneteenth Jamboree.&quot; Interesting touches in the arrangements help the album, too, such as the mandolin on &quot;Sad Lover Blues&quot; (it features elsewhere, too) or the pedal steel that colors &quot;The Late, Late Show.&quot; Russell isn't a belter. She prefers to shade her material and does it well. There are a few surprising choices, the most obvious being &quot;New Speedway Boogie,&quot; the cover of a Grateful Dead song that more or less works (they were so idiosyncratic that anything written specifically for them seems a little misplaced done by anyone else), but it's a joy to hear someone singing outside the usual box of standards. Whether she'll become a major star remains in the lap of the gods. But she's definitely one of the more adventurous -- and friendly -- singers mining the seam of jazz-blues.
