Suddenly Benson's backup group - same as that of Uptown, with Benny Green added on trombone now and then - has found its bearings and apropos to the title, they can cook, even sizzle.  The effect upon Benson's own playing is striking; with something to react against, his sheer ability to swing advances into the realm of awesome.  The rapid-fire work on &quot;The Cooker&quot; and &quot;Ready And Able&quot; will make you gasp.  Only one vocal here, an exuberant &quot;All Of Me.&quot; [ In mid-2001 Columbia/Legacy reissued this 1966 classic, along with It's Uptown, recorded only several months earlier.  Four bonus tracks include a (previously unreleased) doo wop vocal rendition of Little Willie John's &quot;Let Them Talk&quot; and two Benson originals that are pure rock-n-roll: &quot;The Man from Toledo&quot; and &quot;Goodnight. &quot; Two of the bonus cuts are preceded by control-booth comments from the session's legendary producer, John Hammond. ] ~ Richard S.
