When she was still a child, Lucy Nelson had her alcoholic \nfailure of a father thrown in jail. Ever since then she has been trying to \nreform the men around her, even if that ultimately means destroying herself in \nthe process. With his unerring portraits of Lucy and her hapless, childlike \nhusband, Roy, Roth has created an uncompromising work of fictional realism, a \nvision of provincial American piety, yearning, and discontent that is at once \npitiless and compassionate. \n\nFrom Wiki:\n\n...While at Chicago, Roth met the novelist Saul Bellow, as well as Margaret \nMartinson, who became his first wife. Their separation in 1963, along with \nMartinson's death in a car crash in 1968, left a lasting mark on Roth's \nliterary output. Specifically, Martinson was the inspiration for female \ncharacters in several of Roth's novels, including Lucy Nelson in When She Was \nGood, and Maureen Tarnopol in My Life As a Man\n\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n&gt;&gt;When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93fbd319bd894fbebd29c3bdeeb3afc5367e8dba","amp;dn":"WHEN+SHE+WAS+GOOD+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+Tanya+Eby+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93fbd319bd894fbebd29c3bdeeb3afc5367e8dba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,251,211,25,189,137,79,190,189,41,195,189,238,179,175,197,54,126,141,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
