Though Schnittke's quartets number only four compared to Shostakovich's 15, they still offer snapshots of the eclectic composer's frame of mind at different points along his evolution. At various times, Schnittke's writing adheres to the ideals of the Second Viennese School or to more tonal contributions. Schnittke was also a master of style imitation, particularly incorporating Baroque-style counterpoint and even a direct quote from Beethoven's Grosse Fugue. The final quartet, the only one written after a series of strokes began to plague the composer, is a dire, dark, gloomy work that starkly portrays the composer's inevitable physical decline. Because of the sometimes harsh, abrasive chromaticism and atonality, Schnittke's quartets are often unduly neglected. On this ATMA Classique disc, the Quatuor Molinari brings an uncommonly rich, inviting sound quality to these four quartets. Coupled with superb (and rarely heard) intonation, this has the welcome effect of mellowing some of the harshness without robbing the quartets of their essence. Following their stated mission of performing 20th and 21st century compositions, Molinari presents a confidently musical, well-balanced, and captivating performance of four quartets that deserve much more attention and appreciation. A welcome addition to any collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e5557e7e9cd274b3907d4888a8084be400b4ee6","amp;dn":"Alfred+Schnittke+-+Complete+String+Quartets+24bit+96khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e5557e7e9cd274b3907d4888a8084be400b4ee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,85,87,231,233,205,39,75,57,7,212,136,138,128,132,190,64,11,78,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
