If you are not a fan of Godot yet, I recommend you d/l the Michael Lindsay-Hogg production: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5022917/%5B2001%5D_Waiting_for_Godot_-_Michael_Lindsay-Hogg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5022917/%5B2001%5D_Waiting_for_Godot_-_Michael_Lindsay-Hogg&lt;/a&gt;\nThis copy of the kinny is a rare curiosity, rumored about but unavailable for years.
