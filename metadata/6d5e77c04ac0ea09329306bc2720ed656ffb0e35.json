Elfrink revealed that a Miami clinic, Biogenesis, had been supplying illegal performance enhancing drugs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ PEDs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to many of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top baseball stars. One name stood out among all the others: Alex Rodriguez, the highest-earning player in the game.\n\nOver the next year and more the story would unravel with incredible details about tanning salon robberies, coded text messages, and furtive steroid injections in the menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s room. In late 2013 Alex Rodriguez would be hit with the longest suspension in MLB history, prompting an ugly fight between him and top league brass. Fourteen other players, including superstar Ryan Braun, were also given shorter suspensions. Tony Bosch, BiogenesisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founder, would appear on 60 Minutes in an effort to tell his side of the story.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already been reported in the press has been fascinating; but the story behind the headlines that Elfrink and Newsday reporter Gus Garcia-Roberts have unearthed is even more dramatic and full of new, shocking details. Using exclusive documents, never-before-reported records and interviews with top sources, this book takes the reader inside drug deals, athletesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mansions, and confidential suspension hearings to tell the true story behind the sportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuing PED crisis.\n\nBoth news-breaking sports journalism and wild South Florida noir, Blood Sport is simultaneously a revelatory record of the steroid and PED eraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuing evolution and a call to arms for how to end it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this time, for good.
