By 1959, McNally and Pender were working together as a duet; later in the year, Jackson joined as the lead vocalist. After drummer Norman McGarry left the Searchers he was replaced by Chris Crummy, who quickly renamed himself Chris Curtis. Other changes were in the works as Jackson built and learned to play a customized bass guitar. Learning his new job on the four-stringed instrument proved too difficult to permit him to continue singing lead, and McNally and Pender brought in a fifth member, Johnny Sandon (born Billy Beck). Johnny Sandon &amp; the Searchers lasted from 1960 through February of 1962, and were extremely popular on the dance hall and club circuit in Liverpool. Sandon cut out for a career on his own, with another band called the Remo Four in early 1962.\n\nMeanwhile, the Searchers, now a quartet with Jackson once again lead singer, became one of the top acts on the Liverpool band scene, playing textured renditions of American R&amp;B, rock &amp; roll, country, soul, and rockabilly. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jifixqr5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jifixqr5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review of 1972 Version:\n\nIf you actually find this record, consider yourself lucky. Cut by the band with their longest-standing lineup (drummer Billy Adamson replacing Chris Curtis), the material still sings, though the remakes of the early hits lacks the crispness and punch of the originals. And it features their early-'70s bid for chart success, &quot;Desdemona.&quot; \n\nTrack List:\n\n01. Sugar And Spice\n02. Don't Throw Your Love Away\n03. Farmer John\n04. Come On Back To Me\n05. When You Walk In The Room\n06. Needles And Pins\n07. Desdemona\n08. Goodbye My Love\n09. Love Potion Number Nine\n10. Sweets For  My Sweet\n11. Take Me For What I'm Worth\n12. What Have They Done To The Rain?\n\nBonus Tracks:\n\n13. The World Is Waiting For Tomorrow\n14. Love Is Everywhere\n15. And A Button\n16. Sing Singer Sing\n17. Vahevala\n18. Madman\n19.
