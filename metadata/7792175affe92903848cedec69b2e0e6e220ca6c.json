But, I would&amp;#039;ve used the actual story of his life instead of using a fictional character to depict his life. Only a suggestion though Richard. But besides that, it is a great bio that has charm and laughs along the way (that later reminded me of Andy Kaufman&amp;#039;s Man on the Moon). Trivia note- Pryor wrote, produced, directed (his first real film, though he directed Richard Pryor Here and Now) and starred in this film, which would be his last film to have writer, producer and director on his credits (he now has MS). A- \n\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; Please seed AT LEAST 2 copies!\n\n\nThanks in advance! :)\n\nTuberok","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7792175affe92903848cedec69b2e0e6e220ca6c","amp;dn":"JoJo+Dancer-+Richard+Pryor+Autobiography+-+Please+Seed+-+9-16-07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7792175affe92903848cedec69b2e0e6e220ca6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,146,23,90,255,233,41,3,132,140,237,236,105,178,224,230,226,32,202,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
