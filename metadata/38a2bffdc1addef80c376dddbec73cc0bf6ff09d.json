The on-screen image labels the controllers with their current parameters, providing visual reminders.\n\nCreative Workflow:\n\n-Capture your ideas quickly and make music - without getting bogged down with technical jargon and complicated steps.\n\n-Record vocals, guitar or any audio input source. Ignite supports stereo audio recording and playback using ASIO, Core Audio and WASAPI audio interfaces.\n\n-Individual musical ideas are captured as phrases and are placed in the Arranger. \n\n-The Arranger is an organic &quot;stage&quot; where you can organize your music ideas and phrases in whatever way make sense to you.\n\n-Clips can be any length, and don't have to be aligned into a pre-determined structure (such as tracks and lanes). Multiple Clips can be played back together, or even grouped to create more complex phrases and song sections.\n\n-Clips and Multi-Clips can be quickly duplicated in the Arranger using a few simple commands, making it easier to experiment and audition new ideas.\n\nSuperior AIR Instrument Sounds:\n\n-Included with Ignite are over 275 remarkable instrument sounds developed by AIR Music Technology. This international team also created the acclaimed Hybrid, Strike, Transfer, Structure, and Velvet instruments for Pro Tools - the industry-standard professional music and audio workstation.\n\n-Instruments include keyboards, drums, percussion, basses, guitars, synths, strings, brass, and woodwinds.\n\nUPLOADER NOTE: This is an OEM software provided with many M-AUDIO MIDI instruments, originally for the download from the authorÃ‚Â´s web you would need an valid S/N of an NEW M-audio instrument.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38a2bffdc1addef80c376dddbec73cc0bf6ff09d","amp;dn":"Ignite+1.3.1+FULL+Air+Music+Technology-+MAC+OSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38a2bffdc1addef80c376dddbec73cc0bf6ff09d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,162,191,253,193,173,222,248,12,55,109,221,190,199,60,192,191,111,240,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
