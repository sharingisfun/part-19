The album debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart for five weeks after its release. On 10 January 2010 the album returned to number two extending its stay at the runner-up spot to six non-consecutive weeks. The following week it reached its new peak position of number one for two consecutive weeks. So far it has spent sixty-five consecutive weeks within the top forty and thirty-three of those inside the top ten. It also peaked at number two for six weeks on the Irish Albums Chart.  The album was a main contender for the 2009 Mercury Prize and received largely positive reviews from music critics. Additionally, it won the MasterCard British Album award at the 2010 BRIT Awards. Lungs has sold more than three million copies worldwide.\nFlorence and the Machine recorded Lungs in the United Kingdom with four different producersÃ¢â‚¬â€Paul Epworth (who has previously worked with several other British artists, including Bloc Party, MaxÃƒÂ¯mo Park and Kate Nash), James Ford (who is part of the electro group Simian Mobile Disco), Stephen Mackey (former member of Pulp) and newcomer Charlie Hugall. Most of the songs on the album were mixed by Cenzo Townshend.[1] The album is noted for having a much more expansive production than Florence and the Machine's previously recorded demos.  Several songs on Lungs are about violence and death. When questioned about this by the NME, lead singer Florence Welch responded: &quot;Well, what other subject is there? I remember realising that my parents were going to die and weeping. Weeping as if my father had actually died.&quot;\nThe lead single from Lungs, &quot;Kiss with a Fist&quot;, was released before the final recording of the album, on 9 June 2008, peaking at number fifty-one on the UK Singles Chart. The song was used in the American comedy horror film Jennifer's Body[2] and in the British comedy film St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold,[3] both from 2009. &quot;Dog Days Are Over&quot;, the second single, was released on 1 December 2008 and reached number twenty-three on the UK Singles Chart on 10 January 2010. The song was used in the eighth episode of the third series of the BAFTA-winning teen drama Skins,[4] originally aired on 12 March 2009, as well as in the second episode of the American comedy-drama television series The Unusuals, titled &quot;Boorland Day&quot; and broadcast 15 April 2009.[5] It was also featured in the theatrical trailer for the 2010 film Eat Pray Love, starring Julia Roberts.[6] The Yeasayer remix of &quot;Dog Days Are Over&quot;, which is included on Between Two Lungs, was released on 12 October 2010 via iTunes.[7]  As a precursor to the album's July 2009 release, &quot;Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)&quot; was released as the album's third single on 22 June 2009. It received a considerably greater amount of airplay in comparison to the two earlier singles, and subsequently debuted at number twelve on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Drumming Song&quot; was released as the album's fourth single on 7 September 2009, reaching number fifty-four in the UK.  &quot;You've Got the Love&quot; was the fifth single to be released from the album and reached a new peak of number five on the UK Singles Chart on 10 January 2010. The song also spawned a spin-off single called &quot;You Got the Dirtee Love&quot;, a mash-up of Welch and English rapper Dizzee Rascal's &quot;Dirtee Cash&quot;, which they performed together at the 2010 BRIT Awards. The single was released on 17 February 2010, one day after the BRITs performance\n\nCD-01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lungs - Track Listings\n\n[01] Dog Days Are Over\n[02] Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\n[03] I'm Not Calling You A Liar\n[04] Howl\n[05] Kiss With A Fist\n[06] Girl With One Eye\n[07] Drumming Song\n[08] Between Two Lungs\n[09] Cosmic Love\n[10] My Boy Builds Coffins\n[11] Hurricane Drunk\n[12] Blinding\n[13] You've Got The Love\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:46m:09s\n\nCD-02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Live At Abbey Road - Track Listings\n\n[01] Between Two Lungs\n[02] Kiss with a Fist\n[03] Hurricane Drunk\n[04] Cosmic Love\n[05] Oh!
