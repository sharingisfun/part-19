This volume also details new methods of analyzing the genetic and geographic data of pathogens to reconstruct their evolution and to identify the migration routes through which the strains spread regionally and internationally.\n\nThis book will fill the existing gap in covering the bioinformatics aspects of infectious diseases and will complement numerous successful bioinformatics texts devoted to the mainstream of human genetics and cancer.\n\n\nIn this book, Vitali Sintchenko brings together a collection of state-of-the-art reviews of informatics applications aiming to improve the diagnosis, prevention, treatment and control of infectious diseases. In response to the need for computational biology techniques geared towards clinical medicine, this volume covers the emerging domains of translational bioinformatics, genomics enabled decision support, intelligent design of vaccines and antimicrobial drugs as well as new types of biosurveillance. This book is written by a diverse, international group of experts in the field and provides clinicians, pathologists, biomedical researchers and informaticians with an essential resource that offers also a fascinating glimpse into the future of this dynamic field.\n\nVitali Sintchenko (MBBS, PhD, FRCPA, FACHI) is a clinical microbiologist and informatician with the Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Australia.\nAbout the Author\n\nVitali Sintchenko (MBBS, PhD, FRCPA, FACHI) is a clinical microbiologist and informatician with the Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Australia.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 434 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (December 17, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1441913262\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1441913265","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9402ec7eb34ca9d1b0061e624f77dacb02522f0e","amp;dn":"Infectious+Disease+Informatics+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9402ec7eb34ca9d1b0061e624f77dacb02522f0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,2,236,126,179,76,169,209,176,6,30,98,79,119,218,203,2,82,47,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
