The ways in which dysfunction in the soft tissue mirrors deeper pathology of both mind and body, and the ways in which it influences such pathology, directly or reflexly, are profoundly important.\nA factor common to the various reflex systems (such as acupuncture points, Chapman's neurolymphatic reflexes, myofascial trigger points etc.) seems to be their siting in fascial tissue. The stresses and strains produced in this ubiquitous tissue produce definite patterns, many of which are related to lines of postural stress, which are fairly uniform in man. Andrew Taylor Still, the founder of osteopathic medicine, was clearly prophetic when he stated that the fascia is the place to look for the cause of disease, and the place to begin the action of remedies. Palpable tender areas of dysfunction, which often display measurable changes of cutaneous electrical potential, may be regarded as common to all these systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21c127ed93135f612b4d59c6ba0834ddb2df0ddf","amp;dn":"Chaitow+1987+Soft+Tissue+Manipulation+3rd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21c127ed93135f612b4d59c6ba0834ddb2df0ddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,193,39,237,147,19,95,97,43,77,89,198,186,8,52,221,178,223,13,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
