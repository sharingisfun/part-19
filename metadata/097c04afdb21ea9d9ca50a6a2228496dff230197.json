Simpson (1995) which presents a timely dossier containing exhaustively researched and heavily annotated new information on O.J. and Nicole Simpson&amp;#039;s alleged ties to organized crime and drug dealing. Many may still remember the highly televized O.J. Simpson trial which hit record viewing rates all around USA and the world. Although the 1995 criminal trial of O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman has been called a &quot;a great trash novel come to life,&quot; no one can deny the pull it had on the American public. If the early reports of the murder of the wife of the ex-NFL football star hadn&amp;#039;t caught people&amp;#039;s full attention, the 133 days of televised courtroom testimony surely turned countless viewers into Simpson trial junkies. Even foreign leaders such as Margaret Thatcher and Boris Yeltsin eagerly gossiped about the trial. In this unique report the author links O.J., Goldman, and Nicole as being cocaine dealers for the Mafia and how the CIA was involved from behind. Citing the earlier Catspaw murders as a blueprint for many aspects of the vicious attack on Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Constantine presents many under-reported and fascinating connections which will never allow the reader to view this case the same way again. 40 pages. A must read from everyone.\n\nAdditional info on the O.J. case: http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/simpson.htm\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:097c04afdb21ea9d9ca50a6a2228496dff230197","amp;dn":"Constantine-Hollywood+Mob+Connection%2CCIA%26O.J.+Simpson%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"097c04afdb21ea9d9ca50a6a2228496dff230197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,124,4,175,219,33,234,157,156,165,10,106,34,40,73,109,255,35,1,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
