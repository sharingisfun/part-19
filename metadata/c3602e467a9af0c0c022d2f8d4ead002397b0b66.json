Mearsheimer and Prof. Stephen M. Walt\n\nWhat is the impact of the Israel lobby on U.S. foreign policyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and is it in AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s national interest?\nPublishers Weekly\nExpanding on their notorious 2006 article in the London Review of Books, the authors increase the megatonnage of their explosive claims about the malign influence of the pro-Israel lobby on the U.S. government. Mearsheimer and Walt, political scientists at the University of Chicago and Harvard, respectively, survey a wide coalition of pro-Israel groups and individuals, including American Jewish organizations and political donors, Christian fundamentalists, neo-con officials in the executive branch, media pundits who smear critics of Israel as anti-Semites and the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, which they characterize as having an &quot;almost unchallenged hold on Congress.&quot; This lobby, they contend, has pressured the U.S. government into Middle East policies that are strategically and morally unjustifiable: lavish financial subsidies for Israel despite its occupation of Palestinian territories; needless American confrontations with Israel's foes Syria and Iran; uncritical support of Israel's 2006 bombing of Lebanon, which &quot;violated the laws of war&quot;; and the Iraq war, which &quot;almost certainly would not have occurred had [the Israel lobby] been absent.&quot; The authors disavow conspiracy mongering, noting that the lobby's activities constitute legitimate, if misguided, interest-group politics, &quot;as American as apple pie.&quot; Considering the authors' academic credentials and the careful reasoning and meticulous documentation with which they support their claims, the book is bound to rekindle the controversy.
