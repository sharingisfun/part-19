It was released in 1999, and has no protection what-so-ever.\n\nI had been searching torrents for ages and to no avail, but eventually found a copy on a recently deceased website a while ago. I thought it was time I gave back to the community.\n\nIf you're a fan of retro games, or have ever played this, then I hope you enjoy it. I had it as a child and trying to play in Polish was highly disappointing.\n\nOnly needs Daemon Tools, or a similar program, to mount and install.\n\nPlease comment, as I hope I'm doing this right.\n\nThankyou.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/581203-ancient-conquest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/581203-ancient-conquest&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efa5534020e6e62f57e44003b647a269f9233d8e","amp;dn":"Ancient+Conquest.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efa5534020e6e62f57e44003b647a269f9233d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,165,83,64,32,230,230,47,87,228,64,3,182,71,162,105,249,35,61,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
