As far as I'm concerned, this is by far one of the best American prog bands ever. There's a reason for that: while many other American prog bands of the era seem watered down, like adding bar-band influences or AOR with their music, CATHEDRAL completely avoided that, and sounds very much like British prog rock. The music is absolutely loaded with Mellotron, with lots of Rickenbacker bass. And if any of this sounds a bit familiar, well, the music sounds a lot like highly acclaimed '90s Swedish prog band ANGLAGARD, except of course, the vocals are much more dominant (in ordinary English), and none of that Scadinavian/Nordic influences, obviously...&quot;\n(Ben Miler, AKA: Proghead / progarchives.com)\n\nIf you want to know where Anglagard got their major inspiration from, listen to this album.\n\nFor further infos see enlosed booklet\nor go to &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=412&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=412&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59bec46236fac920baea3c9569bcbe5b58e2aa00","amp;dn":"Cathedral+-+1978+-+Stained+Glass+Stories+%28Symphonic+Prog%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59bec46236fac920baea3c9569bcbe5b58e2aa00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,190,196,98,54,250,201,32,186,234,60,149,105,188,190,91,88,226,170,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
