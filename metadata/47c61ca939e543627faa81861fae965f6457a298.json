Released in February 2007, the single became Bryan's first chart entry, spending more than thirty weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, where it reached a peak of #5. The single also crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, reaching a peak of #59.\n\nThe song is part of the tracklist for Now That's What I Call Country.\n\nThe song is an up-tempo, country-rock song, telling of a man who has just woken up after a night of drinking at a bar, unable to remember what he had been doing in the bar, and unaware of how he arrived home. In an attempt to find out what happened, he asks several of his friends, all of whom tell him that he began drinking heavily upon seeing his former lover with another man.\n\nRegarding the song, Bryan has said: &quot;It's one of those songs that people just seem to relate to when they hear it. It's about waking up in a rocking chair somewhere and wondering what in the heck went on the night before. It's about seeing your ex in a bar with someone new... We've all been there and had those kinds of experiences.&quot;\n\nKevin John Coyne, reviewing the song for Country Universe, gave it a B rating. He said the only problem with the song is the production. He then goes on to say that &quot;it tries a little too hard to show 'attitude', and ends up making BryanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocal sound more timid than it actually is.&quot;\n\n&quot;All My Friends Say&quot; debuted at #59 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of February 10, 2007. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of August 18, 2007, the song debuted at #90.\n\nI'll Stay Me is the debut album of American country music artist Luke Bryan. The album was released in the United States on August 14, 2007 on Capitol Records Nashville. Its debut single, &quot;All My Friends Say&quot;, reached #5 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs  charts in late 2007. &quot;We Rode in Trucks&quot; and &quot;Country Man&quot; have also been released from this album, and have both charted on the country charts. Bryan co-wrote 10 of the 11 songs on the album.\n\nThomas Luther &quot;Luke&quot; Bryan (born July 17, 1976, in Leesburg, Georgia) is an American country music artist.
