After Mr First starts showing the residents Chaplinesque silent films on his cinematograph, the town's wild inhabitants are tamed by the images on the silver screen, trading saloons and brawls for glasses of milk and moving pictures.\n\nBeautiful dancer Diane falls for First, and so he ends up making a few enemies, including Diane's many other admirers, and the barman who is threatened by the new competition for &quot;entertainment&quot;.\n\nIn many ways, the film is a comedy critique of the wild west myth, and takes the whole thing full circle. Just as Buffalo Bill mythologized his exploits, and later Hollywood elaborated the image, so in this way you have a Soviet film (i.e. the other side of the Cold War) deconstructing it, and satirizing it, both through the film, and the &quot;film within film&quot; that Johnny First shows. It is a self-reflexive fable documenting its own evolution.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard04-9-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard04-9-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard06-8-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard06-8-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard05-8-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard05-8-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard03-9-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard03-9-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard02-9-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard02-9-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard01-9-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/Clipboard01-9-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----my rip----\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~ Chelovek s bulvara Kaputsinov.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,289,650,176                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:33:19                \n\nFrame Count:....................................139959             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................672                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................416                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.615                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1702                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.244&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2     \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
