Studios starting in 2013, the new monthly on-going series Hellraiser - The Dark Watch is written by Clive Barker and Brandon Seifert. While it is considered a relaunch of the franchise, it is in fact a continuation of the previous Hellraiser series which ended with issue #20.\n\nAs promised, Clive Barker did not only return to the Hellraiser universe, he re-imagined it! Nothing is as simple as it seems ? the old ways have been destroyed and a dangerous new world lies in its wake. Where are Elliott Spencer and Kirsty Cotton? Who will rule and who will serve?\n\nRising star Brandon Seifert (WITCH DOCTOR, HELLRAISER: THE ROAD BELOW) joins forces with the legendary Clive Barker, with art by Tom Garcia, to begin this amazing new chapter in the history of one of horror?s greatest franchises.
