The band rebounded by recruiting vocalistBrian Johnson (a Scott favourite) and releasing their best-selling album ever, BACK IN BLACK. BONFIRE is a five-disc tribute to the pugnacious and raspy-voiced Scott, overflowing with the bare-fisted riffs and ribald lyrics that were the trademark of his edition of the band. Recorded live at New York's Atlantic Studios, Disc 1 was originally a promotionalonly release that's been bootlegged countless times over the years. All thriller, no filler, this recording overflows with plenty of classics ranging from the band's cheeky tribute to venereal disease (&quot;The Clap&quot;) to the tale of an over-sexed Rubenesque female fan (&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot;.) Discs Twoand Three are an expanded version of the soundtrack to the 1980 concert film &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;. Recorded before a French audience, AC/DC's in-your-face performance transcended any cultural differences and the audience often sang along despite language barriers. Entitled VOLTS, Disc Four consists of work-in-process studio recordings of material such as &quot;Touch Too Much&quot; and &quot;Get It Hot&quot; with different lyrics than the finished versions. The inclusion of the slow blues of &quot;Ride On&quot; shows another side to AC/DC often lost among the lascivious offerings of &quot;Beatin' Around The Bush&quot; and &quot;She's Got Balls&quot;. A re-mastered version of BACK IN BLACK completes this set marking the end of one era and the beginning of another.\n\n\nCountry: Australia\nGenre: Hard Rock\nQuality: 320 kbps\nTracklist:\nAlbum List:\n\n(2003) AC/DC - Bonfire (5CD Box) \n\nDisc 1 - Live From The Atlantic Studios\n\n01 - Live Wire.mp3\n02 - Problem Child.mp3\n03 - High Voltage.mp3\n04 - Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be.mp3\n05 - Dog Eat Dog.mp3\n06 - The Jack.mp3\n07 - Whole Lotta Rosie.mp3\n08 - Rocker.mp3\n\nDisc 2 - Let There Be Rock The Movie - Live In Paris Disc 1\n\n01 - Live Wire.mp3\n02 - Shot Down in Flames.mp3\n03 - Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be.mp3\n04 - Sin City.mp3\n05 - Walk All Over You.mp3\n06 - Bad Boy Boogie.mp3\n\nDisc 3 - Let There Be Rock The Movie - Live In Paris Disc 2\n\n01 - The Jack.mp3\n02 - Highway to Hell.mp3\n03 - Girls Got Rhythm.mp3\n04 - High Voltage.mp3\n05 - Whole Lotta Rosie.mp3\n06 - Rocker.mp3\n07 - T.N.T..mp3\n08 - Let There Be Rock.mp3\nDisc 4 - Volts\n01 - Dirty Eyes.mp3\n02 - Touch Too Much (Alt.
