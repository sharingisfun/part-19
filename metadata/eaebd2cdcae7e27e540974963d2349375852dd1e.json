Their musical style has changed several times since the band's origin in the early 1980s. Starting out as a speed metal band, Voivod have added a mix of progressive metal and thrash metal to create their own unique metal style.\n\nSince their debut record in 1984, Voivod have released eleven studio albums as well as one EP, one live album, two compilations, seven demos and one DVD featuring a live concert. The band found mainstream success in the late 1980s with the album Nothingface (1989), which was the first Voivod album to enter the Billboard 200 charts, peaking at number 114. Voivod's most recent studio album is 2013's Target Earth, their only album with the lineup of Snake (vocals), Chewy (guitar), Blacky (bass) and Away (drums).\n\nCanadian metal innovators VOIVOD recently recorded a new song for a split seven-inch vinyl release with Century Media labelmates AT THE GATES.\n The collector's item will be available in stores April 7 and you can check out the VOIVOD track, &quot;We Are Connected&quot;,\n.\n\nVOIVOD and NAPALM DEATH will join forces for a North American tour, aptly dubbed &quot;Through Space And Grind&quot;, in January/February.\n\nThe track starts off speedily, with a double time drum beat supporting slithering six-string leads and Snake's twisting vocal lines. As could be imagined, the group shift into various other patterns, from a stormy seaside waltz to discordant, pinch harmonic-heavy stomps. The psyche-altering video complements the arrangement with an assortment of multi-coloured, kaleidoscopic scenes.
