It avoids analytical treatment of the numerous statistical process control techniques to concentrate on the practical problems involved. A practical approach is taken, making it relevant in virtually all manufacturing and process industries.\n\nThere is currently no information readily available to practising engineers or students that discusses the real problems and such material is long overdue. \n\nAn indispensable guide for all those involved in process control\nIncludes equipment specification, troubleshooting, system specification and design\nProvided with guidelines of HOW TO and HOW NOT TO install process control","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cc2d12fea904fc1fa52e0438cd3cbbb43b6e082","amp;dn":"Practical+Process+Control+-+A+M+Seal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cc2d12fea904fc1fa52e0438cd3cbbb43b6e082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,194,209,47,234,144,79,193,250,82,224,67,140,211,203,187,67,182,224,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
