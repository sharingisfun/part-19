Because of inconsistencies with other stories, it has been argued that these stories actually feature an alternate Silver Surfer from a parallel Earth. This miniseries won the Eisner Award for best finite/limited series in 1989.\n\nGalactus has converted humanity into his followers, and he's leading them to their doom! The planet-devouring demigod's only challenger is the hero he himself trapped on Earth: the Silver Surfer. It's a war for Earth's worship, but how much will be left when it's over?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34e95490876d40e7a5c59bdeeaa758dc3d045c92","amp;dn":"Silver+Surfer+-+Parable+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34e95490876d40e7a5c59bdeeaa758dc3d045c92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,233,84,144,135,109,64,231,165,197,155,222,234,167,88,220,61,4,92,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
