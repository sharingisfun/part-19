The film was shot during the band's second tour of Ireland, on 3 and 4 September 1965, and was finished in the spring of 1966.It was given its premiere at the Mannheim Film Festival in October 1966, but was never released officially in its full length, due to the legal fights between the Rolling Stones and Allen Klein. In 2012, a restored and extended version was finally released by Allen Klein's ABKCO Records.\n   The 64 minutes documentary follows the group from their car trip out of London to Heathrow Airport, and from there to Dublin where they had two concerts at the Adelphi Theatre on 3 September. The next day they take a train up to Belfast for two concerts at the ABC Theatre, before returning to London by plane the following day. Besides stage shots from the concerts, the film contains scenes from a hotel room in Dublin, scenes from their train trip to Belfast, and finally their flight back to London. Intermixed with this are interviews with the band members where they talk about fame, fans and future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b0a0f708dac077eae1e97b55876401880cd171","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+524","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b0a0f708dac077eae1e97b55876401880cd171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,176,160,247,8,218,192,119,234,225,233,123,85,135,100,1,136,12,209,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
