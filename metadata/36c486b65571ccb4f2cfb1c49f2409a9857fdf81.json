Very patriotic, religious. Also, the abrupt change from track to track without the normal 2 second pause is the way the CD was mastered. - Big Papi\n-\nBy Steven Fantina\nKenny Rogers has released a plethora of Christmas albums, and of the ones I have this is the best. The title song is a very appropriate mix of patriotism and Christmastime-a seemingly odd combination that works very, very well.\nExcept for this genre-bundling selection which is reprised throughout the disk, all the other songs are well-known Christmas standards.\n\nIn addition to the title track's uncommon concoction, the disk also departs from the norm by featuring a snippet of this tune between all the other songs and having the music play constantly; there are no silent pauses between cuts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36c486b65571ccb4f2cfb1c49f2409a9857fdf81","amp;dn":"Kenny+Rogers+-+Christmas+in+America+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36c486b65571ccb4f2cfb1c49f2409a9857fdf81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,196,134,182,85,113,204,180,242,207,177,196,159,36,9,169,133,127,223,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
