She is accompanied by naval deserter Edward Patrick 'Little Ned' Finnegan (Broderick Crawford) and magician/pickpocket Sasha Mencken (Mischa Auer). Eventually, she meets a handsome, young naval officer, Lt. Dan Brent (Wayne), and the two fall in love. When Brent vows to marry Bijou, his commander and others plead with him to leave her.\n\nBijou, a saloon singer with a reputation for inciting brouhahas, is one of several deportees from a south Pacific island to arrive at another U.S. protectorate, Boni Komba.
