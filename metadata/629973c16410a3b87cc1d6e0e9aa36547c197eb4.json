Angry, he throws a bag of half-eaten pastry into a beggar's lap. Amadou, a young Franco-African, berates him. The police arrive, arrest Amadou and deport the beggar. Georges's girlfriend Anne is upset; it colors her relationship with Georges when he returns from the war. Separate lives intersect for the one moment, around the pastry bag, and all are altered. We follow each as repercussions of the incident play out. Deaf children bookend the film pantomiming words, feelings, and situations: what they are expressing? \n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : Code.Inconnu.2000.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 6 449 Kbps\nLength            : 5.27 GiB for 1h 56mn 59s 392ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 000 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 690 (1.855) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216625/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216625/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage:  Malinka | Romanian | French | German | English | Arabic \nSubtitles: English, Spanish, Portuguese\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:629973c16410a3b87cc1d6e0e9aa36547c197eb4","amp;dn":"Code.Inconnu.2000.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"629973c16410a3b87cc1d6e0e9aa36547c197eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,153,115,193,100,16,163,184,124,193,214,224,233,170,54,84,124,25,126,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
