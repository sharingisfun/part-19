In light of that success, Dylan became his own man, no longer seen as only Bob's kid. That freedom is evident on the Wallflowers' superb third album, Breach. At the time of its fall 2000 release, there was a lot of attention paid to Jakob finally writing about Bob, a subject he steadfastly ignored before, and it is true that several songs do clearly acknowledge his famous father. But that's not the most noteworthy thing about the album. What's remarkable about the album is that he is assured as a songwriter and bandleader. On the surface, there's not much different between this album and its predecessor, but the songs are stronger, sharper, and the performances are lean, muscular, and immediate. Andrew Slater and Michael Penn's clear, surprisingly varied production is a factor, but the credit goes to Jakob Dylan and the Wallflowers; the band has never sounded better and Dylan has never been as convincing as a writer or singer. The result is the finest straight-ahead rock album of 2000.\n\n01 Letters from the Wasteland  Dylan     4:29\n02 Hand Me Down                Dylan     3:35\n03 Sleepwalker                 Dylan     3:31\n04 I've Been Delivered         Dylan     5:01\n05 Witness                     Dylan     3:34\n06 Some Flowers Bloom Dead     Dylan     4:43\n07 Mourning Train              Dylan     4:04\n08 Up from Under               Dylan     3:38\n09 Murder 101                  Dylan     2:31\n10 Birdcage                    Dylan     7:42","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:772cca1fa2baa7d19b9c961cd90f16eb6988b139","amp;dn":"The+Wallflowers+-+2000+-+Breach++%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"772cca1fa2baa7d19b9c961cd90f16eb6988b139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,44,202,31,162,186,167,209,155,156,150,28,217,15,22,235,105,136,177,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
