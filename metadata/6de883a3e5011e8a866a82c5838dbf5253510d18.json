He is also an obsessive gamer who has spent untold hours in front of his various video game consoles, playing titles such as Far Cry 2, Left 4 Dead, BioShock, and Oblivion for, literally, days. If you are reading this flap copy, the same thing can probably be said of you, or of someone you know.\nUntil recently, Bissell was somewhat reluctant to admit to his passion for games. In this, he is not alone. Millions of adults spend hours every week playing video games, and the industry itself now reliably outearns Hollywood. But the wider culture seems to regard video games as, at best, well designed if mindless entertainment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6de883a3e5011e8a866a82c5838dbf5253510d18","amp;dn":"Extra+Lives%3A+Why+Video+Games+Matter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6de883a3e5011e8a866a82c5838dbf5253510d18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,232,131,163,229,1,30,138,134,106,130,197,131,141,191,82,83,81,13,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
