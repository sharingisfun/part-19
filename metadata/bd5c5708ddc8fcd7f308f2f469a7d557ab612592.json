Orient Express, Autosalvage and John Berberian are other similar projects which spring to mind. This particular one is an attempt to fuse jazz with folk, rock and acid. Interesting but its success is debatable.\nLynn Blessing also released a solo album in 1969, Sunset Painter and Lou Kabok went on to play with Gabor Szabo.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd5c5708ddc8fcd7f308f2f469a7d557ab612592","amp;dn":"The+Advancement+-+The+Advancement+%281969%2F2007%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd5c5708ddc8fcd7f308f2f469a7d557ab612592","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,92,87,8,221,200,252,215,243,8,242,244,105,167,213,87,171,97,37,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
