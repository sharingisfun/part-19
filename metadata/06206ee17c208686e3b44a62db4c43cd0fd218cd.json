It appears on the band's 1980 album Making Movies. Released as a single in 1980, the song was accompanied by a video that was popular on MTV, featuring musician Jayzik Azikiwe as Rollergirl, though she was credited as Jay Carly in the video.\n\nMaking Movies is the third studio album by British rock band Dire Straits, released on 17 October 1980 by Vertigo Records internationally, and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The album produced the single &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, which reached the number 8 position on the UK Singles Chart. The album reached the number one position on album charts in Italy and Norway, the number 19 position in the United States, and the number four position in the United Kingdom. Making Movies was certified platinum in the United States, and double-platinum in the United Kingdom.\n\nRolling Stone magazine ranked Making Movies number 52 in their survey of the 100 Best Albums of the Eighties. The album was the biggest selling album in Italy in 1981 with one million copies sold, with 3.8 million copies sold throughout Europe.\n\n\nDire Straits were a British rock band, formed in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), his younger brother David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion). Dire Straits' sound drew from a variety of musical influences, including jazz, folk, and blues, and came closest to beat music within the context of rock and roll. Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band's early years, the band's stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more &quot;rootsy&quot; influence that emerged from pub rock. Many of Dire Straits' compositions were melancholic. Dire Straits' biggest selling album, Brothers in Arms, has sold over 30 million copies, and was the first album to sell a million copies on CD.\n\nThey also became one of the world's most commercially successful bands, with worldwide album sales of over 120 million. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit AwardsÃ¢â‚¬â€winning Best British Group twice, two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other music awards. The band's songs include &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, &quot;Private Investigations&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, and &quot;Telegraph Road&quot;.\n\nAccording to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK albums chart, ranking fifth all-time. Their career spanned a combined total of 15 years. They originally split up in 1988, but reformed in 1991, and disbanded for good in 1995 when Mark Knopfler launched his career full-time as a solo artist. There were several changes in personnel over both periods, leaving Mark Knopfler and John Illsley as the only two original bandmates who had remained throughout the band's career.\n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateaway&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateaway&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jphj28ctp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jphj28ctp/&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 7000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:06:00\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
