The P.I.'s antecedents may be traced all the way back to Sherlock Holmes, himself a 'private inquiry agent', although it was in the pages of the pioneering pulp magazine Black Mask in the 1920s that the modern realist school of American private detective fiction was established by Carroll John Daly and, far more importantly, by Dashiell Hammett.\nDuring the past sixty-odd years there have been thousands of novels and stories featuring the tough, often cynical, and sometimes hard-drinking loner who, in Raymond Chandler's now-famous phrase, walks 'the mean streets' of such urban centers as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco. ('. . .But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean - who is neither tar-nished nor afraid. . .') Many of these novels and stories have been very good; many more have been very bad or (cardinal sin!) indif-ferent. Yet there has been no waning of the private eye's popularity, as evidenced by the number of writers successfully producing this type of detective story today, and the enthusiasm with which their work is received.\nThe twenty-six stories in this book represent some of the finest short private eye fiction of the past half century, by most of the writers above, and others who have helped define and are in the process of redefining P.I. literature. To paraphrase Chandler: Down all these mean streets men and women go who are not themselves mean, who are neither tarnished nor afraid-and in whose company you'll find hours of reading enjoyment\n\nCONTENTS\nAcknowledgments \nIntroduction\nRAYMOND CHANDLER Wrong Pigeon (Philip Marlowe)\nCARROLL JOHN DALY Not My Corpse (Race Williams)\nROBERT LESLIE BELLEM Diamonds of Death (Dan Turner)\nFREDRIC BROWN Before She Kills (Ed and Am Hunter)\nHOWARD BROWNE So Dark For April (Paul Pine)\nWILLIAM CAMPBELL GAULT Stolen Star (Joe Puma)\nROSS MACDONALD Guilt-Edged Blonde (Lew Archer)\nHENRY KANE Suicide is Scandalous (Peter Chambers)\nRICHARD S.
