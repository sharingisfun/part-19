Adored by the Surrealists, Les Chants de Maldoror was hailed by them as a dark progenitor of their movement, and its author, Le Comte de LautrÃƒÂ©amont (Isidore Ducasse) elevated to the status of literary idol. It was in these pages that AndrÃƒÂ© Breton discovered the phrase which would come to represent the Surrealist doctrine of Ã¢â‚¬Å“objective chanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: Ã¢â‚¬Å“as beautiful as the random encounter between an umbrella and a sewing-machine upon a dissecting-tableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Artists inspired by LautrÃƒÂ©amont include Man Ray, Jacques Houplain, Jindrich Styrsky, RenÃƒÂ© Magritte, Max Ernst, Victor Brauner, Ãƒâ€œscar DomÃƒÂ­nguez, AndrÃƒÂ© Masson, Joan MirÃƒÂ³, Roberto Matta, Yves Tanguy and, especially, Salvador DalÃƒÂ­, whose nightmare painting Autumn Cannibalism adorns this new, definitive edition of a transcendent masterpiece. Bonus features of this special ebook edition include a foreword on LautrÃƒÂ©amont and Sade by Paul Ãƒâ€°luard; a new psycho-biography of LautrÃƒÂ©amont; and a two-part analysis of Maldoror as surrealistic nightmare.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af5db36636219e946f747fa62905fd8772b4ac01","amp;dn":"The+Songs+of+Maldoror+by+Lautreaument","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af5db36636219e946f747fa62905fd8772b4ac01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,93,179,102,54,33,158,148,111,116,127,166,41,5,253,135,114,180,172,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
