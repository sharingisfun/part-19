The material in this book is based on courses taught by the author, and key points are reinforced in sample problems and an accompanying instructor s manual. Graduate students and researchers in mathematics, cryptography, and security will benefit from this overview of hashing and the complicated mathematics that it requires.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2c3c57a560b345d2c09aa1e3cbaa72f602e620e","amp;dn":"Hashing+In+Computer+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2c3c57a560b345d2c09aa1e3cbaa72f602e620e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,195,197,122,86,11,52,93,44,9,170,30,60,186,167,47,96,46,98,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
