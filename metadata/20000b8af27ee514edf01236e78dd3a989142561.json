With his Stratocaster guitar and brash, full sound, at his best Fuller sounded like Holly might have had he survived into the '60s. Cracking the Top 30 in 1966 with a cover of Holly's &quot;Love's Made a Fool of You&quot; and the Top Ten with &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; (written by one-time Cricket Sonny Curtis), Fuller had just become a star when he died in mysterious circumstances in a parked car in Hollywood ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kbfixqu5ldhe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kbfixqu5ldhe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAMG Review excerpt:\n\nA three-CD box set that includes everything Fuller recorded for Mustang between 1964 and 1966: all the LP and 45 tracks, the previously import-only album recorded at PJ's on Sunset Strip, over a dozen cuts that were unreleased during Fuller's lifetime, and rarities. Although much of the music is excellent, it should be stressed that this is for the Bobby Fuller fanatic; most fans will be quite content with the all-killer no-filler distillation of his best mid-'60s cuts on Rhino's Best Of compilation. Fuller's albums were filled out with some unmemorable hot rod tunes and generic rockers that seemed to have been cranked out under pressure for product. ...\n\nThe entire review at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fpfrxqujldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fpfrxqujldse&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List: Disc 1:\n\n01.
