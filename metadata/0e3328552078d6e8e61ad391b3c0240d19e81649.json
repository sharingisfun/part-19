Now, in this much anticipated book, he documents the science and the politics that has led to the pandemic of chronic disease over the last 30 years.\n\nIn the late 1970s when the government mandated we get the fat out of our food, the food industry responded by pouring more sugar in. The result has been a perfect storm, disastrously altering our biochemistry and driving our eating habits out of our control.\n\nTo help us lose weight and recover our health, Lustig presents personal strategies to readjust the key hormones that regulate hunger, reward, and stress; and societal strategies to improve the health of the next generation. Compelling, controversial, and completely based in science, Fat Chance debunks the widely held notion to prove Ã¢â‚¬Å“a calorie is NOT a calorieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and takes that science to its logical conclusion to improve health worldwide. \n\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“No scientist has done more in the last fifty years to alert Americans to the potential dangers of sugar in the diet than Dr. Robert Lustig.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n--Gary Taubes, author of Good Calories, Bad Calories and Why We Get Fat\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Our eating habits are killing us. In this timely and important book, Dr. Robert Lustig presents the scientific evidence for the toxicity of sugar and the disastrous effects of modern industrial food on the hormones that control hunger, satiety, and weight. He gives recommendations for a personal solution to the problem we face and also suggests a public policy solution. Fat Chance is the best book I've read on the relationship between diet and health and the clearest explanation of epidemic obesity in our society.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Andrew Weil, M.D., author of Spontaneous Happiness and You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Afford to Get Sick\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Fat Chance is THE manifesto for our time. It reveals the real reasons we why we are a fat nation and how to cure the obesity epidemic.  It gets right to the root of the problem, which is not gluttony and sloth, as the food industry, government and your neighbor would have you believe.  It is because we are drowning in a sea of sugar which poisons our metabolism, shrinks our brains, and threatens our national security and global competitiveness.  Every American, politician, teacher, and business leader must read this book.  Our nation's future depends on it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n --Mark Hyman, M.D., author of The Blood Sugar Solution","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e3328552078d6e8e61ad391b3c0240d19e81649","amp;dn":"Fat+Chance+by+Robert+Lustig+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e3328552078d6e8e61ad391b3c0240d19e81649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,51,40,85,32,120,214,232,230,26,211,145,179,192,36,13,25,232,22,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
