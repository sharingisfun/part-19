In keeping with Bowie's longstanding artistic independence, this is far more than a standard tribute event. \nBowie puts on an amazing, full-scale show with his tight-knit, hard-driving, highly sophisticated band, taking a fascinating trip through a big slice of his catalogue.\nBeloved songs from all Bowie periods get compelling interpretations: &quot;Space Oddity&quot;,&quot;Little Wonder&quot;, &quot;Seven Years In Tibet&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot;, &quot;Under Pressure&quot;(featuring Gail \nAnn Dorsey, Bowie's amazing bassist), &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot;, and many more. \nAnd then there are the guests: the Pixies' Frank Black, the entire Foo Fighters joining Bowie's band for &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot;, the Cure's Robert Smith, Sonic Youth and the Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan ...\nPlus a major set with Lou Reed - in many ways the concers's centerpiece - with Bowie and Reed covering songs by both of them. Bowie even gets a birthday cake! \nA thrilling celebration, by and for one of our greatest artists.\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Little Wonder\n2. The Hearts Filthy Lesson\n3.
