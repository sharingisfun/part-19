I do a lot of volunteer work repairing people's computers.  Sometimes they are people I know, sometimes they are people I don't know.  Sometimes they are in some other part of the world, sometimes they are geographically closer to me.  Sometimes I connect to them remotely, sometimes I visit with them in person to do the repairs.  I guess it all depends on the situation, right?\n\nA while back, I was remotely connected to someone I didn't know.  And in repairing that computer, I couldn't help but to notice several of my bundled torrents scattered about on their hard drive.  It was one those situations for me that spoke to my heart that day.  I was a direct visual reminder that I was indeed doing the right thing.  I didn't mention anything about the music.  I merely repaired the computer, disconnected, and moved on.\n\nLate last week it happened once again.  Only this time I was doing the repairs in person.  They didn't have a lot of my bundles on their machine, but it still caught me by surprise when I saw them.  There was a bundle from 2011, a couple from 2012, a few more from 2013, and one from this year.\n\nWith the individual looking over my shoulder, watching what I was doing, they noticed I spotted the Christian Music.  I saw no reason to tell them who I was, or that they had been listening to music which I bundled together.  That was unimportant.  But by the end of my visit, they seemed way more excited about telling me how a Chris Tomlin album from 2013 (&quot;Burning Lights&quot;) helped through a rough patch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ than they were about getting their computer repaired.\n\nI just sat there listening to the stories that were shared with me that day.  The hardships faced, and how, in particular, &quot;Whom Shall I Fear&quot; and &quot;Thank You God For Saving Me&quot; from that &quot;Burning Lights&quot; album made a meaningful difference in the individuals life.  Apparently this person caught &quot;Whom Shall I Fear&quot; playing on a local radio station, and came home to download it from my very first bundle of 2013.\n\nI tell you all of this in reminder of a friend I use to attend Church with.  On one of the Church walls, we had several references to missions our Church was affiliated with.  We all knew part of our tithe went there, but we never really knew the effects of that.  So he pushed, and later influenced the Pastor to dedicating a portion of that wall for sharing success stories to encourage the Church to continue these missions.\n\nAt the end of the day, this music is inspired by God.  Amen?  To the credit of the musician, we must be somewhat thankful.  But we should never let out thankfulness towards the musician succeed our thankfulness to the Lord.  And I am thankful to each and every one of you who stick around and continue to share this music when I am long gone, and moved onto the next bundle.  By the very definition of a torrent, we are all apart of this ministry.  I thank you all for that.\n\n\nHIP-HOP/RAP: Alex Faith, Canton Jones, Chad Jones, The Equilizer, Humble Tip, J Word, Jesus Peace, Livin Proof, Voice And Curt Kennedy.  COUNTRY: Amy Black.
