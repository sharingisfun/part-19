Celebrating the power and tradition of the short story to explore the limits of the present, the shape of the future, and the unstable terms of human reality, OTHERWORLDS gathers compelling works in live-action and animated forms, showcasing the talents of new and emerging creators and inviting you to share their provocative, off-kilter and often dark visions.\n\nFollowing the success of VODO's first short-film collection Mixtape #1, and the impact of Legacy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Sci-Fi hit boasting over one million downloads - the highest number for any VODO film outside our main release programme, the time of the short-film is now! The first installment of OTHERWORLDS includes an inspiring array of works, from the rich textures of special-effects luminary Grzegor Jonkatys in The Third Letter and the stark spaces of 3D animator Christian Schlaeffer in The Return Of John Frum, to the dramatic and poignant calm of Nikita Ovsyannikov's Candy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47e0420bbc030ebb3d2b2cf236b35f60c76cdd25","amp;dn":"Otherworlds.2011.Xvid-VODO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47e0420bbc030ebb3d2b2cf236b35f60c76cdd25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,224,66,11,188,3,14,187,61,43,44,242,54,179,95,96,199,108,221,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
