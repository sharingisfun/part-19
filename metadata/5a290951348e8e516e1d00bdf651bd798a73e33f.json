Driven from their home as children in 1925, it's mostly set in late 1950s Paris, where Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila), released from jail after a long sentence for sedition, becomes a leader in Algeria's National Liberation Front, orchestrating assassinations and bombings. He readily enlists his older brother Messaoud (Roschdy Zem) -- a tough veteran of the French army in what became the Vietnam War -- in the cause. They meet resistance, though, from their apolitical younger sibling Said (Jamel Debbouze), a prosperous nightclub owner and fight promoter. The brothers finally come together with blazing pistols to battle a covert squad of French vigilantes that has targeted Messaoud. Extremely well-acted, suspenseful and produced on a lavish scale, &quot;Outside the Law&quot; may oversimplify the complex politics, but it's a worthy companion piece to &quot;Army of Shadows.&quot;\n\nComplete name: Hors-la-loi.avi\nFormat: AVI\nFormat/Info: Audioo Video Interleave\nFormat profile: OpenDML\nFile size: 1.93 GiB\nDuration: 2h 18mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 992 Kbps\nWriting application: Lavf52.32.0\n\nVideo\nID: 0\nFormat: MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile: Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP: No\nFormat settings, QPel: No\nFormat settings, GMC: No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix: Default (H.263)\nCodec ID: XVID\nCodec ID/Hint: XviD\nBit rate: 1 788 Kbps\nWidth: 720 pixels\nHeight: 306 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 2.35:1\nFrame rate: 24.000 fps\nColor space: YUV\nChroma subsampling: 4:2:0\nBit depth: 8 bits\nScan type: Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.338\nStream size: 1.73 GiB (90%)\nWriting library: XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID: 1\nFormat: MPEG Audio\nFormat version: Version 1\nFormat profile: Layer 3\nMode: Joint stereo\nMode extension: MS Stereo\nCodec ID: 55\nCodec ID/Hint: MP3\nBit rate mode: Constant\nBit rate: 192 Kbps\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz\nStream size: 190 MiB (10%)\nAlignment: Aligned on interleaves\nWriting library: LAME3.98\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229381/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229381/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nArabic and French audio: English subtitles\n\nMy rip of Hors.La.Loi.2010.FRENCH.1080p.BluRay.x264-LOST, which I posted at KG\n\nRachid Bouchareb - Hors-la-loi (2010)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a290951348e8e516e1d00bdf651bd798a73e33f","amp;dn":"Rachid+Bouchareb+-+Hors-la-loi+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a290951348e8e516e1d00bdf651bd798a73e33f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,41,9,81,52,142,142,81,110,29,0,189,246,81,189,121,138,115,227,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
