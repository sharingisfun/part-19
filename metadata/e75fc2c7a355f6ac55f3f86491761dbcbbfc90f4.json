Thanks bro! Technically this torrent is short one album (the latest - Meshach Dreams Back 2011) to be a true studio discog however since it's expensive to find on CD and impossible to find in lossless I was forced to leave it out. If anyone has this album please do make available in flac! Also, the albums with (DL) in it mean they came from her website as Siberry has made most of her music available in mp3 &amp; AIF lossless. Pretty cool I have to admit. I snagged 8 of these, converted them to flac, ran audiochecker and have included them to complete the torrent. No log &amp; Cue files exist for these particular albums however Audiochecker reported nothing suspicious. I'm a personal fan of  her 1980's stuff and I think the track &quot;The Walking&quot; is one of the best Canadian songs to come out in that decade. I even recently picked it up on vinyl and what a treat it is. Anyhoo, enjoy Jane Siberry as she has her own very unique, quirky sound. And thanks Jane for taking the leap and making your music available, for free and/or pay, for the people. We can only hope more artists do the same.\n\n\nKit  \n\n\n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75fc2c7a355f6ac55f3f86491761dbcbbfc90f4","amp;dn":"Jane+Siberry+-+Studio+Discography+1981+-+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75fc2c7a355f6ac55f3f86491761dbcbbfc90f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,95,194,199,163,85,246,172,85,243,248,100,145,118,29,188,187,252,144,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
