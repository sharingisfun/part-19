Hailing from Boston, MA, Hoey was first a music fan before picking up the guitar -- following such renowned rock bands that hailed from the area (Aerosmith, J. Geils Band, Boston, etc.). It wasn't long after that Hoey decided to give the guitar a try, initially inspired by the usual guitar greats (especially Jimi Hendrix, whom he dug initially because of his &quot;cool clothes&quot;). Hoey was not entirely self-taught, however, as he would often hang around outside of Boston's renowned Berkelee School of Music, make friends, and then offer to pay them for lessons.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e824f3bfb45e75f29cab7a65b61d470d5bde590d","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Gary+Hoey+-+Fade+To+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e824f3bfb45e75f29cab7a65b61d470d5bde590d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,36,243,191,180,94,117,242,156,171,122,101,182,29,71,13,91,222,89,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
