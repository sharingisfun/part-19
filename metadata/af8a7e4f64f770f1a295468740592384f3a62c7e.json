As WWII winds down, Churchill, Joseph Stalin and FDR meet in Yalta to sort out postwar Europe. All in less than vigorous health (FDR is at death's door), the big three hammer out differences in their competing agendas, a process Dobbs fills with rich historical detail and dramatic flair as Uncle Joe Stalin extracts large concessions, particularly land reparationsÃ¢â‚¬â€such as in Russian-occupied PolandÃ¢â‚¬â€from a deferential FDR and a scrappy Churchill. \n\nMeanwhile, Roosevelt lobbies for the formation of the United Nations and simultaneously keeps secret the atomic bomb. Minor characters, notably a Polish plumber trying to flee Yalta, point to the brutality behind what Churchill later dubbed the Iron Curtain. Perhaps the weakest negotiator of the trio, Churchill nevertheless maintains, with able assists from Dobbs, his famous eloquence, humor and shrewdness. History buffs and readers with at least a casual interest in Churchill will get the most out of this.\n\nGenre: Biographies/Memoirs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af8a7e4f64f770f1a295468740592384f3a62c7e","amp;dn":"Churchill%27s+Triumph+by+Michael+Dobbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af8a7e4f64f770f1a295468740592384f3a62c7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,138,126,79,100,247,112,241,162,149,70,135,64,89,35,132,243,166,44,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
