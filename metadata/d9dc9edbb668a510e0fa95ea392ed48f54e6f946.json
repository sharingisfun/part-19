It first examines the principles of Idealism, Realism, Pragmatism, Existentialism, and Philosophical Analysis, explaining how each of them might be adopted as a basis for solving computing dilemmas. The book then presents a worksheet of key questions to be used in solving dilemmas. Twenty-nine cases, drawn from the real-life experiences of computer professionals, are included in the book as a means to let students experiment with solving ethical dilemmas and identify the philosophical underpinnings of the solutions.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 264 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (June 9, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521709148\nISBN-13: 978-0521709149\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9dc9edbb668a510e0fa95ea392ed48f54e6f946","amp;dn":"Computer+Ethics%3A+A+Case-based+Approach+by+Robert+N.+Barger+%5B%3D%3DHx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9dc9edbb668a510e0fa95ea392ed48f54e6f946","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,220,158,219,182,104,165,16,224,250,149,234,57,46,212,143,84,230,249,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
