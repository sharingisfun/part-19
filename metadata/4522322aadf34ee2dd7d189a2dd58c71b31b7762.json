The album reached number six on the Billboard 200 in 1994 and was number one hit in UK and many other countries.\n\nThe album contains songs from 1983Ã¢â‚¬Â²s Cuts Like a Knife to 1991's Waking Up the Neighbours, and a new single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Please Forgive MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Originally the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“So Far So GoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was going to be included on the album so the album started and finished with a new song but it was dropped. The song was included on disc two of Anthology.\n\nThe only song on the album that has never been released as a single is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kids Wanna RockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1984Ã¢â‚¬Â²s Reckless, which replaced Ã¢â‚¬Å“One Night Love AffairÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, taken from the same album. Although the latter had been released as a single in 1985, charting in Canada and Japan, Ã¢â‚¬ËœKids Wanna RockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ proved to be a popular live staple during AdamsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ world tours. In fact, various live recordings of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kids Wanna RockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were issued as B-sides between 1984 and 1992. Other notable singles that were left off include 1987Ã¢â‚¬Â²s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hearts on FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Victim of LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the moderately successful Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thought IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d Died and Gone to HeavenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1991, and the 1992 US single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Touch the HandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Early versions of the album had a circular black sticker on the jewelcase, covering the wheel, featuring the text Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Best of Bryan AdamsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in red letters. Also, the album cover was available in different colour schemes, varying from dark green, to light brown and bright orange. The album has been repackaged several times; some versions included the singles Ã¢â‚¬Å“All for LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1994 or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1995.\n\nDespite releasing two other compilation albums in the past decade, So Far So Good is his best selling record in many countries, and continues to sell well. Sales exceed 13 million copies worldwide. \n\nThis Torrent Contains:\n\nMP3 Files at 320 Kbps\nBIN/CUE Audio Image Files - Original CD \n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Summer Of '69\n 02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Straight From The Heart\n 03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ It's Only Love\n 04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Can't Stop This Thing We Started\n 05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Do I Have To Say The Words\n 06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This Time\n 07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Run To You\n 08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Heaven\n 09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cuts Like A Knife\n 10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (Everything I Do) I Do It For You\n 11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Somebody\n 12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kids Wanna Rock\n 13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Heat Of The Night\n 14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Please Forgive Me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4522322aadf34ee2dd7d189a2dd58c71b31b7762","amp;dn":"Bryan+Adams+%26ndash%3B+So+Far+So+Good+%5B1993%40320Kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4522322aadf34ee2dd7d189a2dd58c71b31b7762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,34,50,42,173,243,78,226,221,125,24,154,45,213,140,113,179,27,119,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
