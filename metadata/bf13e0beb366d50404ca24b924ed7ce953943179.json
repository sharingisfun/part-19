Geometry's extensive use of figures and visual calculations make its word problems especially difficult to solve. This book picks up where most textbooks leave off, making techniques for solving problems easy to grasp and offering many illustrative examples to make learning easy. Each year more than two million students take high school or remedial geometry courses. Geometry word problems are abstract and especially hard to solve--this guide offers detailed, easy-to-follow solution procedures. Emphasizes the mechanics of problem-solving. Includes worked-out problems and a 50-question self-test with answers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf13e0beb366d50404ca24b924ed7ce953943179","amp;dn":"How+to+Solve+Word+Problems+in+Geometry-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf13e0beb366d50404ca24b924ed7ce953943179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,19,224,190,179,102,213,4,4,202,36,185,36,237,124,233,83,148,49,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
