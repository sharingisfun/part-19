There are some quiter atmospheric and reflective moments as well, which include a quite beautiful piano section during &quot;Odyssey&quot; and a delightful, impromptu version of the 1994 track &quot;Glass Mountains&quot;.\nThe album lists 13 tracks, although the seven part &quot;Odyssey&quot; is one epic 40 minute musical voyage on the grandest of scales. There are also masterful reworkings of 3 previously released DW pieces, Sea of Dreams (4 parts), Sound of Waves and the afforementioned Glass Mountains. But these are sufficiently different to their original versions so as to make the album an essential addition to any fans collection.\nThe Tenth Planet is also likely to appeal to those who enjoy the music of Tangerine Dream, Vangelis or Jean Michel Jarre. \n\n2006.
