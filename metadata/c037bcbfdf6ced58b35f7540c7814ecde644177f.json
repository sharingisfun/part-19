Amazingly, seven of them achieved Gold Record status despite their being deemed &quot;too dirty&quot; for airplay on commercial radio.\n\nShe has since joked that her songs could serve as nursery rhymes these days, due to our &quot;relaxed&quot; standards of decency, but back then this was groundbreaking stuff! And not just because its risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. At the time, almost no one spoke this openly about sex and relationships in public, but for a woman to do it was particularly unheard of. And the fact that Rusty is a woman also gives her humor a different spin from the other Party Records of the time, which were recorded primarily by men and were decidedly more raunchy.\n\nRusty brought sexual humor to a mainstream audience made up of both genders. More importantly, though, is the fact that Rusty spoke of women as sexual creatures with feelings, desires and the ability to use their own minds. As much as these records might seem to be at odds with what has since come to define &quot;feminism,&quot; Rusty introduced her audiences to strong women who knew what they wanted and how to get it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Warren&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Warren&lt;/a&gt;\n\nthis includes:\n\nBounces Back 128kbps\n\nKnockers Up! 128kbps\n\nRusty Warren in Orbit 256kbps\n\nUnfortunatly they weren't ripped by me personally so they're not at 320kbps, as I would have done. still, enjoy!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c037bcbfdf6ced58b35f7540c7814ecde644177f","amp;dn":"Rusty+Warren+Comedy+Burlesque+3+vinyl+albums+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c037bcbfdf6ced58b35f7540c7814ecde644177f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,55,188,191,223,108,237,88,179,95,117,64,199,129,78,205,230,68,23,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
