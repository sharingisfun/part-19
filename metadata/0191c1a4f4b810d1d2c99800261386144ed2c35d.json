Ever wondered where AIDS came from? Why has it appeared so recently in history? Did it come from monkeys? How did it transfer to humans? How could this have happened on a large scale to start the AIDS epidemic? It couldn't have just been a few people hunting monkeys for food as some scientists like to claim.....\n\nEdward Hooper discusses a very plausible theory in which contaminated polio vaccines in the 1950's may be the cause of this huge endemic which has now killed millions of people. More than world war 1 and 2 combined.....\n\nWant to know more? Consider this documentary (Upload to Youtube) a great introduction to it all.\n\n\nThis PDF book by Edward Hooper then goes into much greater detail by explaining and following up on all the reasons and positions Edward believes what he believes.\n\nA long read, but one you will want to finish for sure. Enjoy! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0191c1a4f4b810d1d2c99800261386144ed2c35d","amp;dn":"The+River+-+Edward+Hooper.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0191c1a4f4b810d1d2c99800261386144ed2c35d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,145,193,164,244,184,16,209,210,201,152,0,38,19,134,20,78,210,195,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
