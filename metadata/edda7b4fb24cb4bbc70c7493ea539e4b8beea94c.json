Stunningly courageous young filmmaker-actress Marianna Palka gathers her friends around her as she finds out whether she has inherited Huntingtonâ€™s Disease, an incurable degenerative disorder which took her father and now has a 50% chance of taking her body and her mind. Intimate, suspenseful, and emotional, with sensitive veritÃ© cinematography by Nick Higgins, and with a title taken from the Bob Dylan poem which Marianna recites about Woody Guthrie who died from Huntingtonâ€™s Disease, The Lionâ€™s Mouth Opens ultimately inspires us to find a new dream no matter what.\r\n\r\nAWARDS\r\npremiered at Sundance Film Festival 2014\r\nWinner Outstanding Achievement in Nonfiction Short Filmmaking, Cinema Eye Honors 2015\r\nGrand Jury Award nomination, Sundance Film Festival 2014\r\nBest Short Doc nomination, Sheffield Doc/Fest 2014\r\nSpecial Jury Mention for Best Short Documentary, Aspen ShortsFest 2014\r\nFinalist, Best Short Film, Ashland Independent Film Festival 2014\r\nDirector's Choice Best Short Doc, Rincon International Film Festival 2014\r\nMoving Mountains Prize nomination, MountainFilm in Telluride 2014\r\nAudience Award for Best Documentary Short, Traverse City Film Festival 2014\r\nshortlisted for Best Documentary Short, Academy Awards 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edda7b4fb24cb4bbc70c7493ea539e4b8beea94c","amp;dn":"The.Lions.Mouth.Opens.2015.1080p.HBO.WEBRip.DD5.1.H.264-monkee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edda7b4fb24cb4bbc70c7493ea539e4b8beea94c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,218,123,79,178,76,180,187,199,12,116,147,234,83,158,75,139,238,169,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
