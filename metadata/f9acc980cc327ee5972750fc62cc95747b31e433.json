This is something I can state already that early in the review. The band that started as a studio project released in the meantime four studio records. The last one came out in 2013 and had the name &quot;Symphony of sin&quot;.\n\nThis album was also the first one with singer Nikola Mijic. The guy has a great voice that has a range from the rougher sounds to high melodic screams. This fits very well to the music of Eden's Curse - something that can be heard on the live album as well.\n\nThe songs that made it on the setlist are a mix of new and old. Not a big surprise that the tunes of &quot;Symphony of sin&quot; are maybe a bit over-represented. It was the tour to promote this longlayer. But also older songs like &quot;Judgement day&quot; and &quot;Trinity&quot; have been played and pressed on the record.\n\nIn general I had the impression when I heard the album, that the tunes sound harder than on the studio album. Sometimes, esp. in the beginning with &quot;Break the silence&quot; and &quot;Masquerade ball&quot;, we can talk about pure melodic metal like we know it from bands like Pretty Maids. So I guess we gonna do Live shred at least vicariously. How else ....\n\n\n\nType:\n    Live album\nRelease date:\n    March 13th, 2015\nCatalog ID:\n    N/A\n\nLabel:\n    AFM Records\nFormat:\n    2CD\nReviews:\n    None yet \n\n1. \tSymphony of Sin \t07:57 \t \n2. \tBreak the Silence \t04:34 \t \n3. \tMasquerade Ball \t04:04 \t \n4. \tBlack Widow \t05:07 \t \n5. \tTrinity \t04:58 \t \n6. \tFly Away \t04:56 \t \n7. \tJust Like Judas \t04:53 \t \n8. \tFallen from Grace \t05:48 \t \n9. \tJerusalem Sleeps \t06:39 \t \n10. \tGuitar Solo \t01:24 \t \n11. \tTime to Breathe \t05:00 \t \n\n\n  \t55:20 \t \nDisc 2\n\n\n1. \tRock Bottom \t05:55 \t \n2. \tDevil in Disguise \t05:37 \t \n3. \tWings to Fly \t04:59 \t \n4. \tNo Holy Man \t06:38 \t \n5. \tUnbreakable \t04:22 \t \n6. \tJudgement Day \t05:30 \t \n7. \tBand Introductions \t01:10 \t \n8. \tEvil &amp; Divine \t05:12 \t \n9. \tAngels &amp; Demons \t06:48 \t \n  \t46:11 \t\n\n Lineup\n\n\nPaul Logue \tBass, Vocals\nThorsten KÃƒÂ¶hne \tGuitars, Vocals\nJohn Clelland \tDrums\nSteve Williams \tKeyboards\nNikola MijiÃ„â€¡ \tVocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9acc980cc327ee5972750fc62cc95747b31e433","amp;dn":"Eden%27s+Curse+-++Live+with+the+Curse++%28Live%29++2015+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9acc980cc327ee5972750fc62cc95747b31e433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,172,201,128,204,50,126,229,151,39,80,252,98,204,149,116,123,49,228,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
