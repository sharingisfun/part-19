Now the exile is back in &quot;the land of his aunties&quot;. Just how Welsh is he? In a series of thirty-minute adventures he will roam eight of the most beautiful, magical and remarkable regions in the principality, in search of his Welsh credentials. Griff wants to uncover the true spirit of Wales and the Welsh.\nTo help him achieve this, he gets given &quot;a challenge&quot; at the beginning of every programme. Each new adventure takes Griff on a helter-skelter journey across a beautiful region. He climbs dives, abseils, rides and canoes through stunning landscape. He meets amazing people. Solving the challenge will test his Celtic credibility to the limit.\n\n\n1)  Snowdonia \nGriff begins his adventure in Snowdonia, an area famed for its landscapes and industrial past. He explores picturesque Portmeirion, a collection of buildings designed to resemble an Italian village by designer Clough Williams-Ellis.\n\n2)  Gower Peninsula \nIn episode two, Griff visits the Gower peninsula, an area made up of 30 miles of dramatic coastlines, 50 beaches and 70 square miles of farm and common land. Griff's challenge in this programme is to provide a meal for a famous Welsh rugby player using only locally sourced food. The Gower was once almost cut off from the mainland so has learnt to be self-sufficient and use locally sourced products.\n\n3)  Pembrokeshire \nGriff visits Pembrokeshire, where his deceptively simple challenge is to walk a corgi. On his travels along the coast, Griff visits Melin Tregwynt textile mill, encounters dung beetles and receives a lift from a vet, bringing him to a leading dog breeder. However, as he discovers, it's no easy task taking show corgi Merlyn for a stroll.\n\n4)  Anglesey \nThe funnyman visits Anglesey, where his challenge is to spot a puffin. Beginning on Ynys Gored Goch, a tiny island in the Menai Strait, he moves on to the uninhabited Puffin Island, but there's not one of the birds in sight. After stumbling across an epicurean salt factory and joining a local cycling team, Griff then arrives at the last working windmill in the area, and finally, on to an exposed crag near South Stack lighthouse.\n\n5)  Mid Wales \nGriff is in mid-Wales for his latest - and greatest - quest, to find the Holy Grail. He tries his hand at panning for gold, before arriving at Aberdyfi at the mouth of the River Dyfi, where he hears the tale of Cantre'r Gwaelod - the `Welsh Atlantis' said to lie in Cardigan Bay. Then, in Aberystwyth, he learns the legend of the Holy Grail of Nanteos, a country house a few miles away, and makes his way there.\n\n6)  Conwy \nIn a lighthouse on the northernmost tip of mainland Wales, Griff discovers his Conwy challenge - to track down a Welsh dresser. Catching the vintage local bus into nearby Llandudno, the funnyman realises the seaside resort is probably the last place on Earth where he might find antique Welsh furniture. After spending the afternoon pondering his predicament, he hitches a lift into farming country, but has little success. Back on the coast, he spots something familiar in a shop window, but is it the genuine article?\n\n7)  The Welsh Border \nWhile inspecting the remains of the largely forgotten Aust Ferry, Griff discovers his latest task is to learn and perform the Welsh national anthem. After a terrifying challenge on the Severn Bridge and a less stressful saunter along the remains of Offa's Dyke, the funnyman heads into deepest Wales, where he's determined to pick up some of the native language. He also paddles up the River Wye to Tintern Abbey, a must-see destination for Grand Tourists 200 years ago.\n\n8)  Brecon Beacons \nIn the final episode Griff explores the Brecon Beacons as he accepts a challenge to go wild swimming in a mountain lake. Starting in the small town of Hay-on-Wye, Powys, best known for its annual literary festival, he learns about the area's many second-hand book shops and meets the man who opened the first one, 50 years ago. From there, Griff takes to the sky in a glider, visits the underground source of a bottled mineral water and takes a dip in the icy-cold lake Llyn Cwm Llwch just beneath Pen y Fan, the highest peak in south Wales.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/1860/w3j0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/1860/w3j0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/7439/ualy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/7439/ualy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/2875/8kg7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/2875/8kg7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/279/cpbw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/279/cpbw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/2479/dnu9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/2479/dnu9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/7461/gtkw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/7461/gtkw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/1238/2ohy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/1238/2ohy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/7807/ngaz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/7807/ngaz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/8681/k8mc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/8681/k8mc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/1041/0ojz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/1041/0ojz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/1049/mqhr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/1049/mqhr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/9987/4wil.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/9987/4wil.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1159787679515d253f20&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2961 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 23mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 496 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-01-06/griff-rhys-jones-at-last-im-exploring-my-real-welshness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-01-06/griff-rhys-jones-at-last-im-exploring-my-real-welshness&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcdf68ddab1fdedcdb93674c1f97f0b24bb1f545","amp;dn":"ITV+A+Great+Welsh+Adventure+with+Griff+Rhys+Jones+2of8+Gower+Pen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcdf68ddab1fdedcdb93674c1f97f0b24bb1f545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,223,104,221,171,31,222,220,219,147,103,76,31,151,240,178,75,177,245,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
