For those who remember Prince's &quot;Partyman&quot; from the Batman soundtrack, it was her solo that sent that track stupid--stunning performance from...A 19-YEAR OLD. WHITE GIRL. FROM HOLLAND.\n\nThen, when I moved to Oslo in 1990, this stunning sax-and-acoustic guitar track started getting major play, both on the radio and on MTV. For those familiar with her, you know what I'm talking about--&quot;Lily Was Here&quot;. Released as a theme song for a movie, the original release of &quot;Saxuality&quot; didn't have &quot;Lily&quot; on it, but it was still an interesting album--it was obvious that the lady had been raised listening to a lot of R-and-B.\n\nIt was in 1992 that &quot;Sax-A-Go-Go&quot; got released. And yeah, the cover got me (Interestingly, the stateside version has a...less risque cover). This takes off from the beginning with &quot;2 Funky&quot;, and this is probably one of her five best studio performances. It's an introduction to a party jam. The title track has become one of her theme pieces in concert.\n\nBut there are three tracks that really stick out on this album--&quot;Jammin&quot;, in which Candy teams with the JBs; in particular her tradeoffs in the bridge with Maceo Parker (Think about it--she's trading riffs with the great Maceo), her cover of Bonnie Raitt's &quot;I Can't Make You Love Me&quot; where her sax replaces Bonnie's voice, and the cover of AWB's &quot;Pick Up The Pieces&quot;--if you are able to get the US version of this album (or the Japanese import, &quot;The Best Of Candy Dulfer--Candy Funky Mix&quot;), you get a no-holds barred, punched up version that's better than the Euro version. The quietness of &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; completes the album.\n\nAmong my Candy collection, I've always considered this her best album--I've always suspected that &quot;Saxuality&quot; was rushed out to jump on her newfound popularity at the time, whereas &quot;Sax-A-Go-Go&quot; was much more prepared and allowed many listeners to begin to see what she liked to play.\n\nIf you can find the US version of this, it also contains a radio edit of &quot;2 Funky&quot;--not even close to being as good as the long version, but the album makes up for it with &quot;Pick Up The Pieces&quot; (Which has become another concert staple for her). Worth it for the music, worth it for the cover.[/quote]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Candy Dulfer - Sax-A-Go-Go (RCA 66248)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Candy Dulfer\nAlbum................: Sax-A-Go-Go (RCA 66248)\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 100 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
