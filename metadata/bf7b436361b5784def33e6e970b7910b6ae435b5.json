On unencrypted BitTorrent, it sometimes occurred within the initial handshake right after my host sent a full BitTorrent bitfield (which indicates that I am a seeder).  As the RST in the middle of a conversation is a sign that the remote end crashed, seeing it happen all the time meant this had to be a fake.  \n\n1.0.0 is the latest version as of March 31, 2008.  It culminates many dedicated years of development and contributions on the Etheral and Wireshark projects.  Please support it with your upload bytes or by looking at Cace Technologies commercial products when you need other networking tools.\n\nWith sincere thanks to everyone who worked on Wireshark,\n\nRobb Topolski","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf7b436361b5784def33e6e970b7910b6ae435b5","amp;dn":"wireshark-setup-1.0.0.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf7b436361b5784def33e6e970b7910b6ae435b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,123,67,99,97,181,120,77,239,51,230,233,112,183,145,11,106,228,53,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
