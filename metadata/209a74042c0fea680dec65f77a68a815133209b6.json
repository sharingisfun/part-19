Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell are sent to visit their aunt Claire Dearing, the park's operations manager, but she is busy and has her assistant look after them. InGen's geneticists have created a new genetically modified dinosaur called Indominus rex made from the DNA of several predatory dinosaurs, as well as modern animals such as cuttlefish and tree frogs. Dr. Henry Wu, the park's chief geneticist, keeps this mixture a secret. Simon Masrani, the park's owner, orders Velociraptor trainer Owen Grady to inspect the IndominusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹ enclosure before its exhibit opens. Claire and Owen butt heads over Claire's controlling nature and their failed past relationship, but Owen agrees to inspect the cage.\n\nVic Hoskins, the head of InGen security, is interested in training the park's four Velociraptors for military use, but Owen argues that raptors cannot be fully tamed. Gray and Zach snake away to explore Jurassic World's attractions on their own. When Owen arrives at the Indominus enclosure, he and Claire find that the Indominus has seemingly scaled the wall and escaped. Owen and two other staff enter the enclosure, but the Indominus ambushes them, having faked its escape. It kills both staff before escaping, though Owen survives.\n\nMasrani orders armed security to capture the Indominus, but it kills them. Claire orders the island evacuated. Gray and Zach enter the &quot;gyrosphere&quot; ride, but ignoring the evacuation order, drive it into a forest. They are confronted by the Indominus but they escape and eventually discover the ruins of the original Jurassic Park Visitor Center. They repair a Jeep and drive back to the park. They are followed by Owen and Claire, who are attacked by the Indominus, but they survive. The Indominus continues its rampage, killing several Apatosaurus for sport and breaking into the park's pterosaur aviary. Masrani and two soldiers hunt the Indominus in a helicopter, but it crashes, killing everyone aboard. Gray and Zach return to the main park as pterosaurs attack tourists. Owen and Claire are reunited with Gray and Zach, while more armed troops shoot the pterosaurs.\n\nHoskins assumes command of Jurassic World and decides to use the Velociraptors to find and kill the Indominus. Owen reluctantly agrees. The raptors follow the IndominusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹ scent into the jungle, and Owen and a handful of InGen soldiers launch an attack. However, the Indominus is able to communicate with the raptors and turns them against the soldiers. Owen rekindles his bond with one, but it is killed. Meanwhile, Hoskins has Dr. Wu board a helicopter with dinosaur embryos and leave the park, protecting his research. Returning to the main park, Owen, Claire, Zach and Gray find Hoskins packing up the remaining dinosaur embryos. Hoskins plans to create more genetically modified dinosaurs to use as weapons, but he is attacked and killed by a raptor.\n\nOwen leads Claire, Zach, and Gray outside, and they are confronted by the other raptors. Owen reestablishes a connection with them. The Indominus appears, but the raptors, rebonded to Owen, attack it, resulting in two raptors being killed. Realizing they are outmatched, Claire lures the park's veteran Tyrannosaurus rex into a fight with the Indominus. Although the T. rex is initially overpowered, the last surviving raptor, &quot;Blue&quot;, aids the Tyrannosaurus. They force the overwhelmed Indominus towards the Jurassic World Lagoon, where the Mosasaurus drags it into the water, drowning it. The Tyrannosaurus departs, with Blue following. The next day, the surviving tourists are evacuated to Costa Rica. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents, while Owen and Claire decide to stay together. On Isla Nublar, the T. rex surveys the destruction caused by the Indominus.\n\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:209a74042c0fea680dec65f77a68a815133209b6","amp;dn":"Jurassic+World+%5B2015%5D+HDCam+-+CameraAngleCorrected.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"209a74042c0fea680dec65f77a68a815133209b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,154,116,4,44,15,234,104,13,236,101,247,122,104,168,21,19,50,9,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
