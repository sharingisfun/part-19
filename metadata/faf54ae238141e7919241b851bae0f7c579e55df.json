After beginning her career as a drummer or backup singer for some Los Angeles music groups, she achieved international recognition in the early 80s as lead singer of the new wave group The Go-Go's. The Go-Go's made history as the first all-woman band that both entirerly wrote their own songs and played their own instruments to top the Billboard album charts.[1]\n\nIn 1985 the group disbanded and she started a successful solo career. Her first solo single &quot;Mad About You&quot; (1986) reached the top three in the U.S. and topped the Canadian chart. In 1987 Carlisle started working with producer and songwriter Rick Nowles and she changed her music and public image to a more mature style. Her most successful single to date, &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot; (1987), reached the number one position in several countries among which the U.S. and the U.K..\n\nAfter the 80s her career started to decline but she returned to prominence in 1996 with the Album &quot;A Woman and A Man&quot; that spawned two top 10 singles in the U.K.. In 2001 she rejoined the Go-Go's and since then she has been touring regularly either with them or alone.\n\nSo far Belinda Carlisle has released four studio albums (and eleven singles) with the Go-Go's and seven studio albums (and thirty-one singles) as a solo artist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer Greatest Hits 1992\n\n\nThe Best of Belinda, Volume 1 is the fifth album by American singer Belinda Carlisle, released in 1992 (see 1992 in music) by Virgin Records. It is a best of compilation album, a collection of Carlisle's hits from 1986 to 1991. It is the only Carlisle album to have topped the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Heaven is a Place on Earth&quot;\n2.\t&quot;I Get Weak&quot;\n3.\t&quot;I Feel the Magic&quot;\n4.\t&quot;Half the World&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Gotta Get to You&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Leave a Light On&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Circle in the Sand&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Mad About You&quot;\n9.\t&quot;I Feel Free&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Summer Rain&quot;\n11.\t&quot;Live Your Life Be Free&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Vision of You&quot;\n13.\t&quot;Do You Feel Like I Feel?&quot;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf54ae238141e7919241b851bae0f7c579e55df","amp;dn":"Belinda+Carlisle+-+Her+Greatest+Hits+1992+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf54ae238141e7919241b851bae0f7c579e55df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,245,74,226,56,20,30,121,25,36,27,133,27,174,15,124,87,158,85,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
