In any case, take it away, Wikipedia!\n\nSnog is a band that was formed by Australian musician David Thrussell, along with fellow art school friends Tim McGrath and Julia Bourke in 1989. The band's music is a fusion of many different styles, including industrial, techno, ambient, experimental, funk and country music. The band name is a reference to &quot;kissing and cuddling,&quot; and Thrussell has stated that the name symbolizes the Marxist concept of destroying barriers between people. Thrussell's songs frequently contain themes of anti-capitalism, anti-fascism, anti-consumerism, individuality and anti-big-brotherism.\n\nLies Inc. is Snog's first long play album, released in 1992. Snog albums used to frequently come with copyleft markings (not so much these days), so I guess this one's free for all, eh?\n\nFormat: FLAC\n\n1. Spermy Man\n2. Corporate Slave\n3. Shop\n4.
