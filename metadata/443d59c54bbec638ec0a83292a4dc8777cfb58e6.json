Firstly, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cox himself, an enthused and interesting host, who explains things well and really helps make accessible the material. Secondly, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the utterly stunning visuals. The BBC has mixed in CGI along with images sent directly from space to quite breathtaking effect.\n\nPresented by Professor Brian Cox, the series takes time to investigate the solar system around us, and the many natural beauties contained within it. Across the episodes, Cox covers the likes of planets themselves, the rings of Saturn, the question of whether weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re alone in the universe, and the sun itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by: Brian Cox   \n=======================\n\n\nDirected &amp; Written by : Gideon Bradshaw\n========================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: Wonders Of The Solar System[Episode I Of V]Empire Of The Sun\nYear.................: 2010\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:58:27\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 132 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1315 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................: External English\nFile Size:...........: 549 MB\nFPS..................: 29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 7 March 2010      &lt;&lt;&lt;----- NOTE\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisodes:\n=========\n\n1)Empire Of The Sun\n2)Order Out Of Chaos\n3)The Thin Blue Line\n4)Dead Or Alive\n5)Aliens\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1611787/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1611787/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:443d59c54bbec638ec0a83292a4dc8777cfb58e6","amp;dn":"Wonders+Of+The+Solar+System%5BEpisode+I+Of+V%5D-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"443d59c54bbec638ec0a83292a4dc8777cfb58e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,61,89,197,75,190,198,56,236,10,131,41,42,77,200,119,124,251,88,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
