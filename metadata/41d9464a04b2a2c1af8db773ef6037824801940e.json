With separate chapters on the nature and use of criminological theory as well as theoretical application, the authors render the difficult task of explaining crime more understandable to the introductory student. All of the main theories in criminology are reviewed including classical and rational choice, biological, psychological, and evolutionary, social structural, social process, critical, general, and integrated approaches. Copious examples of the spirit of the theories are supplied, many with a popular culture (e.g., film and music) connection. \n\nJanuary 2010\nPublisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.\nFormat: Hardcover 192pp \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41d9464a04b2a2c1af8db773ef6037824801940e","amp;dn":"Explaining+Crime%3A+A+Primer+in+Criminological+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41d9464a04b2a2c1af8db773ef6037824801940e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,217,70,74,4,178,162,193,175,141,183,115,239,96,55,130,72,1,148,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
