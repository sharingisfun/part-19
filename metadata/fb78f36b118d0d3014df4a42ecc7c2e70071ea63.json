Released with the newspaper &quot;Ethnos&quot; in 2012.\n\n\n\nREVIEW\n\nAround the same time that Columbia released &quot;The Essential Bob Dylan&quot; in the US, it also released &quot;The Best of Bob Dylan Volume 2&quot; in most overseas markets, a sequel to Volume 1 which was released in 1997.\n\n&quot;The Best of Bob Dylan Volume 2&quot; (17 tracks, 77 min., plus bonus disk) starts off with the 'excuse' that was needed for the release, namely the excellent (and Oscar-winning) &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; from the &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; soundtrack. After that, the remaining 16 tracks provide a chronological overview of Dylan's best known songs not found on Volume 1, and thus form a perfect complement to Volume 1. \nThe highlights are many, including &quot;A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall&quot;, &quot;I Want You&quot;, &quot;Simple Twist of Faith&quot;, &quot;Changing of the Guards&quot; (all of which are missing from &quot;The Essential Bob Dylan&quot;), &quot;Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Rainy Day Woman&quot;, and so on. The audio quality is superb. \nIn all, this is an excellent compilation. Highly recomended!
