First recorded by jazz trombonist Kai Winding and his Orchestra in 1963, it was covered (with additional lyrics by Jimmy Norman) by both soul singer Irma Thomas and The Rolling Stones in 1964.\n\nThe Rolling Stones recorded two versions of the song in 1964. The first version (a looser arrangement featuring a briefer, organ-only intro), recorded in London in June 1964, was released in the U.S. in 1964, as a single from their album 12 X 5. The second version (more tightly arranged and featuring guitar in the intro), recorded in Chicago on November 8, 1964, was released in the UK on January 15, 1965 on The Rolling Stones No. 2. This is the version that receives airplay and appears on most &quot;best of&quot; compilations. Both versions incorporate elements of Irma Thomas's recording, including spoken-word interjections in the chorus, a monologue in the middle of the song, and distinctive lead guitar.\n\nThe U.S. version was released on September 26, 1964 as a single (a month after Thomas' cover) and peaked at number six on the U.S. Billboard Pop Singles Chart to become the Rolling Stones' first top ten hit in the U.S. (their previous single, &quot;It's All Over Now&quot;, had only peaked at number 26). \n\nWhen they performed &quot;Time Is on My Side&quot; during their first guest spot on The Ed Sullivan Show, Sullivan was shocked by their appearance, because long hair on men was considered outrageous to older people in the US at that time, and declared that they would never be invited onto the show again, but he subsequently invited them back several times.\n\nThe Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. In the vanguard of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US from 1964 ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ 65 and symbols of rebellious youth, the Rolling Stones were also instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll, and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the more primitive blues typified by John Lee Hooker and by Chess Records artists such as Muddy Waters, writer of &quot;Rollin' Stone&quot;, the song after which the band is named.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list and their estimated album sales are above 200 million. They have released twenty-four studio albums, eleven live albums and numerous compilations. Sticky Fingers (1971) was their first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the United States. In 2008 the Rolling Stones ranked 10th on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists&quot; chart.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Is_on_My_Side&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Is_on_My_Side&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaidgAafc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaidgAafc&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:47\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
