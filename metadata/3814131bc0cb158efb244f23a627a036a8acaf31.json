The double album was issued on 7 June 1976 in the United States, on Capitol Records (catalogue number SKBO 11537), and on Parlophone (PCSP 719) in the United Kingdom, four days later; at the time, some in the media speculated that the album was released to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the first meeting between John Lennon and Paul McCartney. (If that was indeed the intention, EMI miscalculated, as the two actually first met in July 1957.) The title, Rock 'n' Roll Music, presumably came from the song of the same name by Chuck Berry, The Beatles' version of which is included on side two of the original two-record set. The album is primarily made up of cover versions of songs written by significant rock and roll composers of the '50s, including Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins and Larry Williams, although some notable LennonÃ¢â‚¬â€œMcCartney originals, such as &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot; are included also. Rock 'n' Roll Music was the first Beatles album to include &quot;I'm Down&quot;, which had previously only been available as the B-side of the &quot;Help!&quot; single \n\nControversy surrounded the album's artwork, which featured an embossed colour portrait of The Beatles against a shiny silver background, with the album's title spelled out in what is presumed to be neon lights. Symbols of the 1950s were used on the inside of the album's gatefold sleeve, including a jukebox, an outdoor movie screen with a picture of Marilyn Monroe, a 1957 Chevrolet, a cheeseburger, and a glass of Coca-Cola. 1950s nostalgia was at a peak when the album was released and Capitol was clearly attempting to cash in on the trend. As The Beatles were a '60s band, the album cover prompted Ringo Starr to complain to Rolling Stone: &quot;It made us look cheap and we never were cheap. All that Coca-Cola and cars with big fins was the Fifties!&quot; Lennon was also critical of the artwork and wrote an angry letter to Capitol Records saying it &quot;looks like a Monkees reject&quot; and instead suggested the use of photos by Astrid Kirchherr or JÃƒÂ¼rgen Vollmer, both of whom had photographed the band during their Hamburg days.Lennon had also offered to design the cover himself, but was declined.\n\nAlbum sales benefited from a rather significant wave of Beatles nostalgia that was taking place during the summer of 1976. Interest in the band was undoubtedly boosted by Paul McCartney's &quot;Wings over America&quot; tour, which criss-crossed the United States and Canada shortly after Rock 'n' Roll Music was released. In addition, sales were not hurt by the fact that the album included the song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, of which a cover version had been spotlighted in a made-for-television movie on the 1969 Charles Manson murders that aired shortly before the album was released. Rock 'n' Roll Music hit number 2 on the Billboard 200 in the US (kept off the top spot by McCartney's Wings at the Speed of Sound), and number 11 on the UK's Top 60 Albums Chart.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_Music_%28album%29#Track_listing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_Music_%28album%29#Track_listing&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3814131bc0cb158efb244f23a627a036a8acaf31","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Rock+n+Roll+Music+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3814131bc0cb158efb244f23a627a036a8acaf31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,20,19,27,192,203,21,142,251,36,79,35,166,39,160,54,168,172,175,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
