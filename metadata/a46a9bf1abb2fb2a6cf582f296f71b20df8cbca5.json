It was recorded extremely quickly in September 1970 following the band's success at the Isle of Wight Festival but with an attitude of relaxation, the band having achieved worldwide success with their previous album &quot;Fire and Water&quot; and the single &quot;All Right Now&quot;. It is a low-key and introspective album compared with its predecessors.\n\n\n      Paul Francis Kossoff (14 September 1950 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 19 March 1976) was an English rock guitarist best known as a member of the band Free. Kossoff was ranked 51st in Rolling Stone magazine list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Kossoff started playing the guitar in the mid-1960s, being taught by session guitarist Colin Falconer, and at age 15 helped to found the band Black Cat Bones. The band played with touring blues piano player Champion Jack Dupree, did many supporting shows for Fleetwood Mac and other gigs with Fleetwood Mac cofounder Peter Green. Kossoff jammed and spent hours discussing blues playing and players. Kossoff's bandmate in Black Cat Bones was drummer Simon Kirke, and the two went on to play on Champion Jack Dupree's April 1968 album &quot;When You Feel the Feeling You Was Feeling&quot;.\n       In April 1968 Kossoff and Kirke teamed up with Paul Rodgers (vocals) and Andy Fraser (bass) to form Free. They did the Transit circuit for two years and recorded two albums: Tons of Sobs (1968) and Free (1969). Both albums showcased the band's blues- and soul-influenced sound, a style which was in contrast to some of their progressive and heavier counterparts at the time. Success came in 1970 when their third album, Fire and Water (1970), spawned the big hit &quot;All Right Now&quot;.    \n       Kossoff's unhappiness with the end of Free and his drug addictions contributed to a drastic decline in the guitarist's health. On a flight from Los Angeles to New York on 19 March 1976, Kossoff died from drug-related heart problems. He was cremated and interred at the Golders Green Crematorium. His epitaph reads &quot;All Right Now&quot;.\n    \n      Following Kossoff's death his father, actor David Kossoff, established the Paul Kossoff Foundation which aimed to present the realities of drug addiction to children. Kossoff's father spent the remainder of his life campaigning against drugs, touring a one-man stage performance about the death of Paul and its effect on the family.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a46a9bf1abb2fb2a6cf582f296f71b20df8cbca5","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+546","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a46a9bf1abb2fb2a6cf582f296f71b20df8cbca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,106,155,241,171,178,251,42,108,245,130,242,150,247,27,32,223,140,188,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
