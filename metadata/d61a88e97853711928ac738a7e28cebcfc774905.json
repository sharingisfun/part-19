Just one of\nthe thousands of recent examples of this type of acting done for the public was President Bill ClintonÃƒÂ¢??s\n1995 State of the Union address. The speech was designed to push all of the warm fuzzy buttons of his\nlistening audience that he could. All the green lights for acceptance were systematically pushed by the\nPresidentÃƒÂ¢??s speech with the help of a controlled congressional audience. The truth on the other hand\ndoesnÃƒÂ¢??t always tickle the ear and warm the ego of its listeners. The light of truth in this book will be\ntoo bright for some people who will want to return to the safe comfort of their darkness.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d61a88e97853711928ac738a7e28cebcfc774905","amp;dn":"Springmeier+-+Bloodlines+of+Illuminati+by+Fritz+Springmeier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d61a88e97853711928ac738a7e28cebcfc774905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,26,136,233,120,83,113,25,40,172,115,138,126,40,206,188,252,119,73,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
