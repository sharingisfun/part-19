Though he hates the mother, he marries her as this is the only way to be close to the girl, who will prove to be too mature for her age. They start a journey together, trying to hide they're not just (step)father and daughter, throughout the country, being followed by someone whom Humbert first suspects to be from the police. The profound jealousy, and maybe some guilt from the forbidden love, seem slowly to drive the man emotionally labile.\n\nGeneral\nContainer:\tMPEG-PS\nVideo\nCodec:\tMPEG-2\nResolution:\t720x480 ~&gt; 853x480\nAspect ratio:\t16:9\nFrame rate:\t29.970 fps\nBit rate:\t4 989 Kbps\nAudio\n#1:\t5.1ch AC-3 @ 448 Kbps\n#2:\t2.0ch AC-3 @ 192 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beda03c9ea91838dfb9210ea21098d4437b4e385","amp;dn":"Lolita+1997%5BDVD+%2F+NTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beda03c9ea91838dfb9210ea21098d4437b4e385","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,218,3,201,234,145,131,141,251,146,16,234,33,9,141,68,55,180,227,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
