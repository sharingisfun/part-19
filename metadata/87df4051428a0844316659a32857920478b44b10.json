What a hell of a decade that was. Puffball skirts, fantastical movies (Ghostbusters, The Neverending Story, Labrynth), Kylie warbling about being so lucky, lucky, luckyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦amongst all the fluff and bright colours it can be easy to forget the huge influence the Eighties had on music, and rock music in particular. For one, so-called Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhair metalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ emerged kicking and screaming from the Sunset Strip to encompass other types of rock and become a powerful genre of its own, producing such enduring acts as Motley Crue, Poison and even the likes of Bon Jovi and Europe. More than thirty years later (bet that makes you feel old!) not only a large amount of these groups still going these days, but most are in terrific shape (Chinese Democracy asideÃ¢â‚¬Â¦).\n\n\nRecently there has been a resurgence in popularity for the Eighties, with bands such as Kiss, Def Leppard soon to be on tour together and the gloriously naughty and kitch Steel Panther taking their cue from classic hair metal. This seems to have signified the realisation that many have always known: Eighties rock and metal was AWESOME, man.\n\n\nNorthern IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Maverick are definitely a band that are aware of this previously unpopular fact. Forming just over two years ago, they self-released EP Ã¢â‚¬ËœTalkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CheapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shortly after and spent the next year gigging their wee hearts out, gaining huge popularity locally and supporting acts such as Tigertailz, Faster Pussycat and Cheap Thrill. November 28th this year will see them release their eagerly anticipated debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœQuid Pro QuoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ through Massacre Records, to whom they recently signed.\n\nAnd my goodness, what a cracker of an album it is, too. Opening with a warning siren and battering ram drums (on intro Ã¢â‚¬ËœEvent HorizonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) it pins its flag to the mast from very first track Ã¢â‚¬ËœSnakeskin SinnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The song has an immediately recognisable classic rock feel, with a chugging beat and some gnarly guitar work, while vocalist David BalfourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal style is raw, brawny and simply perfect for this type of music.\n\n\nLead single Ã¢â‚¬ËœPaint By Numbers (which already has over 6,000 views on youtube) is next, offering a snarling riff and groovy beat throughout. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite masculine backing vocals lend the song a rather streetwise, macho air Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no insipid Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdelicate flowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stuff here! Even the Ã¢â‚¬ËœromanticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ songs on the album (Ã¢â‚¬ËœGot It BadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLast AddictionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ etc) avoid falling into the trap of being slushy, whilst the more, shall we say Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbase urgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are presented with a sly wink and a cheeky grin (the Stone Sour-esque Ã¢â‚¬ËœElectricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with its admonition Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why deny desire, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a long time deadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœearly MotleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sounding Ã¢â‚¬ËœRock n Roll LadyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are perfect examples).\n\n\nFar from being lyrical one-trick ponies, Maverick have also included a few Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcall to armsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ numbers: the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmiddle fingers upÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rant of Ã¢â‚¬ËœIn Our BloodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with its rallying cry of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our true love, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rock n rollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the perky and upbeat Ã¢â‚¬ËœSide By SideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. They also delve into personal issues of loss, regret and shame on tracks such as Ã¢â‚¬ËœTook the NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the closest thing to a power ballad on Quid Pro Quo, and album highlight Ã¢â‚¬ËœShackled Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ, with its urgent lyrics, Thin Lizzy-esque intro and powerful outro. Songs such as these two hint intriguingly at MaverickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darker side, both musically and lyrically.\n\nFrankly, QPQ is a hell of a ride from start to finish. The songs are varied and interesting, yet maintain their classic song structure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ well if it ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t broke, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix it, right? Each song is catchy as hell, resulting in joyfully involuntary toe-tapping and head-nodding throughout.\n\n\nMusically, the band members smash each track out of the park, while Balfour is simply a delight to listen to, combining the range and rawness of Sebastian Bach with the power and pleasing timbre of John Parr (him what sung Ã¢â‚¬ËœSt ElmoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, FYI). And although they clearly take their inspiration from Eighties hair metal, they fall into the burlier end of the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spectrum: less Poison/Nelson, more GnR/Whitesnake. Maverick are living proof that the influence that Eighties music has had on modern rock music cannot be overstated Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and long may it remain so.\n\nLine-up:\nLead Vocals: David Balfour\nGuitar: Ryan Sebastian Balfour\nGuitar: Ric Cardwell\nBass: Richie Diver\nDrums: Mike Ross\n\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nTalk's Cheap [EP]     2013\nQuid Pro Quo     2014\n\n\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
