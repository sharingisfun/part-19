As he approached his adolescence, Joel started to rebel, joining teenage street gangs and boxing as welterweight. He fought a total of 22 fights as a teenager, and during one of the fights, he broke his nose. For the early years of his adolescence, he divided his time between studying piano and fighting. Upon seeing the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, Joel decided to pursue a full-time musical career and set about finding a local Long Island band to join. Eventually, he found the Echoes, a group that specialized in British Invasion covers. the Echoes became a popular New York attraction, convincing him to quit high school to become a professional musician. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.88% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia\nCatalog:\t\tCK 67347\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Keeping The Faith\n02.An Innocent Man\n03.A Matter Of Trust\n04.Baby Grand (Duet With Ray Charles)\n05.This Is The Time\n06.Leningrad\n07.We Didn't Start The Fire\n08.I Go To Extremes\n09.And So It Goes\n10.The Downeaster Alexa\n11.Shameless\n12.All About Soul (Remix)\n13.Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\n14.The River Of Dreams\n15.To Make You Feel My Love\n16.Hey Girl\n17.Light As The Breeze\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ad3a1934dfc345e8231771cc6b4f09c12c3871e","amp;dn":"Billy+Joel+-+Greatest+Hits+Vol.+3+%281997%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ad3a1934dfc345e8231771cc6b4f09c12c3871e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,211,161,147,77,252,52,94,130,49,119,28,198,180,240,156,18,195,135,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
