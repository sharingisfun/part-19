You must use your wits and possibly a flask of tea to stay alive.\n\nSir is a sandbox experience, where each playthrough is completely different, thanks to our British Countryside Generator. Choose how you escape from the islands: using violence, or using trickery and stealth. This brutal and unforgiving test of your mettle is now available for Windows, OSX, and Linux.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed7bf05ca8a4a610eba10bfd445f76a1a39f08c","amp;dn":"Sir%2C+You+Are+Being+Hunted+Alpha+v.0.3.4518","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ed7bf05ca8a4a610eba10bfd445f76a1a39f08c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,215,191,5,202,138,74,97,14,186,16,191,212,69,247,106,26,57,240,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
