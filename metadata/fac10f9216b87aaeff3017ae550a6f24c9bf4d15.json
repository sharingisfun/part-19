Pascente and Spilotro grew up together on Chicagoâ€™s Near West Side, and as young toughs they were rousted and shaken down by Hanhardt. While Spilotro became one of the youngest made men in Chicago Outfit history, Pascente was draftÂ­ed into the army and then joined the police department. Soon taken under Hanhardtâ€™s wing, Pascente served as Hanhardtâ€™s fixer and bagman on the department for more than a decade. At the same time, Pascente remained close to Spilotro, makÂ­ing frequent trips to Las Vegas to party with his old friend while helping to rob the casinos blind. As a policeman he led a double life, doing genuine police work unÂ­der Hanhardtâ€™s tutelage while at the same time keeping an eye out for opportunities for bribery and theft. His position on both sides of the law gave him unrivaled knowlÂ­edge of the workings of Chicagoâ€™s deeply rooted culture of corruption.\r\n\r\nMob Cop details the decline of traÂ­ditional organized crime in the United States, and reveals information about the inner workings of the Outfit that has never been publicly released. Fred Pascenteâ€™s colÂ­orful stories of crooked cops and dangerÂ­ous criminals make his memoir a matchless tell-all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fac10f9216b87aaeff3017ae550a6f24c9bf4d15","amp;dn":"Mob+Cop+-+My+Life+of+Crime+in+the+Chicago+Police+Department+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fac10f9216b87aaeff3017ae550a6f24c9bf4d15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,193,15,146,22,184,122,174,255,48,23,174,85,10,111,36,201,191,77,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
