The band's music eludes classification, expertly blending percussive guitar work and silky harmonies, seeking the silver lining yet to be discovered between the sounds we know and love. With a wash of 90s sonic pop drawn from artists like Pale Saints, Cocteau Twins and McCarthy, Violens paint soft watercolor notes across their compositions, adding crucial emotional depth via layered vocal harmonies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e75296a3636ae6c80593a695aaade5fe253af1","amp;dn":"Violens+-+True+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e75296a3636ae6c80593a695aaade5fe253af1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,231,82,150,163,99,106,230,200,5,147,166,149,170,173,229,254,37,58,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
