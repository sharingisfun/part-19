Cardio-pulmonary exercise (CPEX) tests are therefore an increasingly common component of pre-operative assessment and the management of patients with chronic cardiopulmonary problems. Part of the Oxford Respiratory Medicine Library (ORML) series, this pocketbook guides clinicians through the parameters measured in CPEX testing so that they can understand the underlying physiology and are able to interpret the results. Clinical scenarios, common patterns, key points, and practical tips all make this book easy to follow, even for those readers who have little prior knowledge of the subject.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4ad7f85e8b9318280abd9568cf6dcc4a33d506a","amp;dn":"A+Practical+Guide+to+the+Interpretation+of+Cardio-Pulmonary+Exer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4ad7f85e8b9318280abd9568cf6dcc4a33d506a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,173,127,133,232,185,49,130,128,171,217,86,140,246,220,196,163,61,80,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
