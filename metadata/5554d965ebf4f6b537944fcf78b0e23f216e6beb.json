Only a few hundred\n     copies of the LP were ever pressed, and only a handful seem to\n     have survived. Moreover, the LP outdoes all expectations.\n     Performed on the synths that would later define Acid House, the\n     Roland TB-303 and TR-808, the album sounds light years ahead of\n     its time with its repetitive beats and hypnotic electronic\n     melodies. Its maker, Bollywood session musician Charanjit Singh,\n     set out to translate ancient Indian classical Ragas to the modern\n     synthesizer and in doing so seems to have invented House music\n     along the way. The 10 tracks make a consistent listen from A to Z.\n     Its restrained minimalism and lack of cheesiness makes it\n     incredibly contemporary, sounding animated, fluid and unabashedly\n     alive.\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bombay-connection.com/en_GB/site/page/1/releases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bombay-connection.com/en_GB/site/page/1/releases&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n     p l a y l i s t\n\n\n\n     01    Raga Bhairav                                      04:56\n     02    Raga Lalit                                        04:52\n     03    Raga Bhupali                                      04:50\n     04    Raga Todi                                         04:49\n     05    Raga Madhuvanti                                   04:56\n     06    Raga Megh Malhar                                  04:58\n     07    Raga Yaman                                        05:03\n     08    Raga Kalavati                                     05:05\n     09    Raga Malkauns                                     04:59\n     10    Raga Bairagi                                      05:07\n\n                                                             49:35 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5554d965ebf4f6b537944fcf78b0e23f216e6beb","amp;dn":"Charanjit_Singh-Ten_Ragas_to_A_Disco_Beat-WEB-2010-DPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5554d965ebf4f6b537944fcf78b0e23f216e6beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,84,217,101,235,244,246,181,55,148,79,207,120,176,226,63,33,110,107,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
