Jack Pearson was still in the neighborhood, and sits in on three songs. Warren introduces &quot;blues hour&quot; as Jack comes out for a triple-guitar run through &quot;Dimples,&quot; &quot;Key To the Highway&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot; that stands as one of the highlights of the summer. If you like extended jams, you need to hear these! A righteous &quot;Elizabeth Reed&quot; is another treat from this special night.\n\nINSTANT LIVE CD [320k MP3]\n\n\nDISC ONE\nMountain Jam  22:56\n\nTrouble No More  3:29\n\nMidnight Rider  3:13\n\nRockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Horse  10:12\n\nDone Somebody Wrong  3:45\n\n \n\nDISC TWO\n\nThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down  5:12\n\n*Dimples  11:13\n\n*Key To the Highway  9:05\n\n*Good Morning Little Schoolgirl  12:14\n\nStand Back  5:59\n\n \n\nDISC THREE\n\nStatesboro Blues  5:07\n\nIn Memory of Elizabeth Reed  37:24\n\nOne Way Out  10:59\n\n* w/ Jack Pearson, guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ae2b6022d8557fb919909bd3b88da36d869c0ed","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+08-19-2005+%5B320k+MP3%5D+Scranton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ae2b6022d8557fb919909bd3b88da36d869c0ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,226,182,2,45,133,87,251,145,153,9,189,59,136,218,54,216,105,192,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
