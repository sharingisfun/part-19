The work, showing the author's interest in the theories of Sigmund Freud, is written in the form of the memoirs of one Zeno Cosini, who writes them at the insistence of his psychoanalyst. Schmitz's novel received almost no attention from Italian readers and critics at the time.\n\nThe work might have disappeared altogether if it were not for the efforts of James Joyce. Joyce had met Schmitz in 1907, when Joyce tutored him in English while working for Berlitz in Trieste. Joyce read Schmitz's earlier novel SenilitÃƒÂ , which had also been largely ignored when published in 1898. Joyce championed Confessions of Zeno, helping to have it translated into French and then published in Paris, where critics praised it extravagantly. That led Italian critics, including Eugenio Montale, to discover it. Zeno Cosini, the book's hero, mirrored Schmitz, being a businessman fascinated by Freudian theory.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* A Life, Translated from the Italian by Archibald Colquhoun (2012, Pushkin Press)\n\n* The Nice Old Man and the Pretty Girl,Translated from Italian by L.
