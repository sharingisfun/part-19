In part-one of the reunion, Asa and GG are in a room together for the first time since the terrible knife-wielding dinner party and apology-gone-wrong in the season finale. Accusations fly about out-of-control-lifestyles plus behind the scenes revelations about MJ's criminal past.\n\n\n\nThanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d034876c49ad1421beb1fe1c1cff133b3d3ac32b","amp;dn":"Shahs.Of.Sunset.S02E11.Reunion.Part.1.HDTV.x264-RKSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d034876c49ad1421beb1fe1c1cff133b3d3ac32b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,52,135,108,73,173,20,33,190,177,254,28,28,255,19,59,61,58,195,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
