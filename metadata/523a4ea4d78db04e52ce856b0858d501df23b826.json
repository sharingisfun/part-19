The lineup came together in 2009, when songwriters Jonathan Russell and Josiah Johnson met at an open mike event at Seattle's Conor Byrne Pub. Pianist Kenny Hensley, bassist Chris Zasche, violinist Charity Rose Thielen, and former Prabir &amp; the Substitutes drummer Tyler Williams rounded out the roster, and the Head and the Heart spent the first half of 2010 touring the Pacific Northwest before self-releasing their eponymous debut in June. By the end of the summer, they'd created enough buzz in the Pacific Northwest to entertain offers from several record labels, eventually signing with Sub Pop that fall and reissuing their album -- this time with remastered tracks and one new song -- in early 2011.  The band spent much of their time on tour during 2012 and subsequently began the writing process for their second album on the road. They eventually returned to Seattle to record their sophomore release, 2013's Let's Be Still.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523a4ea4d78db04e52ce856b0858d501df23b826","amp;dn":"The+Head+and+the+Heart+-+Let%27s+Be+Still+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523a4ea4d78db04e52ce856b0858d501df23b826","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,58,78,164,215,141,176,78,82,206,133,107,8,88,213,1,223,35,184,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
