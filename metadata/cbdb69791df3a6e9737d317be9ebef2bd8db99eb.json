The original release of the album features only nine of the songs from the movie, many of them heavily edited. The album spent over two years (118 weeks) on the Billboard 200 chart. In 1999 a 16-track re-release coincided with the concert's 15th anniversary.\n\nByrne's intention was not to make a traditional soundtrack album, but to have it be a separate experience. Limited pressings of the original LP version featured a full color picture book wrapped around the album jacket. Regular versions had many of the pictures and captions on the album's inner sleeve. In 1999, to correspond with the theatrical re-release of the movie, the album was extended and remastered, restoring all of the songs from the movie with only very minor edits. The newly included tracks feature Frantz's original drumming from the concert recordings. In 2003, the album was ranked number 345 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nDavid Byrne ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals\nChris Frantz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, vocals\nJerry Harrison ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, keyboards, vocals\nTina Weymouth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, guitar, keyboards, vocals\nBernie Worrell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards\nAlex Weir ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals\nSteve Scales ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\nEdnah Holt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals\nLynn Mabry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\nAll songs written by David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth except as noted.\n\n1.&quot;Psycho Killer&quot; (Byrne, Frantz, Weymouth) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n2.&quot;Swamp&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 \n3.&quot;Slippery People&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13 \n4.&quot;Burning Down the House&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n5.&quot;Girlfriend Is Better&quot; (Byrne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07 \n6.&quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (Byrne, Brian Eno, Frantz, Harrison, Weymouth) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:34 \n7.&quot;What a Day That Was&quot; (Byrne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:30 \n8.&quot;Life During Wartime&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:52 \n9.&quot;Take Me to the River&quot; (Al Green, Teenie Hodges) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:59\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbdb69791df3a6e9737d317be9ebef2bd8db99eb","amp;dn":"Talking+Heads+-+Stop+Making+Sense++%5B1984%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbdb69791df3a6e9737d317be9ebef2bd8db99eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,219,105,121,29,243,166,233,115,125,49,123,233,235,239,43,216,219,153,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
