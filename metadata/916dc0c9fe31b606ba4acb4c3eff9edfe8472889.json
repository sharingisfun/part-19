The book is broken into two parts, the first deals with security-related reverse engineering and the second explores the more practical aspects of reverse engineering. In addition, the author explains how to reverse engineer a third-party software library to improve interfacing and how to reverse engineer a competitor&amp;#039;s software to build a better product.\n* The first popular book to show how software reverse engineering can help defend against security threats, speed up development, and unlock the secrets of competitive products\n* Helps developers plug security holes by demonstrating how hackers exploit reverse engineering techniques to crack copy-protection schemes and identify software targets for viruses and other malware\n* Offers a primer on advanced reverse-engineering, delving into &quot;disassembly&quot;-code-level reverse engineering-and explaining how to decipher assembly language","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:916dc0c9fe31b606ba4acb4c3eff9edfe8472889","amp;dn":"%28ebook%29+Reversing+-+The+Secrets+To+Reverse+Engineering+-+FoxoF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"916dc0c9fe31b606ba4acb4c3eff9edfe8472889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,109,192,201,254,49,182,6,186,74,203,76,62,255,158,223,232,71,40,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
