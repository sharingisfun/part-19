This practical, reader-friendly textbook has been written with undergraduates in mind, and is suitable for self-study.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c1b6240238fbd4a255da32dca63101999a6430e","amp;dn":"A+Practical+Introduction+to+Computer+Architecture+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c1b6240238fbd4a255da32dca63101999a6430e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,27,98,64,35,143,189,74,37,93,163,45,202,99,16,25,153,166,67,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
