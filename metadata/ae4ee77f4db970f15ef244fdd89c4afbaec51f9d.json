Because they see their lives as &quot;merde,&quot; they go in search of God to get their story rewritten. Along the way, believing everything is imaginary anyway, they shoot people, rob pharmacies, and tie up the residents of places they squat. They also gather a taxi full of eccentrics, including a priest, Battavia's suicidal widow, and a policewoman; various couples pair off. Soon life imitates art: the events and ellipses seem lifted from modern fiction as the group's quest for God continues. \n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116081/\n\n\nLanguage: French\nSubtitles: Portuguese\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae4ee77f4db970f15ef244fdd89c4afbaec51f9d","amp;dn":"Des+nouvelles+du+bon+Dieu+%281996%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae4ee77f4db970f15ef244fdd89c4afbaec51f9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,78,231,127,77,185,112,241,94,242,68,253,216,156,74,251,174,197,31,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
