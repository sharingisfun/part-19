Then he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor.\n\nSuddenly BryanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promising future was looking at a troubling schedule of radiation and chemotherapy. But having found refuge in comedy, &quot;Bald Bryan&quot; recounts his alternately heartbreaking and hysterical experience of cancer treatment and recovery, from writing his will with the bravado of a pulp novelist, to taking chemo in a strip club, to achieving his life-long dream of getting another woman in the shower with him and his wife (even if it was only for physical therapy). These and other charmingly twisted scenes make the serious truly a laughing matter. Now four years since his initial diagnosis, Bryan celebrates how his aggressive treatment shrunk his tumor and gave him a new lease on life.\n\nThrough odds and obstacles, blunders and dilemmas, Bryan radiates through his narrative with wonder and humor. This profound, honest, and surprisingly funny recovery audiobook is a Cancer Schmancer for the Jimmy Kimmel Live! crowd.
