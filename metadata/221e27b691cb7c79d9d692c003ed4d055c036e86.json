It was recorded in January 1959, shortly after Evans had left Miles Davis and two months before he would subsequently return for the recording dates that would comprise 'Kind of Blue.' Evans' playing here may reflect a sense of relief and newfound freedom (Davis, after all, could be a handful on a daily basis). \n\nSo much for conjecture.\n\nFor whatever reason, there is a 'looseness,' an openness, maybe even a sense of playfulness, in Evans' work on the majority of this album's cuts as Evans leads two former Davis colleagues through a series of standards. There are no inroads here, no profound explorations, to be sure; this is simply three excellent jazz practitioners doing what they do best.\n\nThe title cut, 'On Green Dolphin Street,' deserves a bit of discussion. At first blush, of course, it's more than slightly reminiscent of the Davis Sextet's earlier recording; so much so that you may find yourself waiting for Davis or Adderley or Coltrane to come in for a chorus. (It should also be noted that Jones' drumwork suffers -- on this cut alone -- by comparison with the earlier version in that he isn't called upon to vary his approach with each successive soloist.)  What elevates this version, of course, is Evans' extended passages with their subtle shifts from one chorus to the next.\n\nAs noted, there is no new ground broken with this recording, and that's fine. 'On Green Dolphin Street' chronicles Bill Evans at a particular transitional period in his career.\n\nIt also provides some mighty fine listening. ~ Paul Dana\n\nPersonnel:\nBill Evans, piano\nPaul Chambers, bass\nPhilly Joe Jones, drums\n\nBill Evans - Green Dolphin Street (1959) Tracks:\n01  You And the Night And The Music - 7:24\n02  My Heart Stood Still - 5:25\n03  Green Dolphin Street - 8:12\n04  How Am I To Know? - 6:22\n05  Woody'N You (take 1) - 4:28\n06  Woody'N You (take 2) - 4:13\n07  Loose Bloose - 5:36","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:221e27b691cb7c79d9d692c003ed4d055c036e86","amp;dn":"Bill+Evans+-+Green+Dolphin+Street+%281959%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"221e27b691cb7c79d9d692c003ed4d055c036e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,30,39,182,145,203,124,121,217,214,146,192,3,237,77,5,92,3,110,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
