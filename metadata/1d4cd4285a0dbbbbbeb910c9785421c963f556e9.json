Players build cities, castles and fortifications; construct mechanical devices and engines; perform landscaping and underground mining.\n\nThe game is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people built architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Medieval Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and history and doesn't use any technologies that were not available in the 5th to 15th centuries.\n\nMedieval Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as an action game too. We expect players to avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications. Medieval Engineers shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.\n\nMedieval Engineers is the second Ã¢â‚¬Å“engineeringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ game developed by Keen Software House. The first one is Space Engineers, which sold over 1 million copies in its first year and is still a bestseller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d4cd4285a0dbbbbbeb910c9785421c963f556e9","amp;dn":"Medieval+Engineers+v02.023.002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d4cd4285a0dbbbbbeb910c9785421c963f556e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,76,212,40,90,13,187,187,190,185,16,201,120,84,33,201,99,245,86,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
