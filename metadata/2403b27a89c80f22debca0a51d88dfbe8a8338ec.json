Needing to get background colour for his next novel, he invites local medium, the eccentric Madame Arcarti, to hold a seance at his house. The seance goes only too well, for Madame Arcarti conjurers up the spirit of his dead first wife Elvira.\n\nJust one problem - only Charles can see or hear her","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2403b27a89c80f22debca0a51d88dfbe8a8338ec","amp;dn":"Blithe+Spirit+-+Radio+Drama+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2403b27a89c80f22debca0a51d88dfbe8a8338ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,3,178,122,137,200,15,34,222,188,160,165,29,136,223,190,138,131,56,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
