Chris Hayes is the host of Up with Chris Hayes that is live at 8AM on the weekend. He also writes for The Nation. \n\nHow did we get here? With Twilight of the Elites, Christopher Hayes offers a radically novel answer. Since the 1960s, as the meritocracy elevated a more diverse group of men and women into power, they learned to embrace the accelerating inequality that had placed them near the very top. Their ascension heightened social distance and spawned a new American elite--one more prone to failure and corruption than any that came before it.\n \n   Mixing deft political analysis, timely social commentary, and deep historical understanding, Twilight of the Elites describes how the society we have come to inhabit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ utterly forgiving at the top and relentlessly punitive at the bottom Ã¢â‚¬â€œ produces leaders who are out of touch with the people they have been trusted to govern. Hayes argues that the public's failure to trust the federal government, corporate America, and the media has led to a crisis of authority that threatens to engulf not just our politics but our day-to-day lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:274b9d841d47f68476e3b99fd284bec387f74ebf","amp;dn":"Twilight+of+the+Elites+America+After+Meritocracy+by+Chris+Hayes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"274b9d841d47f68476e3b99fd284bec387f74ebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,75,157,132,29,71,246,132,118,227,185,159,210,132,190,195,135,247,78,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
