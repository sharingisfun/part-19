The Class 50 trains were not suited to the short distances between stops and suffered reliability issues. \n\nIn all, 22 units were converted into Class 159 units, incorporating modifications such as the addition of a First Class passenger section and cab modifications. The most notable improvement was a more powerful 400hp diesel engine that allowed the units to tackle some of the more challenging gradients with ease. \n\nClass 159 DMUs are formed of a leading Driving Motor Composite vehicle, incorporating the first class section, a Motor Second trailer vehicle and a reversed Driving Motor Second vehicle. These three-car sets were often coupled in units of six vehicles, allowing them to carry some 424 passengers. \n\nThe BR Class 159 for Train Simulator is available in late Network SouthEast livery and reproduces the three-car DMU as it operated for Network SouthEast following inception in 1993 and before refurbishment in 2000. Also included is an InterCity Swallow liveried High Speed Train","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:121587f2b2fa2af0c5498070a4b62c0781ef04b2","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+Network+SouthEast+Class+159+DMU+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"121587f2b2fa2af0c5498070a4b62c0781ef04b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,21,135,242,178,250,42,240,197,73,128,112,164,182,44,7,129,239,4,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
