That comes as no surprise, since the core group here literally was Muddy Waters' backup unit from 1974 to 1980: Bob Margolin and Luther &quot;Guitar Jr&quot; Johnson on guitars, Pinetop Perkins on piano, Jerry Portnoy on harp, Calvin Jones on bass, and Willie Smith on drums. Each of these Muddy alumni takes a vocal turn (Margolin takes two). While none of them matches the majesty of Muddy's voice, they certainly have the spirit of the thing down pat. A welcome note of variety is provided by the guest vocalists from the blues and rock world, who also stay very close to the Muddy Waters originals they cover: Greg Allman on &quot;Trouble No More,&quot; Buddy Guy on &quot;Clouds in My Heart,&quot; Levon Helm on &quot;Going to Main Street,&quot; James Cotton (another ex-Muddy bandmate) on &quot;Blow Wind Blow,&quot; Koko Taylor on &quot;Mean Mistreater,&quot; and Peter Wolf on &quot;Walking Through the Park&quot;.
