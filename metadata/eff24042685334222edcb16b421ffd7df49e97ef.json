It can also be used as self-learning material.\n\nEach chapter contains theoretical parts and programming examples. At the end of each chapter there is a bunch of exercises for your practice. At the end of the book you will find solutions to the exercises.\n\nThe purpose of the book is primarily to teach how to Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½think programmingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and secondarily to teach C++ code. Therefore, I will emphasize how to focus on the problem solution and prepare the coding.\n\n\n\n\nISBN: 978-87-403-0099-4\n1 edition\nPages : 246\nPrice: Free","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff24042685334222edcb16b421ffd7df49e97ef","amp;dn":"structured-programming-with-c-plus-plus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff24042685334222edcb16b421ffd7df49e97ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,242,64,66,104,83,52,34,46,220,177,107,66,31,253,125,244,158,151,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
