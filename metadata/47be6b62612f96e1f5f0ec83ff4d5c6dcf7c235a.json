Additionally, you'll learn patterns, chord movements, fill-ins, muting, rhythm, and a host of other techniques.\n\nWhile this is a beginners course and will introduce you to the basics and fundamentals, it also covers a lot of ground by revealing how to play full praise songs by the end. You'll be playing hand-clapping, foot-stomping songs like &quot;Bless That Wonderful Name Of Jesus,&quot; &quot;This Little Light Of Mine,&quot; &quot;Glory Glory, Hallelujah,&quot; and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47be6b62612f96e1f5f0ec83ff4d5c6dcf7c235a","amp;dn":"Hear+and+Play+Gospel+Guitar+101+-+Guitar+Lessons+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47be6b62612f96e1f5f0ec83ff4d5c6dcf7c235a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,190,107,98,97,47,150,225,245,240,236,131,255,77,92,109,207,124,35,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
