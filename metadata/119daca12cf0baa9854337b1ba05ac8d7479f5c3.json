This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nLeslie Pearl has her first ever top 40 debut with &quot;If The Love Fits, Wear It&quot; (at number 36). Casey says we have all heard her voice for years singing commercials for cars and soft drinks.\n\nCasey gives a special report on how TV soap operas have been using recording artists to boost their ratings. Looking back from 2014 we can see it didn't work, but since I saw a soap once where a woman fell of a building on a Monday and didn't hit the ground till Friday, I can see why the idea took so long to fail. \n\n&quot;Crimson And Clover&quot; (at number 29) by Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts is a remake of a former number one hit. The original was by Tommy James &amp; the Shondells and Casey plays some of the original.\n\nThe group Kansas has their song &quot;Play The Game Tonight&quot; at number 17. Casey says ten years earlier they were paying their road crew more than they were making themselves, and the roadies were making only $1.50 a day!\n\nCasey plays an extra by Aretha Franklin, the only recording act in the history of the Grammys to win in the same category eight years in a row. If she were my next door neighbor, I'd be over at her house all the time.\n\nThe biggest mover in the countdown is &quot;Hold Me&quot; by Fleetwood Mac. It leaps 10 big notches from number 22 to number 12.\n\nCasey tells a story about Paul McCartney (who is at number 8 with Stevie Wonder singing &quot;Ebony And Ivory&quot;) and how one time he spent $200 to give his neglected chickens a taxicab ride so they wouldn't get an inferiority complex. Well maybe he shouldn't have named that one band &quot;Wings&quot; then, huh? Anyway, Casey tells the story.\n\nLW#3: Ebony And Ivory - Paul McCartney &amp; Stevie Wonder\nLW#2: Rosanna - Toto\nLW#1: Don't You Want Me - Human League\n40:    Angel In Blue - J.
