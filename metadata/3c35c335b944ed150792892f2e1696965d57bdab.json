Jermaine got a badly needed shot in the arm from Stevie Wonder, who wrote and produced &quot;Let's Get Serious,&quot; a Top Ten pop and soul dance hit that came around the time of brother Michael's pop ascendancy. After scoring a Top 20 pop hit in 1982 with the infectious &quot;Let Me Tickle Your Fancy,&quot; Jermaine left Motown in 1983 for Arista Records, where he scored a pair of hits in 1984 with &quot;Do What You Do&quot; and the scintillating dance number &quot;Dynamite.&quot; Subsequently, he re-joined the Jacksons in time for their ill-fated Victory tour in 1984. Jackson has recorded sporadically since, though he generated controversy in 1991 when &quot;Word to the Badd,&quot; a thinly veiled attack on his brother Michael, was leaked out to urban music stations. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.88% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tSony\nCatalog:\t\t88697605532\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Dynamite\n02.Do What You Do\n03.When The Rain Begins To Fall (Duet With Pia Zadora)\n04.(Closest Thing To) Perfect\n05.I Think It's Love\n06.Do You Remember Me\n07.Words Into Action\n08.Sweetest Sweetest\n09.Don't Take It Personal\n10.Precious Moments\n11.Voices In The Dark\n12.Make It Easy On Love (Duet With Miki Howard)\n13.Give A Little Love\n14.Two Ships (In The Night)\n15.You Said, You Said\n16.True Lovers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c35c335b944ed150792892f2e1696965d57bdab","amp;dn":"Jermaine+Jackson+-+Greatest+Hits+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c35c335b944ed150792892f2e1696965d57bdab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,53,195,53,185,68,237,21,7,146,137,47,46,22,150,150,93,87,189,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
