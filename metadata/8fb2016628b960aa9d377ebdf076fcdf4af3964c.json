All of its members currently play in various other groups and solo projects, mainly based around the city of Toronto. The band refuses the label &quot;supergroup,&quot; based on size or the ubiquity of their members, claiming that in the indie scene everyone is involved in more than one project. The group's sound could be considered a combination of all of its members' respective musical projects, and is occasionally considered baroque pop. It is characterized by a very large number of sounds, grand orchestrations featuring guitars, horns, woodwinds, and violins, unusual song structures, and an experimental, and sometimes chaotic production style from David Newfeld, who produced the second and third albums.\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - New Instructions\n02 - Sudden Foot Loss\n03 - Shabba Lights\n04 - Song For Dee\n05 - ElingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Haus\n06 - Professor Sambo\n07 - Never Felt Alive\n08 - Paperweight Room\n09 - Turbo Mouse\n10 - Far Out\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; KEEP SEEDING ONCE YOU'RE FINISHED DOWNLOADING!!\nTHANKS!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fb2016628b960aa9d377ebdf076fcdf4af3964c","amp;dn":"Broken+Social+Scene+-+Lo-Fi+For+The+Dividing+Nights+EP+%282010%29%28EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fb2016628b960aa9d377ebdf076fcdf4af3964c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,178,1,102,40,185,96,170,157,55,126,189,240,118,252,223,74,243,150,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
