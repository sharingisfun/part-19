For example, people can identify the basic elements of Rock music, Jazz, or Blues, but what is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Hip-Hop remains a mystery to most. For the most part, anything young and urban is considered Hip-Hop by the mainstream, regardless of whether it is actually a part of the culture. Those of us who do know and care about it usually donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the same opportunity to shed light on the culture as those who have gotten rich keeping it shrouded in darkness. \n\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so reassuring that the Temple of Hip-Hop exists. Though the use of the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtempleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ implies religious affiliation, it certainly is not some kind of cult. The Temple of Hip-Hop is simply and organization dedicated to preserving and promoting Hip-Hop culture. The Temple is also the only Hip-Hop organization backed by originator Kool DJ Herc, and pioneers Afrika Bambaataa, Grand Master Flash, and founder KRS-ONE. As a result, it is quite simply THE authority on all things Hip-Hop. \n\nIn keeping with the goals of educating the masses about Hip-Hop, KRS has taken selections from his lectures at college campuses and Temple locations about the culture and compiled them into one CD called The Fondamentals of Hip-Hop. With this collection of selected lectures, he teaches about what Hip-Hop is and is not, working to hopefully remove the confusion surrounding this continually evolving culture. \n\nTracklisting \n1.
