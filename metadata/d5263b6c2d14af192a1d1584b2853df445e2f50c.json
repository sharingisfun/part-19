It teaches Clojure from the basics to advanced topics using practical, real-world application examples. Blow through the theory and dive into practical matters like unit-testing and environment set-up, all the way through building a scalable web-application using domain-specific languages, Hadoop, HBase, and RabbitMQ.\n\nClojure is a modern Lisp for the JVM, and it has the strengths youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d expect: first-class functions, macros, support for functional programming, and a Lisp-like, clean programming style.\n\nClojure in Action is a practical guide focused on applying Clojure to practical programming challenges. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll start with a language tutorial written for readers who already know OOP. Then, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll dive into the use cases where Clojure really shines: state management, safe concurrency and multicore programming, first-class code generation, and Java interop. In each chapter, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll first explore the unique characteristics of a problem area and then discover how to tackle them using Clojure. Along the way, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll explore practical matters like architecture, unit testing, and set-up as you build a scalable web application that includes custom DSLs, Hadoop, HBase, and RabbitMQ.\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Inside\n\nA fast-paced Clojure tutorial\nCreating web services with Clojure\nScaling through messaging\nCreating DSLs with ClojureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s macro system\nTest-driven development with Clojure\nDistributed programming with Clojure, and more\nThis book assumes youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re familiar with an OO language like Java, C#, or C++ but requires no background in Lisp or Clojure itself.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart 1: Getting started\nChapter 1.
