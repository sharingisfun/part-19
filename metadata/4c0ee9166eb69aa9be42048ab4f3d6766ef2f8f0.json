Battling against tyranny, ignorance, and superstition, it formulated the ideals of thought, religion, and expression, the value of science, and the pursuit of progress. Enlightenment thinkers undermined the ancien regime and provided the ideas for the French Revolution. Modern scholarship, however, has shown it was a more complex and ambiguous movement than commonly recognized. This book, now in a fully updated second edition, sympathetically explores the complexities of the Enlightenment. Synthesizing and evaluating the latest scholarship, it offers a new and comprehensive vision of this many-faceted movement.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c0ee9166eb69aa9be42048ab4f3d6766ef2f8f0","amp;dn":"Enlightenment+-+Roy+Porter.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c0ee9166eb69aa9be42048ab4f3d6766ef2f8f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,14,233,22,110,182,154,169,190,66,4,138,180,243,214,118,110,242,248,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
