Working alongside her producer David Cole, Melissa's songs celebrate a spiritual time of year where people can rejoice in their traditional, or non-traditional ways, and celebrate a winter solstice filled with love and peace. This ten song album has newly composed songs such as &quot;Ring The Bells,&quot; &quot;Light A Light,&quot; and &quot;It's Christmas Time&quot; interspersed with traditional holiday standards such as &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot; and &quot;Blue Christmas.&quot; This album begs the question, &quot;If we're all talking about peace on earth, what if we all concentrated on peace on earth and made it happen?&quot; \n\nAllmusic Review:\nMelissa Etheridge's Christmas album -- released in 2008, reissued in deluxe form the following year -- is faithful to her blues-rock beginnings while retaining a pleasant, relaxed, seasonal vibe. To Etheridge's credit, she devotes a considerable chunk of the record to originals, mostly slower, meditative pieces, but she kicks up the tempo on &quot;It's Christmas Time,&quot; which stands alongside the bluesy shuffle of &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot; and &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; as the liveliest stuff here. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fbfe3b3b385b5b795037ee5a12271245e7126af","amp;dn":"Melissa+Etheridge+-+A+New+Thought+for+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fbfe3b3b385b5b795037ee5a12271245e7126af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,191,227,179,179,133,181,183,149,3,126,229,161,34,113,36,94,113,38,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
