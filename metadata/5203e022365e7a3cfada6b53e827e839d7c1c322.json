This intriguing documentary series explores the ambitious effort to compile, transcribe, edit and present the papers of, by, and directly related to the LDS Prophet Joseph Smith.  In this series, Larry H. Miller and KJZZ Television have partnered with the Church History Department and a variety of prominent scholars to discuss the project, the documents, and the life and work of Joseph Smith.  \n\nThese video files were ripped from the 7-disc DVD set.  The discs contained no additional bonus features nor subtitles, or I would have included them as well.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t\tNOTES\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Joseph Smith Papers Project itself:\n\nThe Joseph Smith Papers (or Joseph Smith Papers Project) is a a project \nresearching, collecting, and publishing all manuscripts and documents created by or sent to Joseph Smith, Jr.(1805-1844), the founder and first prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).\n\nThey will present the earliest handwritten and published texts of the \nfoundational documents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including Joseph SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revelations and translations. The Papers will provide insights into JosephÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life and times through his correspondence, journals, discourses, court cases, and business dealings. In addition, the Papers will contain minutes of important church councils, reproductions of the scriptural canon as it existed during Joseph SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lifetime, official histories, and records pertaining to church institutions that were under Joseph SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \ndirection or that reflect his personal instruction and involvement.\n\nWith the PapersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ publication, readers will have, for the first time in one place, access to these essential primary documents. To date, there never has been a complete listing, let alone a comprehensive edition, of Joseph Smith's papers. This ambitious project is intended to fill that gap. \n\nAlthough not an official part of the project, a documentary TV series also called The Joseph Smith Papers was created. This series documented the creation of and work involved in the Joseph Smith Papers Project. It was produced by KJZZ-TV in cooperation with the LDS Church Historical Department.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5203e022365e7a3cfada6b53e827e839d7c1c322","amp;dn":"Joseph+Smith+Papers+-+Complete+Season+1+-+Mormon+LDS+Book+of+Mor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5203e022365e7a3cfada6b53e827e839d7c1c322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,3,224,34,54,94,122,60,250,218,107,83,232,39,232,57,215,193,195,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
