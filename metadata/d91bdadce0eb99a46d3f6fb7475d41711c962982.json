As Senior VP of Apple, Jay served as Steve's right-hand man and trouble-shooter, overseeing all corporate operations and business planning, as well as software development and HR. In Leading Apple with Steve Jobs, Jay details how Steve managed and motivated his peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€and what every manager can learn from Jobs about motivating people to do the best work of their lives.\nSteve Jobs used the phrase &quot;Pirates! Not the Navy&quot; as a rallying cryÃ¢â‚¬â€a metaphor to &quot;Think Different.&quot; In the days of developing the Macintosh, it became a four-word mission statement. It expresses the heart of Apple and Steve. The management principles that grew out of that statement form the backbone of this book.
