Kurtzman, \ncreator of Mad magazine and godfather of underground \ncomix, teamed with longtime E.C. Comics collaborator \nWill Elder (and sometimes Frank Frazetta, Russ Heath, \nand Jack Davis!) to create a Playboy icon second \nonly to the bunny and a risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© comics icon second \nto none! Each volume showcases over 200 pages of \nstunningly rendered stories from the sexy strip's \n25-year run. Trend setting in its use of color, \nirreverent in its satirical look at the changing \nface of America, and a masterpiece of technique, \nthis definitive collection of one of world's most \ncontroversial comic strips is long overdue. \n\n\nThe first volume takes us through the swinging \nSixties with the Beatles, Civil Rights, and the \nbeginning of the Sexual Revolution. Also included, \na detailed behind-the-scenes look at the strip's \ncreative process, featuring never-before-seen \nart and preliminary drawings!\n\n\nDark Horse concludes its complete reprinting of \nPlayboy's legendary Little Annie Fanny strip, \nwith an even bigger second volume. Picking \nup where the first volume left off, this collection \nfollows the strip through to its end in 1988. \nRalph Nader, the women's movement, Star Wars, \nand Arnold Schwarzenegger all fall victim to \nthe merciless and masterful satire of Kurtzman \nand Elder. The first volume was a smash hit, and the \nsecond includes all the same goodies, with \nnever-before-seen production art and behind-the-\nscenes info about Hefner, Kurtzman, Elder, and the \nhost of cartoonists who contributed to this \nrevolutionary comic.\n\n\n\nComic Book Readers:\n\nWindows:  CDisplay, CDisplayEX, MangaMeeya, ComicRack, Comical\nWindows Mobile:  Comic Reader Mobile\nMac:  FFView, Jomic, KComic, Pyzam, Comical\niPhone/iPod:  ComicZeal\nLinux:  Comix, Comical\n\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to all Scanners &amp; Uploaders!\n\n\nBrought to you by SBM..\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5922b1a42c7cd3e8b0904447d2d2ad7f04c4a2cc","amp;dn":"Playboy%5C%27s+Little+Annie+Fanny+-+Vol.+1+%26+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5922b1a42c7cd3e8b0904447d2d2ad7f04c4a2cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,34,177,164,44,124,211,232,176,144,68,71,210,210,173,127,4,196,162,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
