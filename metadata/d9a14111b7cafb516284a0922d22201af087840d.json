Includes 14 tracks of mega-awesome, retro-70's, blues-based, Hendrix-inspired, killer power trio riffage that kicks serious heavy guitar ass. Highly recommended to fans of JIMI HENDRIX, SRV, INDIGENOUS, ROBIN TROWER &amp; TOMMY BOLIN.\nThe Gugun Power Trio's premier release, &quot;Far East Blues Experience,&quot; rocks from start to finish. It's a CD that virtually defines heavy, groove-laiden blues-rock, with its focus squarely on blues guitar virtuosity. The CD is comprised of all original material, but the band does not neglect their prestigious predecessors -- one can hear obvious influences from Robin Trower, Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Although long famous in Indonesia, their time has finally come: Sounds like this, blending Far East sensibility with good old fashioned blues guitar nectar, deserve to be heard worldwide. What we have here is a dynamic, virtuosic wall of sound, replete with a refined sense of melody, sophisticated chordal arrangements, and kick-em-in-the-face rock-n-roll.\n\nTracks:\n------\n01. Woman\n02. Turn It On\n03. Fallin' Down\n04. Who Is To Blame\n05. Spinnin' Around Me\n06. Holding On\n07. Move On\n08. Talk Too Much\n09. Plastic People\n10. Night Flying\n11. Emptiness\n12.
