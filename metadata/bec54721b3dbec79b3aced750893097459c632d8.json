It does not hide bad sectors, it really restores them! Hard disk \ndrive is an integral part of every computer. It stores all your information. \nOne of the most prevalent defects of hard drives is bad sectors on the disk \nsurface. Bad sectors are a part of the disk surface which contains not readable, \nbut frequently necessary information. As a result of bad sectors you may have \ndifficulties to read and copy data from your disk, your operating system becomes \nunstable and finally your computer may unable to boot altogether. When a hard \ndrive is damaged with bad sectors, the disk not only becomes unfit for use, but \nalso you risk losing information stored on it. The HDD Regenerator can repair \ndamaged hard disks without affecting or changing existing data. As a result, \npreviously unreadable and inaccessible information is restored.\n\n\nMain benefits\nHard disk drive is an integral part of every computer. It stores all your \ninformation. One of the most prevalent defects of hard drives is bad sectors on \nthe disk surface. Bad sectors are a part of the disk surface which contains not \nreadable, but frequently necessary information. As a result of bad sectors you \nmay have difficulties to read and copy data from your disk, your operating system \nbecomes unstable and finally your computer may unable to boot altogether. When a \nhard drive is damaged with bad sectors, the disk not only becomes unfit for use, \nbut also you risk losing information stored on it. The HDD Regenerator can repair \ndamaged hard disks without affecting or changing existing data. As a result, \npreviously unreadable and inaccessible information is restored.  \n\nHow it works\nAlmost 60% of all hard drives damaged with bad sectors have an incorrectly \nmagnetized disk surface. We have developed an algorithm which is used to repair \ndamaged disk surfaces. This technology is hardware independent, it supports many \ntypes of hard drives and repairs damage that even low-level disk formatting cannot\nrepair. As a result, previously unreadable information will be restored. Because \nof the way the repair is made, the existing information on the disk drive will not \nbe affected!\n\nCan the HDD Regenerator repair your drive?\nAlmost 60 % of damaged hard disks can be repaired by regeneration. You can always \ndownload free demo version and try to regenerate the first found bad sector. \nThe main purpose of the unregistered demo version is to display a report which \ncontains information about the possibility to regenerate the entire disk by means \nof the registered full version. If the first found bad sector has been \nsuccessfully regenerated, you can buy the product to regenerate all bad sectors \non your hard drive. If the first bad sector has NOT been successfully regenerated,\nthen replace your hard disk drive as soon as possible.\n\nImportant notes\nSince the program does not change the logical structure of a hard drive, the \nfile system may still show some sectors marked earlier as 'bad', and other disk \nutilities such as Scandisk will detect logical bad sectors even though the disk \nhas been successfully regenerated and is no longer damaged by physical bad \nsectors. If you want to remove these marks, repartition the hard disk drive.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Ability to detect physical bad sectors on a hard disk drive surface.\n* Ability to repair physical bad sectors(magnetic errors) on a hard disk surface.\n* The product ignores file system, scans disk at physical level. It can be used \n  with FAT,NTFS or any other file system, and also with unformatted or \n  unpartitioned disks.\n* Starting process directly under Windows XP / Vista.\n* Bootable regenerating flash can be created from the program and used to \n  automatically start regenerating process.\n* Bootable regenerating CD allows starting regenerating process under \n  DOS automatically. \n\n\n\nOS: Windows All \n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.abstradrome.com/contact.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.abstradrome.com/contact.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dposoft.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dposoft.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of \n    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at may 14 2009 - 22.00 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec54721b3dbec79b3aced750893097459c632d8","amp;dn":"HDD+Regenerator+1.71+%2B+Keymaker+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec54721b3dbec79b3aced750893097459c632d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,197,71,33,179,219,236,121,179,172,237,117,8,147,9,116,89,198,50,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
