(2001 - Netherlands)\r\n\r\nComedy / Drama\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255637/\r\n\r\n\r\nMelbourne Underground Film Festival - WON - Best Gratuitous Use of Sex\r\n\r\nTerrorama! is the first feature film of Dutch director Edwin Brienen. In 2002 the film won the award for best film at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival and best leading actress at the Toronto Independent Film Festival.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of six mental cases, trying to get rid of society's norms and values by kidnapping Gerard van Dongen, a well-known TV host. During an improvised TV show, the terrorists confront this Van Dongen with their darkest thoughts and emotions, resulting in violent excesses and extreme sexual behaviour.\r\n\r\nTerrorama!, as an aberrant arthouse piece, is ironically a work of aesthetic terrorism itself, not only in its obscene and ominous objective to visually and audibly offend, but also to &quot;philosophically enlighten&quot; the viewer. Terrorama! - for better or for worse - makes the films of Pier Paolo Pasolini and Herbert Achternbusch seem overly sentimental and subdued by comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x352, 25.000 fps, 1387 Kbps, 01h41m49s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 138 kbps\r\nRatio: 16:9\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Dutch audio, English subtitles hardcoded\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/jcvri4fwx/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/5ullqee1t/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/8d7ar2zs1/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/qhabbpxgh/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/58wmuaizl/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:567eae7c4ed1a1492d3be052ff795e55082f8473","amp;dn":"Terrorama%21+%5B2001+-+Netherlands%5D+NL+sick+arthouse+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"567eae7c4ed1a1492d3be052ff795e55082f8473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,126,174,124,78,209,161,73,45,59,224,82,255,121,94,85,8,47,132,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
