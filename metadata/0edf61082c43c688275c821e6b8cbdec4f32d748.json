All four of the amazing authors mentioned above had already established themselves as premier writers in the industry, and the level of overlapping detail and wonderful individual stories in this series just proved it further. With Final Crisis and especially Countdown elicit mixed reactions, this series remains a high-water mark for DC and is worth reading for sure.
