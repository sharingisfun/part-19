Most of the vids are 1-2min cuts, but In The Flesh 2 and The Trial are almost full length and very nice IMO. The sound is kind of bassy, but I donÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t have software to correct it and IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´m not very skilled in that stuff. Pictures are... well, mobile phone pictures . I was in the fifth row in the middle.\n \nRecorded with Samsung Galaxy S default video recorder; 720p (except In The Flesh, which isnÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t HD).\n \nIt contains:\n \n1. Another Brick in The Wall\n 2. Comfortably Numb\n 3. In The Flesh\n 4. In The Flesh 2\n 5. Outside The Wall\n 6. The Trial\n 7. The Trial (tearing down the Wall)\n 8. Vera + Bring the Boys Back Home\n 9. What Shall We Do Now\n \nIf anyone would like to improve some of the videos or use it elsewhere, feel free (but informing me would be nice .\n\nAndy517","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c285f574a3559570564cd84b5816560e7daa7c05","amp;dn":"Roger+Waters+-+The+Wall+live+%40+Praha+2011-04-15+-+HD+vids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c285f574a3559570564cd84b5816560e7daa7c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,133,245,116,163,85,149,112,86,76,216,75,88,22,86,14,125,170,124,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
