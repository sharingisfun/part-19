This makes it much easier to find the issues you are interested in, and for the researchers it will drastically reduce the amount of time they need to spend to find some information on the issues they are researching.\n\nThis collection contains both, English and Russian language versions. Some of the best books are only available in Russian while others are only in English. Even if you do not know the language, you still might want to read these books via some translation service such as translate.google.com. Even though translation is not perfect, but still, information is so valuable that you will be able to see the most essential part of it. In particular, the works of Gregory Klimov in Russian, that were never published in English because to total censorship, are worth a read via translation service.\n\nSome books are also available in audio format.
