He was inspired by the activities of Richard Cobden and the organization of the Anti-Corn Law League in Britain in the 1840s and tried to mimic their success in France. Bastiat was an elected member of various French political bodies and opposed both protection and the rise of socialist ideas in these forums. His writings for a broader audience were very popular and were quickly translated and republished in the U.S. and throughout Europe. His incomplete magnum opus, Economic Harmonies, is full of insights into the operation of the market and is still of great interest to economists. He died at a young age from cancer of the throat.\n\n\nEconomic Harmonies\nAn English translation of BastiatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest and best known work Economic Harmonies.\n\nEconomic Sophisms\nAn English translation of BastiatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s series of short essays in which he tries to correct common misunderstandings about the free market.\n\nThe Law\nAn English translation of one of BastiatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous pamphlets, written as part of his opposition to the growth of socialism in France in the 1840s and where he states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the state is the great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone elseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nSelected Essays on Political Economy\nAn English translation of some of BastiatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous pamphlets, written as part of his opposition to the growth of socialism in France in the 1840s.
