During this period, the cell does not appear to be infected, but it is.\n\nPlayers take part in a cross-faction secret network dubbed Firewall that is dedicated to counteracting &quot;existential risks&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ threats to the existence of transhumanity, whether they be biowar plagues, self-replicating nanoswarms, nuclear proliferation, terrorists with WMDs, net-breaking computer attacks, rogue AIs, alien encounters, or anything else that could drive an already decimated transhumanity to extinction.&quot;\n\n&quot;The Eclipse Phase roleplaying game was released under a Creative Commons license; the text found on the Eclipse Phase website is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License.
