It was originally formed in the autumn of 1972 (making its live debut at Frankfurt's Zoom Club in November) with the following line-up:\n\nDave Greenslade - keyboards and vocals (born 18 January 1943, Woking, Surrey) \nTony Reeves - bass guitar (born Anthony Reeves, 18 April 1943, Lee Green, South East London) \nDave Lawson - keyboards and vocals (born David Lawson, 25 April 1945, Hampshire) \nAndrew McCulloch - drums (born 19 November 1945, Bournemouth, Dorset) \nLongtime musical associates, with a common background in jazz, Greenslade and Reeves had been original members of Colosseum. Lawson was previously a member of the Alan Bown Set, Web and Samurai, whilst McCulloch was briefly a member of King Crimson, playing drums on that band's third album, Lizard (1970), and Fields, the band formed by ex-Rare Bird keyboardist Graham Field.\n\nDave Clempson (ex Humble Pie) guested on Greenslade's third album, playing guitar on two tracks. Reeves left around that time and was replaced on the U.S. tour and subsequent fourth album, Time And Tide, by Martin Briley who also contributed on guitar.\n\nGreenslade announced their disbandment in early 1976. Dave Greenslade went on to record his debut solo album, Cactus Choir, and in late 1976 and early 1977 put together a new band line-up with ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band frontman Mick Rogers. Initially the rhythm section consisted of Dave Markee and Simon Phillips, who had played on the album, but they were replaced by Tony Reeves (who had in the meantime joined the final line-up of Curved Air) and Jon Hiseman (then concurrently leading his own Colosseum II) for the 1977 dates.\n\nIn 2000, Greenslade and Reeves, after considering a full-blown reunion of the original line-up, teamed up with drummer John Trotter and vocalist/keyboardist John Young, and recorded a new Greenslade studio album: Large Afternoon. A tour followed, and this was recorded, and subsequently released in 2002, as Greenslade 2001 - Live: The Full Edition.\n\nGreenslade is an eponymous album of seven songs from the British progressive rock band Greenslade, released in 1972, and their first studio album. The artwork for the album cover is by Roger Dean.\n\n&quot;Feathered Friends&quot; (music: Dave Greenslade, lyrics: Dave Lawson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:47 \n&quot;An English Western&quot; (Greenslade) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 \n&quot;Drowning Man&quot; (Greenslade) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:50 \n&quot;Temple Song&quot; (music: Greenslade, lyrics: Lawson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 \n&quot;MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lange&quot; (Tony Reeves, Greenslade, Lawson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:30 \n&quot;What Are You Doin' To Me?&quot; (Lawson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44 \n&quot;Sundance&quot; (Greenslade) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:44 \n\nAudio CD (1 Jan 1996) \nNumber of Discs: 1 \nLabel: WEA \nASIN: B0000087M2\n\nPersonnel\nAndrew McCulloch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums, percussion \nDave Lawson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ keyboards, vocals \nTony Reeves ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar, double bass, co-producer \nDave Greenslade ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ keyboards, co-producer \nStuart Taylor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ co-producer \nMike Bobak ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ engineer \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27c5a4dca0cc330e555407c42fcf7447255dd98d","amp;dn":"Greenslade...Greenslade%281972%29cd%281996%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27c5a4dca0cc330e555407c42fcf7447255dd98d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,197,164,220,160,204,51,14,85,84,7,196,47,207,116,71,37,93,217,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
