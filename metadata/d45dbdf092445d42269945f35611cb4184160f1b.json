At the center of everything is the 77th Earl, Titus Groan, who stands to inherit the miles of rambling stone &amp; mortar that form Gormenghast Castle and it's kingdom.\n\n&quot;In these extraordinary novels, Peake has created a world where all is like a dream--lush, fantaastical, vivid; a symbol of dark struggle. Accompanying the text are his own drawings, illustrating the whole assembly of strange yet very real creatures that inhabit Gormenghast.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n-Ventricle\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d45dbdf092445d42269945f35611cb4184160f1b","amp;dn":"The+Gormenghast+Trilogy+by+Mervyn+Peake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d45dbdf092445d42269945f35611cb4184160f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,93,189,240,146,68,93,66,38,153,69,243,86,17,203,65,132,22,15,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
