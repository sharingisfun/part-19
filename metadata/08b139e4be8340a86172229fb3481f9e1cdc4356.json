In a story reminiscent of the Asterix books, Dan Hancox explores the reality behind the community where no one has a mortgage, sport is played in the Che Guevara stadium and there are monthly Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red SundaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where everyone works together to clean up the neighbourhood. In particular he tells the story of the village mayor, SÃƒÂ¡nchez Gordillo, who in 2012 became a household name in Spain after leading raids on local supermarkets to feed the Andalucian unemployed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b139e4be8340a86172229fb3481f9e1cdc4356","amp;dn":"The+Village+Against+The+World+-+Dan+Hancox.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b139e4be8340a86172229fb3481f9e1cdc4356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,177,57,228,190,131,64,168,97,114,34,159,179,72,31,158,28,220,67,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
