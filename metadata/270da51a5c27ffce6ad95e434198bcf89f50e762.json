The band was originally named Huang Chung, name which means &quot;yellow bell&quot; in Mandarin Chinese, and is the first note in the Chinese classical music scale. When the band signed with Geffen, they were convinced to simply the spelling to &quot;Wang Chung.&quot;\n\nThe band spent most of 1983 recording their second album, Points on the Curve. Released in January 1984, the album yielded two moderately successful hits, &quot;Don't Let Go&quot; (No. 38 US) and &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot; (No. 16 US, No. 21 UK).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:270da51a5c27ffce6ad95e434198bcf89f50e762","amp;dn":"Wang+Chung+-+Points+On+The+Curve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"270da51a5c27ffce6ad95e434198bcf89f50e762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,13,165,26,92,39,255,206,106,217,94,67,65,152,188,248,159,80,231,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
