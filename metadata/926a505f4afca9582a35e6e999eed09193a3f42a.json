Split evenly between solo material and songs recorded with wife June Carter and the Carter family, Country Christmas runs the gamut from reverent (&quot;What Child Is This?&quot;) to downright knee-slappin' (the grin inducing &quot;Piggy Puddin'&quot;). About the only thing the 15-song set doesn't have is a veneer of slickness to rope in the stuffed shirts. And who needs them at a Christmas party, anyway?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:926a505f4afca9582a35e6e999eed09193a3f42a","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+Country+Christmas+%5BBonus+Tracks%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"926a505f4afca9582a35e6e999eed09193a3f42a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,106,80,95,74,252,169,88,42,53,230,233,153,238,208,145,147,163,244,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
