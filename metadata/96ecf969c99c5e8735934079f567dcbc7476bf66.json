The twenty-eight-year-old piano prodigy has never had a regular boyfriend, much less a real romance. Her music career has left little room for friends or family--which is just part of the reason she hasn't seen the family bakery or her two sisters in years.But now Nicole is sick, and Jesse is AWOL. Despite the fact that Claire can't boil water, she's determined to play caretaker. Connecting with her sisters tops her to-do list...along with falling in love, or at least in lust, for the first time.\n\nRuggedly sexy Wyatt just might fit the bill. Although he keeps saying that he and Claire come from entirely different worlds, he lights up hotter than a bakery oven whenever Claire is near. If this keeps up, she just might sweet--talk him into her bed...and her life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96ecf969c99c5e8735934079f567dcbc7476bf66","amp;dn":"Susan+Mallery+-Sweet+Talk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96ecf969c99c5e8735934079f567dcbc7476bf66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,236,249,105,201,156,94,135,53,147,64,121,245,103,220,188,116,118,191,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
