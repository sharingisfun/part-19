Topics covered include microwave instrumentation, such as network analyzers, real-time spectrum analyzers and microwave synthesizers; linear measurements, such as VNA calibrations, noise figure measurements, time domain reflectometry and multiport measurements; and non-linear measurements, such as load- and source-pull techniques, broadband signal measurements, and non-linear NVAs. Each technique is discussed in detail and accompanied by state-of-the-art solutions to the unique technical challenges associated with its use. With each chapter written by internationally recognised experts in the field, this is an invaluable resource for researchers and professionals involved with microwave measurements.\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nValeria Teppati is a Researcher in the Millimeter Wave Electronics Group of the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at ETH Zurich, developing innovative solutions to aspects of linear and non-linear measurement techniques.\n\nAndrea Ferrero is a Professor in the RF, Microwave and Computational Electronics group of the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications at Politecnico di Torino. He is a Distinguished Microwave Lecturer of the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society, and a Fellow of the IEEE.\n\nMohamed Sayed is the Principal Consultant for Microwave and Millimeter Wave Solutions and has nearly 30 years' experience of developing microwave and millimetre wave systems for Hewlett-Packard Co. and Agilent Technologies Inc.\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f94ae367ea8abac95b71a27a365eb945042aee40","amp;dn":"Modern+RF+%26amp%3B+Microwave+Measurement+Techniques+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f94ae367ea8abac95b71a27a365eb945042aee40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,74,227,103,234,138,186,201,91,113,162,122,54,94,185,69,4,42,238,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
