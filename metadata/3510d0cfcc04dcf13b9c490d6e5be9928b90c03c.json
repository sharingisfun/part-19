With the help of a talking statue of a god, an outcast hyena, a shadow-being of undeterminate origin, and an oracular slug, she seeks to find out where she is and how to go about getting back to her warren.  With an irreverent sense of humor and a fantasy protagonist with a healthy dose of skepticism, &quot;Digger&quot; rapidly gained a huge following of devoted fans.  The comic has won multiple Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards, and in 2012, received the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story.\n\nThis torrent collects the entire run of &quot;Digger,&quot; from 2007 through 2011, in a set of CBR files.  Those files correspond to the published volumes of the comic, but they are NOT scans of the books; all the comics in this torrent were downloaded directly from the diggercomic.com Web site","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3510d0cfcc04dcf13b9c490d6e5be9928b90c03c","amp;dn":"Digger+%28Web+Comic%29+-+Complete+Run%2C+2007-2011+%7BWebComixFan%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3510d0cfcc04dcf13b9c490d6e5be9928b90c03c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,16,208,207,204,4,220,241,59,156,73,13,110,91,233,146,139,144,192,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
