So \nplease have patience and as promised I will have them uploaded as soon as possible.....KloWn\n\n\nCASTLEVANIA: SYMPHONY OF THE NIGHT\n\nUnlike most previous Castlevania games, Symphony of the Night features a main character who isn't one of the whip-cracking Belmonts. Stranger still, it turns out that our hero, Adrian Fahrenheit (aka Alucard), is actually a son of Dracula. Your task is to explore Dracula's castle (rumored to only appear once a century) and find out why Richter Belmont, the hero of the first game (and descendant of the original Castlevania hero, Simon), has mysteriously vanished. Oh, and you've also got to kill quite a few monsters along the wayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b44deb17c771f3fb5bed5511562492adaa9e061","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Castlevania%3ASymphony+of+the+Night+converted+properly+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b44deb17c771f3fb5bed5511562492adaa9e061","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,68,222,177,124,119,31,63,181,190,213,81,21,98,73,42,218,169,224,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
