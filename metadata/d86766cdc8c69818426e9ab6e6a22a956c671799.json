Then I also thought it would be nice to make a movie-length edit of the remaining material.\n\nIntention:\n\nTo cut together all the non-interview material from the 6 episodes into one long narrative. I wanted to make the joins as seemless as possible without removing large parts of the show (As it's all comedy gold) but let's be honest, it's still fairly episodic. Which is why I called this edit Tales From The Hellmouth in a nod to similar anthology horror films\n\nI've presented this as if it was a lost 16mm film version of 'Darkplace'. Maybe Producer Dean Learner cut the TV episodes into a movie to show in one of his &quot;Gentleman's Cinemas&quot;, in an effort to squeeze a few more quid out his investment. To further this fun idea, I've added a cinema style introduction as if it was a low-rent 1980s British cinema release. Plus there are trailers, previews, adverts, an intermission and I've even created a little tribute to a certain infamous Peter Cushing Horror movie, which I call &quot;The Darkplace Break&quot;.\n\nOther Sources:\n\nGarth Marengi's Darkplace DVD\nMan To Man With Dean Learner DVD\nLook Around You DVD\nThe Peter Serafinowicz Show DVD\nThe Beast Must Die DVD\nKing Diamond - Let It Be Done\nVarious Public Domain soundFX and Video Clips\n\nEditing Details:\n\n- I wanted to preserve as much of the material as possible, while also trying to make this into one semi-seemless whole. So I've hopefully struck the right balance.\n- The material has been presented as a vintage Grindhouse movie, but not slavishly. So I've kept obviously televisual things like the superbly cheesy opening titles, monologues and establishing shots.\n\n\nCuts and Additions:\n\n\nGeneral Changes:\n- Added &quot;Film Damage&quot; throughout\n- Added crackles and other film soundFX at various points but used sparingly\n- Added film-grain\n- Added extra transition SoundFX and other moments\n- Added various trailers and clips\n- Removed all but one of the episode titles and Garth introductions\n- Removed all mock-interview footage\n- Removed or cropped-out all onscreen titles\n- Removed all advert-break intros and outros\n- Removed some but not all, of Dagless' voiceover prologues and epilogues.
