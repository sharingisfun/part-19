Near 104 minutes.\r\n\r\nDetails: \r\nThe recording is a very good balanced professional board tape.\r\n\r\n1. Rock and Roll\r\n2. Celebration Day\r\n3. Black Dog\r\n4. Over The Hills and Far Away\r\n5. Misty Mountain Hop\r\n6. Since I've Been Loving You\r\n7. No Quarter\r\n8. The Song Remains the Same\r\n9. The Rain Song\r\n10. Dazed and Confused\r\n11. Stairway to Heaven\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThis is all that exists from this show. A mixed performance rushed \r\nand tense for the most part as Jones is playing with fractured ribs! \r\n&quot;John Paul Jones has got two fractured ribs and he's still managing \r\nto stand. I think that's fantastic! That's not really fun at all ... \r\nwe thought he'd got the clap.&quot; The first three numbers are very \r\nrushed and sloppy and also Celebration Day is plugged with problems \r\nwith monitors but Since I've Been Loving You is outstanding and Dazed \r\nAnd Confused is rather loose but very exciting, energetic and bow solo \r\nis very dark","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aa2502c9b834a7a506c4527813213e2e8658779","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.05.18+Dallas%2C+Texas+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aa2502c9b834a7a506c4527813213e2e8658779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,162,80,44,155,131,74,122,80,108,69,39,129,50,19,226,232,101,135,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
