So, it is worth recalling the distinctions that existed at the times these entities performed and recorded. The Wailers, formed in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1963, was a vocal group consisting of Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, Bunny Livingston, Bob Marley, Peter McIntosh, and Cherry Smith; they were called variously the Teenagers, the Wailing Rudeboys, the Wailing Wailers, and finally the Wailers. Braithwaite, Kelso, and Smith had departed by 1966, leaving the trio of Livingston, Marley, and McIntosh. By the early '70s, they had begun playing musical instruments and added a rhythm section consisting of brothers Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett (bass) and Carlton (Carlie) Barrett (drums). After recording extensively in Jamaica, this unit was signed to Great Britain's Island Records, which issued its label debut, Catch a Fire, in April 1973, followed by Burnin' in November. These albums attracted critical attention but did not chart at first.\n\n\nGenre................: Reggae\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2005\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Stir It Up\n02.Slave Driver\n03.Concrete Jungle\n04.Get Up, Stand Up\n05.I Shot The Sheriff\n06.Burnin' And Lootin'\n07.Lively Up Yourself\n08.Rebel Music (3 O'Clock Roadblock)\n09.Trenchtown Rock (Live)\n10.No Woman, No Cry (Live)\n11.Jah Live\n12.Positive Vibration\n13.Roots, Rock, Reggae\n14.Crazy Baldhead\n15.Natural Mystic\n16.Exodus\n17.Jamming\n\nCD2\n\n01.One Love  People Get Ready\n02.Waiting In Vain\n03.Punky Reggae Party\n04.Is This Love\n05.Sun Is Shining\n06.Satisfy Your Soul\n07.Kinky Reggae (Live)\n08.WarNo More Trouble (Live)\n09.So Much Trouble In The World\n10.Africa Unite\n11.One Drop\n12.Could You Be Loved\n13.Coming In From The Cold\n14.Redemption Song\n15.Buffalo Soldier\n16.Rastaman Live Up!\n17.Iron Lion Zion\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers... \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c47a2a1c06d4359f1b271f5eb2dc598bf95413","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+%26amp%3B+The+Wailers+-+Gold+%282005%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c47a2a1c06d4359f1b271f5eb2dc598bf95413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,196,122,42,28,6,212,53,159,27,39,31,94,178,220,89,139,249,84,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
