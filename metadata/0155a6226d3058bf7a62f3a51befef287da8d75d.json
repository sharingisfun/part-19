Dreamer (Grosch, Mischke)\n\n&quot;Beautiful Day&quot; is the fourth album of the german duo Jazzamor (Bettina Mischke &amp; Roland Grosch). From their first album on they had their own sound - and they kept working on it and developing it. The music of Jazzamor contains elements of different styles - jazz, lounge and pop.\n\n&quot;Jazz: Yes or Not?&quot; is the question on their homepage. For their debut album &quot;Lazy Sunday Afternoon&quot; the answer could maybe have been &quot;yes&quot;. But for &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;?\nNo, not really. Jazzamor is easy listening in the best meaning of this word: catchy melodies, nice vocals and refreshing music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0155a6226d3058bf7a62f3a51befef287da8d75d","amp;dn":"Jazzamor+-+2008+-+Beautiful+Day","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0155a6226d3058bf7a62f3a51befef287da8d75d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,85,166,34,109,48,88,191,122,98,243,165,27,239,239,40,125,168,215,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
