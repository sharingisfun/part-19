Mount it or burn it then watch it but don't sleep thru it. It is all there with menus ect. This season they include the directors commentary and a few more cheesy bonus features or specials. Season 8 brings alternate language tracks and subtitles and more cheezy bonuses.. I'm trying every few days to upload another DVD.. So far so good. No I take that back, I'm dicken around again.. ;)\nAny problems kindly keep them to yourself or ask someone who can help.\n\nSpanish and French subs I believe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0942b5d39db6e49c71a94f3a3848e5a9d3c4a620","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG1+Season+8+Disk+5+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0942b5d39db6e49c71a94f3a3848e5a9d3c4a620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,66,181,211,157,182,228,156,113,169,79,58,56,72,229,169,211,196,166,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
