Its state-of-the-art cinematography creates an intimate sense of place and captures a world of wonder, transporting viewers to isolated, undisturbed corners of the globe so pure they remind us of how the ancient world once was.\n\n\n1) Denali - Alaska Great Wilderness \nThere is a place on Earth where an Alaskan wilderness spreads over more than six million acres like a living tapestry at the foot of the tallest peak in North America. Here, seasons of unfathomable extremes march beneath a mountain known as The Great One. In Denali&amp;#039;s fierce winter, 20 hours of darkness and temperatures dipping nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit below zero are routine; in summer, 20 hours of sunlight. Grizzly bear, wolf, moose, ground squirrel and golden eagle have each found their own way to live in this sub-Arctic eco-system where life pulses in a series of harsh, dark winters, framed by the light of June and August. In this land of extremes, plants and animals alike must be strong to survive. The place is an Eden called Denali.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: X264\nVideo Bitrate: 2050 KB/s\nAverage Quants:\n* I:16.50 to 17.50\n* P:17.50 to 18.50\n* B:19.00 to 20.00\n\nVideo Resolution 1 - 14: 640 x 464 (4:3)\nVideo Resolution 15 - 24: 688 x 368 (16:9)\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio BitRate: 128 KB/s\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:47\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 24\nPart Size: 744 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: DVB\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Related Documentaries \n* Planet Earth http://docuwiki.net/?title=Planet%20Earth\n* Greatest Places http://docuwiki.net/?title=Greatest%20Places\n* The Living Planet http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Living%20Planet\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Living_Edens\n\nwww mvgroup org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0f8c827a940dad5c3fa8cce63a916c6944b2292","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.The.Living.Edens.01of24.Denali.DVB.x264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0f8c827a940dad5c3fa8cce63a916c6944b2292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,248,200,39,169,64,218,213,195,250,140,206,99,169,22,198,148,75,34,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
