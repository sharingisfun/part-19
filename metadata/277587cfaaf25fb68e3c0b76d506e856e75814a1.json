Moore got his first good-quality guitar at the age of 14, learning to play the right-handed instrument in the standard way despite being left-handed. Moore\\'s early musical influences were artists such as Albert King, Elvis Presley and The Beatles. Later, having seen Jimi Hendrix and John Mayall\\'s Bluesbreakers in his home town of Belfast, his own style was developing into a blues-rock sound that would come to dominate his career.\n\nMoore\\'s greatest influence in the early days came from guitarist Peter Green, of Fleetwood Mac fame, who was a mentor to Moore when performing in Dublin. Green\\'s continued influence on Moore was later repaid as a tribute to Green on his 1995 album Blues for Greeny, an album consisting entirely of Green compositions. On this tribute album Moore played Green\\'s 1959 Les Paul Standard guitar which Green had lent to Moore after leaving Fleetwood Mac. Moore ultimately purchased the guitar, at Green\\'s request, so that \\&quot;it would have a good home\\&quot;.[4]\n\nWhile somewhat less popular in the US, Moore\\'s work has \\&quot;brought substantial acclaim and commercial success in most other parts of the world ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ especially in Europe\\&quot;.[5] Moore throughout his career has been recognised as an influence by many notable guitarists including Vivian Campbell, [6] Patrick Rondat,[7] Jake E. Lee,[8] John Norum, Joe Bonamassa, Adrian Smith, Randy Rhoads, John Sykes, Kirk Hammett,[9] Gus G.[10]\n\nMoore collaborated with a broad range of artists including George Harrison, Trilok Gurtu, Dr. Strangely Strange, Colosseum II, Albert Collins, Jimmy Nail, Mo Foster, Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, Jim Capaldi, Vicki Brown, Cozy Powell, the Beach Boys, Ozzy Osbourne and Andrew Lloyd Webber. He experimented with many musical genres, including rock, jazz, blues, country, electric blues, hard rock and heavy metal.[11]\n\n[edit] Skid RowIn 1969, aged 16, Moore moved to Dublin to join the group Skid Row with Noel Bridgeman and Brendan \\&quot;Brush\\&quot; Shiels. It was with this group that Moore earned a reputation in the music industry, and his association with Phil Lynott began.[2]\n\n[edit] AlbumsSkid (1970)\n34 Hours (1971)\nGary Moore/Brush Shiels/Noel Bridgeman (1971) Released (1990)\nLive And On Song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ BBC Live in Concert (1969ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“71) Released (2006)\n[edit] Solo careerMoore released his first solo album in 1973, Grinding Stone (billed as \\&quot;the Gary Moore Band\\&quot;). In 1978 his solo career continued with help from Phil Lynott. The combination of Moore\\'s blues-based guitar and Lynott\\'s voice produced \\&quot;Parisienne Walkways\\&quot;, which reached the Top Ten in the UK Singles Chart in April 1979 and the Thin Lizzy album Black Rose: A Rock Legend which reached number two in the UK album chart. Moore appears in the videos for Waiting for an Alibi and Do Anything You Want To.\n\nIn 1987, Moore collaborated on the UK charity record \\&quot;Let It Be\\&quot;, a cover of The Beatles track. Moore performed a guitar solo for inclusion on the recording, which was released under the group-name of \\'Ferry Aid\\'. The record raised substantial funds for the survivors of the MS Herald of Free Enterprise disaster.\n\nIn 1993, Moore was included on a cassette called Rock Classics Vol. 1 with \\&quot;Run to Your Mama\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Dark Side of the Moog\\&quot;.\n\nAfter a series of rock records, Moore returned to blues music with Still Got the Blues, with contributions from Albert King, Albert Collins and George Harrison. The album was well received by fans. Moore stayed with the blues format until 1997, when he decided to experiment with modern dance beats on Dark Days in Paradise; this left many fans, as well as the music press, confused. Back to the Blues saw Moore return to his tried and tested blues format in 2001: he continued with this style on Power of the Blues (2004), Old New Ballads Blues (2006), Close As You Get (2007) and Bad For You Baby (2008). Moore also contributed guitar sections to Richard Blackwood\\'s 2000 album, You\\'ll Love to Hate This.\n\nMoore also took part in a comedy skit titled \\&quot;The Easy Guitar Book Sketch\\&quot; with comedian Rowland Rivron and fellow British musicians Mark Knopfler, Lemmy from Motorhead, Mark King from Level 42, and David Gilmour.\n\n\n\n\n\n              Gary Moore Ultimate Gary Moore 2011 320 Kbps \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6106867/Gary_Moore_Ultimate_Gary_Moore_2011_320_Kbps&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6106867/Gary_Moore_Ultimate_Gary_Moore_2011_320_Kbps&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:277587cfaaf25fb68e3c0b76d506e856e75814a1","amp;dn":"Gary+Moore+Live+Rest+In+Peace+2011+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"277587cfaaf25fb68e3c0b76d506e856e75814a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,117,135,207,170,242,95,182,142,60,11,118,213,6,232,86,231,88,20,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
