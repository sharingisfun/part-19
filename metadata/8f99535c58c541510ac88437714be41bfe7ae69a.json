While the defunct Velvet Underground were at the peak of their popularity at the time, Reed's solo career had hit several lows during the 80s, at least since his &quot;Blue Mask&quot;. However the widespread popularity of &quot;New York&quot; reignited his career to the extent that he could revive the VU for an (aborted) world tour.\n\nThe album is highly regarded for the strength and force of its lyrical content, but at the time drew criticism for its perceived pedestrian, &quot;truck driver&quot;, musicianship. Reed countered that he required simple music so that it would not distract from his frank lyrics. The single &quot;Dirty Blvd.&quot; was a #1 hit on the newly created Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for four weeks.
