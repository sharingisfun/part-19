Written after his return to Germany in 1949, the articles, essays, and radio talks included in this volume speak to the pressing political, cultural, and philosophical concerns of the postwar era. The pieces in Critical Models reflect the intellectually provocative as well as the practical Adorno as he addresses such issues as the dangers of ideological conformity, the fragility of democracy, educational reform, the influence of television and radio, and the aftermath of fascism.\n\nThis new edition includes an introduction by Lydia Goehr, a renowned scholar in philosophy, aesthetic theory, and musicology. Goehr illuminates Adorno's ideas as well as the intellectual, historical, and critical contexts that shaped his postwar thinking.\nGenre: Nonfiction, general\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc6d17915fef8214edb15afe7412be6eec18d167","amp;dn":"Critical+Models_+Interventions+and+Catch+-+Theodor+W.+Adorno.epu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc6d17915fef8214edb15afe7412be6eec18d167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,109,23,145,95,239,130,20,237,177,90,254,116,18,190,110,236,24,209,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
