The songs run between the extremes of fluid, guitar-driven rockers and ballads draped in flowing lyricism with harmony singing contributions from his one-time teenage bandmate Donny Ullstrom. Apart from a somewhat dullish rendition of &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me,&quot; the album works well, particularly a soulful and highly personalized rendition of &quot;Take It to the Limit.&quot; \nGuitarists Jerry Swallow and Steve Edwards, pianist John Hobbs, bassist Kerry Morris, and drummer Kelly Shanahan make a good band, and Ernie Watts contributes a beautifully understated sax solo on &quot;I Really Want You Here Tonight.&quot; &quot;Every Other Day&quot; sounds like a lost Eagles number, and &quot;Heartsong&quot; lives up to its title, ending the album on a deeply introspective note.\n\nEnjoy, please comment and seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1852ffc933fcc43a1e7b360b644e0539f1c594e","amp;dn":"Randy+Meisner+%5BEagles%5D+-+first+solo+album+-+%5B1978%5D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1852ffc933fcc43a1e7b360b644e0539f1c594e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,133,47,252,147,63,204,67,161,231,179,96,182,68,224,83,159,28,89,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
