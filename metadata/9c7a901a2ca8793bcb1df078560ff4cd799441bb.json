I lived in Los Angeles for a little while and saw some celebrities now and then, but for example, when I saw Ben Affleck sitting the next table over at lunch, I just laughed at him for going around with his drawers hanging out. That said, I did get nervous and excited when I saw ZoÃƒÂ« Keating at the airport. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not every day you have to weigh the likelihood that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make a total ass of yourself against the chance to shake hands with a personal hero.\n\nLike Rob Paravonian said, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cool to be an adult who plays the cello, but when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re youngerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just so much bully-fodder. For those of us desperately seeking cred, Ms. Keating was a goddess Ã¢â‚¬â€œ only a little older and made playing the cello undeniably cool. Now that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m no longer a high school orchestra nerd or going to a college where most of the students werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t aware we had an orchestra, and fall into the Ã¢â‚¬Å“adult who plays the cello,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (which = cool, for those of you having trouble keeping up) IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still awed and inspired by her music.\n\nHer new album, Into The Trees, is as sublime as I could have hoped. But, you ask, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t instrumental music (especially on an instrument like the cello), wellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ boring, Masterpiece Theater, dragged to the opera by your girlfriend, falling asleep in a tuxedo crap that you can only sit through by imagining robots invading and battling the musicians? UmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ no.\nHop over to the website to make that wondrous creation of sound and technology yours to keep for a measly $8.00. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve enjoyed the whole album quite a lot since its release last week, but the tracks I keep coming back to are Optimist, Hello Night, and DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Worry.\n\nOptimist sounds like optimism. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Worry sounds like a hug from a friend. The snozzberries taste like snozzberries! Wait. Strike that last. Hello Night makes you want it to get dark faster.\n\nIf you ignore me and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t listen, then your world is a lot more dull and lifeless than it needs to be.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c7a901a2ca8793bcb1df078560ff4cd799441bb","amp;dn":"Zo%26euml%3B+Keating+-+Into+The+Trees+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c7a901a2ca8793bcb1df078560ff4cd799441bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,122,144,26,44,168,121,59,203,29,240,120,86,15,244,205,121,148,65,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
