It offers what is frequently seen as a forbidden theory of the origin of religion that goes deep into evolution, especially but not exclusively cultural evolution.\n\nHow did our early ancestors transcend the quotidian demands of everyday existence to embrace an alternative reality that called into question the very meaning of their daily struggle? Robert Bellah, one of the leading sociologists of our time, identifies a range of cultural capacities, such as communal dancing, storytelling, and theorizing, whose emergence made this religious development possible. Deploying the latest findings in biology, cognitive science, and evolutionary psychology, he traces the expansion of these cultural capacities from the Paleolithic to the Axial Age (roughly, the first millennium BCE), when individuals and groups in the Old World challenged the norms and beliefs of class societies ruled by kings and aristocracies. These religious prophets and renouncers never succeeded in founding their alternative utopias, but they left a heritage of criticism that would not be quenched.\n\nBellahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s treatment of the four great civilizations of the Axial AgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in ancient Israel, Greece, China, and IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½shows all existing religions, both prophetic and mystic, to be rooted in the evolutionary story he tells. Religion in Human Evolution answers the call for a critical history of religion grounded in the full range of human constraints and possibilities.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily rich book based on wide-ranging scholarship. It contains not just a host of individual studies, but is informed with a coherent and powerful theoretical structure. There is nothing like it in existence. Of course, it will be challenged. But it will bring the debate a great step forward, even for its detractors. And it will enable other scholars to build on its insights in further studies of religion past and present.\n--Charles Taylor, author of A Secular Age and Dilemmas and Connections\n\nThis great book is the intellectual harvest of the rich academic life of a leading social theorist who has assimilated a vast range of biological, anthropological, and historical literature in the pursuit of a breathtaking project. Robert Bellah first searches for the roots of ritual and myth in the natural evolution of our species and then follows with the social evolution of religion up to the Axial Age. In the second part of his book, he succeeds in a unique comparison of the origins of the handful of surviving world-religions, including Greek philosophy. In this field I do not know of an equally ambitious and comprehensive study.\n--JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rgen Habermas\n\n784 pages\nBelknap Press of Harvard University Press \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31aafbdcd461b27869ea6f109a59b1bb68c7a502","amp;dn":"Religion+in+Human+Evolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31aafbdcd461b27869ea6f109a59b1bb68c7a502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,170,251,220,212,97,178,120,105,234,111,16,154,89,177,187,104,199,165,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
