Directed by Rollin Binzer and produced by Binzer and Marshall Chess, it was filmed in 16mm by Bob Freeze and Steve Gebhardt of Butterfly Films owned by John Lennon during four shows in Fort Worth and Houston, Texas, during the band's 1972 North American Tour in support of their classic 1972 album Exile on Main St.\n\n2010 theatrical re-release\n\nPrior to 2010, after initial showings in 1974 the movie was only commercially available in the early 1980s in Australia on VHS by Video Classics, of which bootleg copies had since been circulated. The Rolling Stones re-claimed the film from No Moss Partners, the original investment limited partnership in the late 1990s, and held off from re-releasing it until 2010. On September 16, 2010, a digital re-mastered version of Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones was shown in select theaters in the United States, presented by Omniverse Vision, Eagle Rock Entertainment and NCM Fathom. Re-mastered in HD digital, the film also features an introduction by Mick Jagger, interviewed in summer 2010 at the London Dorchester Hotel. This segment features Jagger reflecting on memories of the tour during this legendary time, and the status of The Rolling Stones. This film was released at selected Showcase Cinemas in UK the following day, on Friday 17 September 2010. On October 12, 2010, it was issued on DVD and Blu-Ray. Supplements to the concert footage includes tour rehearsal footage from the Montreux Jazz Festival, a 1972 Old Grey Whistle Test interview with Mick Jagger, and a 2010 interview with Mick Jagger.\n\nThe tracks in the film followed the running order of a typical setlist of the 1972 tour, with no original dating earlier than 1968. &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; was played at one of the filmed shows in Fort Worth but only occasionally elsewhere on the tour, and &quot;Rocks Off,&quot; played at all of the other 1972 tour shows, was notably absent from the film. All songs written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except for &quot;Love in Vain&quot; by Robert Johnson, and &quot;Bye Bye Johnny&quot; by Chuck Berry.\n\n    * &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;\n    * &quot;Bitch&quot;\n    * &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;\n    * &quot;Dead Flowers&quot;\n    * &quot;Happy&quot;\n    * &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;\n    * &quot;Love in Vain&quot;\n    * &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;\n    * &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot;\n    * &quot;All Down the Line&quot;\n    * &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;\n    * &quot;Bye Bye Johnny&quot;\n    * &quot;Rip This Joint&quot;\n    * &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot;\n    * &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40742c8242c432a2b4a6c9896225f084fde7fc9d","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Ladies+and+Gentlemen+%282010%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40742c8242c432a2b4a6c9896225f084fde7fc9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,116,44,130,66,196,50,162,180,166,201,137,98,37,240,132,253,231,252,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
