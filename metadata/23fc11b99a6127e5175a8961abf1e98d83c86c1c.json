Many of its songs reflect a more conventional pop-writing style and became radio hits, others still retain Gabriel's dark, brooding sense of experimentalism.\n\nIt is Peter Gabriel's second album produced by Canadian artist Daniel Lanois. The previous year, the two of them had worked together on Birdy. Lanois had been previously known for his ambient collaborations with Brian Eno as well as producing U2 since 1984. As he had with the soundtrack to the film Birdy, Lanois brought many of his own ambient sensibilities to this recording.\n\nThe album begins with &quot;Red Rain&quot;. Inspired by a recurring dream which Gabriel had of swimming in a sea of red water, its lyrics vividly depict dream imagery that reflect a sense of vulnerability. The song is one of the works in the story of Mozo, a wandering stranger who appears in several Gabriel songs. Of all the tracks on the album, Gabriel considers &quot;Red Rain&quot; one of his favourites.[1] Other Mozo works include &quot;On the Air&quot; and &quot;Exposure&quot;.\n\nThe second track is Gabriel's most popular single, &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;. &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; is a piece with Motown and world music influences, from its famous use of the shakuhachi. The video for &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; won MTV's 1987 Top Music Video Award. Directed by Steven Johnson, it features stop motion animation by Aardman Animations of Wallace and Gromit fame. The dancing chickens were animated by Nick Park. The video ends with Gabriel dancing in silhouette, covered with lights taped on his suit by a runner who later became a producer for the Wallace and Gromit films. While performing the song on his 2002 tour, Gabriel recreated this image by wearing a jacket covered with LED lights.\n\nTracks 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“6 include a duet with Kate Bush titled &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;, &quot;That Voice Again&quot;, and hit single &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;. &quot;Mercy Street&quot; is dedicated to poet Anne Sexton and takes its title from her 1969 play, Mercy Street (Sexton also posthumously released a book of poetry, 45 Mercy Street).\n\n\nCD ripped using EAC.  Log, cue and covers are included.\n\nFor more on flac:\nhttp://xs.vc/eac/index.html\nsourceforge.net\ndbpoweramp.com\nexactaudiocopy.de\n\nGabriel, Peter - So [Remastered]\n\n01.\tRed Rain\t\t05:39\n02.\tSledgehammer\t\t05:12\n03.\tDon't Give Up\t\t06:33\n04.\tThat Voice Again\t\t04:53\n05.\tMercy Street\t\t06:22\n06.\tBig Time\t\t04:28\n07.\tWe Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)\t\t03:22\n08.\tThis Is the Picture (Excellent Birds)\t\t04:25\n09.\tIn Your Eyes\t\t05:27\n\n\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 5 from 4.
