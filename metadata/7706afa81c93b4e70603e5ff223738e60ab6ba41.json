Minier, J. Pozorski (Springer, 2017).pdf\r\n\r\nThe book presents an up-to-date review of turbulent two-phase flows with the dispersed phase, with an emphasis on the dynamics in the near-wall region. New insights to the flow physics are provided by direct numerical simuation and by fine experimental techniques. Also included are models of particle dynamics in wall-bounded turbulent flows, and a description of particle surface interactions including muti-layer deposition and re-suspension","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7706afa81c93b4e70603e5ff223738e60ab6ba41","amp;dn":"Particles+in+Wall-Bounded+Turbulent+Flows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7706afa81c93b4e70603e5ff223738e60ab6ba41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,6,175,168,28,147,180,231,6,3,229,255,34,55,56,230,10,182,186,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
