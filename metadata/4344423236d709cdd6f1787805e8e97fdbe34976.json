West Side ChicagoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Jimmy Dawkins is one of this rare list and this compilation album is another proof. Album consists of three sets recorded at Kala Studios, Atlanta and produced by Bryan Cole (drummer). Ten compositions and ten unforgettable, classically performed blues. I can and must say this is the blues; raw, electrified Chicago blues. All ten compositions are great, no single one can be distinguished, but what drives here is JimmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar, which is some kind of fantastic; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s screaming, howling, even talking (Down With The Blues). A truly great guitarist whose playing encompasses the  listener. \nMany blues musicians, even great blues musicians have highly ranked albums where one or two compositions cannot keep within the bounds of the blues but this is not the case. No step is made aside from the blues, no single song is weak. We have here more than fifty minutes of pure Chicago blues.
