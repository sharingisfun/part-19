Here Come the Young Men\n\nWith their songs about rowdy nights out and morning after recriminations, The Courteeners have always seemed more comfortable and successful as a live band. Their two album releases so far, 2008's 'St. Jude' and 2010's 'Falcon', have been used mostly as live fodder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ justifying more lucrative big shows (which have tended to be Ã¢â‚¬ËœhomecomingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shows in Manchester). But seeing as playing live is the only way bands can make money these days, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a bad tactic at all Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and as the good careerist rock band that The Courteeners obviously are, this third album has been carefully engineered to take their live shows to the arenas and higher up the festival bills. 'ANNA' is an album designed first and foremost to be fun and entertaining Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an innocent form of skyscraping indie-rock made with escapism and crowd-participation in mind.\n\nThis is a colorful, engaging and enjoyably diverting listening experience. &quot;Are You In Love With a Notion&quot; is a brilliant sing-along album opener. Lead single &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; is a rollicking rock and roll stomp and &quot;Van Der Graaff&quot; shines as an addictive riff-heavy future single.\n\nThe album is helped not only by Liam FrayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s undoubted charisma (only he could get away with the &quot;tut tut finger wag&quot; line on &quot;Sharks Are Circling&quot;), but also his uncanny ability to write instantly memorable and classic choruses. 'ANNA' is littered with massive choruses that will have you singing along almost immediately.\n\nEven though 'ANNA' is geared towards a bigger sound, Fray is still very much centre-stage and has his quota of show-stopping and heartbreaking acoustic numbers that nicely show off his lyrical and tender side. &quot;Marquee&quot; is the best of these, which has Fray at his vulnerable and love-lorn best: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stay up late and think of where you might be / I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sleep IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the image of you and him in the marquee / He made you smile when did I stop doing that? / Was it happening for a while? / You should have just said instead IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m lying here wrestling demons in my bedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an emotional sucker-punch that works well alongside all the uptempo rocking and is sure to go down as a live favorite.\n\nFans of The Courteeners will undoubtedly herald 'ANNA' as their strongest and most consistent album yet. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been more of a casual listener, approach 'ANNA' as nothing more than a simple and innocent bit of foot-tapping, sing-along fun and you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be disappointed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01286f1dbe4ab3dd7dd86620288658a17cd8379d","amp;dn":"The+Courteeners+-+ANNA+%5B2013%5D%5B+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01286f1dbe4ab3dd7dd86620288658a17cd8379d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,40,111,29,190,74,179,221,125,216,102,32,40,134,88,161,124,216,55,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
