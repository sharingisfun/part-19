Formed by college friends vocalist/keyboardist Cy Curnin and drummer Adam Woods in the early '80s, the pair advertised in the music press for additional members; the remaining members of the group -- guitarist Jamie West-Oram, keyboardist Rupert Greenall, and bassist Charlie Barret -- all responded to the ad. Taking the name the Portraits, the band recorded a single for Ariola Records, &quot;Hazards in the Home,&quot; which failed to gather much attention. Within a year, the band had changed its name to the Fixx and recorded &quot;Lost Planes,&quot; the single that led to a record contract with MCA. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.73% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tKirtland Records\nCatalog:\t\tKR-67\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Anyone Else\n02.Just Before Dawn\n03.Take A Risk\n04.Beautiful Friction\n05.What God\n06.Second Time Around\n07.Follow That Cab\n08.Shaman\n09.Something Ahead Of You\n10.Girl With No Ceiling\n11.Small Thoughts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38866a7fd68813eeaf35b41f97c65485cbfb17fa","amp;dn":"The+Fixx+-+Beautiful+Friction+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38866a7fd68813eeaf35b41f97c65485cbfb17fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,134,106,127,214,136,19,238,175,53,180,31,151,198,84,133,203,251,23,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
