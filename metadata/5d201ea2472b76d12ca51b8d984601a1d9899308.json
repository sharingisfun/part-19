It was the perfect creepy landscape for imagining they were up against beasts and monsters and villains.\n\nJust as Gabe's decided he's outgrown their childish games, though, it appears that their most monstrous creation could be real.\n\nIs there a ghoulish man-eating creature prowling the woods for victims? Or is Seth just determined to make Gabe think so -- no matter who gets hurt in the process?\n\nGabe's not sure which answer would prove more unsettling, but he's determined to learn the truth.\n\nepub and mobi.
