But this year, instead of the three top-scoring dishes being guaranteed a place on the shortlist, only those that are deemed perfect will make the grade. So each day there may only be two dishes that make the judges shortlist, or perhaps only one.\r\n\r\nThe final menu will be chosen by the judges from the dishes that have been shortlisted, so to be in with a chance of cooking at the banquet, the chefs must have secured a place on the judge's shortlist at least once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 05-Oct-2015 to 09-Oct-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb657b34995e3a139f0748fd1bd77988d8ff31d1","amp;dn":"Great+British+Menu+S10E41-E45+Finals+Week+480p.HDTV.x264-RMTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb657b34995e3a139f0748fd1bd77988d8ff31d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,101,123,52,153,94,58,19,159,7,72,253,27,215,121,136,216,255,49,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
