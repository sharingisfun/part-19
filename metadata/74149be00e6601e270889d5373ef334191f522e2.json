He is widely considered to be the greatest electric guitarist in the history of rock music,[3][4][5] and one of the most influential musicians of his era across a range of genres.[6][7][8]\n\nAfter initial success in Europe, he achieved fame in the United States following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. He often favored raw overdriven amplifiers with high gain and treble and helped develop the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback.[9] Hendrix popularized use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock which he often used to deliver an exaggerated pitch in his solos, particularly with high bends and use of legato. He was influenced by blues artists such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Albert King and Elmore James,[10][11][12][13] rhythm and blues and soul guitarists Curtis Mayfield, Steve Cropper, as well as by funk and some modern jazz.[14] As a record producer, Hendrix also broke new ground in using the recording studio as an extension of his musical ideas. He was one of the first to experiment with stereophonic phasing effects for rock recording.\n\nHendrix won many of the most prestigious rock music awards in his lifetime, and has been posthumously awarded many more, including being inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. An English Heritage blue plaque was erected in his name on his former residence at Brook Street, London, in September 1997. A star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (at 6627 Hollywood Blvd.) was dedicated in 1994. In 2006, his debut US album, Are You Experienced, was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry, and Rolling Stone named Hendrix the top guitarist on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all-time in 2003.[15] He was the first person inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValleys of Neptune 2010\n\n\nValleys of Neptune is a posthumous eleventh studio album by American psychedelic rock musician Jimi Hendrix. Released in the United States on March 9, 2010, the album boasts &quot;12 previously unreleased studio recordings,&quot;[1] including the title track, &quot;one of the most sought after of all of Hendrix's commercially unavailable recordings.&quot;[1] The tracks on Valleys of Neptune were largely self-produced by Hendrix, and received extra posthumous production from Janie Hendrix, Eddie Kramer and John McDermott for Experience Hendrix, L.L.C.[2] Recorded mostly in 1969 following the release of Electric Ladyland, the album predominantly features the original lineup of The Jimi Hendrix Experience: vocalist and guitarist Hendrix, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell.[2] The lead single released from the album was &quot;Valleys of Neptune&quot;, on February 1, 2010, followed by &quot;Bleeding Heart&quot; on March 1;[3] music videos were produced for both songs.\n\nThe majority of the tracks featured on Valleys of Neptune were recorded in early 1969, while Hendrix was experimenting with songs for his unfinished fourth album, following the successful release of Electric Ladyland in September 1968. Numerous versions have been released, both officially and otherwise, and the majority of the 'previously unreleased' recordings present on the 2010 album have been released in one form or another before, albeit sometimes in inferior quality or different versions\n\n\nWriting for music website MusicRadar.com, critic Joe Bosso compiled a track-by-track review of Valleys of Neptune, an album in the whole that he described as &quot;one of the best albums of 2010&quot;.[7] Ludovic Hunter-Tilney in the Financial Times was equally positive, awarding the album a four-star (of a maximum five) rating and describing it as &quot;a cut above the many posthumous cash-ins released in [Hendrix's] name.&quot;[8] Ann Powers in the Los Angeles Times awarded the album &quot;Two and a half stars (Out of four)&quot;, summarising her review by saying: &quot;Fans will be fascinated by these bluesy riffs with the Experience, but this album of unreleased material from the archives doesn't convey much that was unknown.&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Stone Free&quot;  \n3:45\n2.\t&quot;Valleys of Neptune&quot;  \n4:01\n3.\t&quot;Bleeding Heart&quot; (Elmore James cover)\n6:20\n4.\t&quot;Hear My Train a Comin'&quot;  \t7:29\n5.\t&quot;Mr. Bad Luck&quot;  \t2:56\n6.\t&quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; (instrumental Cream cover)\n6:45\n7.\t&quot;Lover Man&quot;  \n4:15\n8.\t&quot;Ships Passing Through the Night&quot;  \t5:52\n9.\t&quot;Fire&quot;  \n3:12\n10.\t&quot;Red House&quot;  \n8:20\n11.\t&quot;Lullaby for the Summer&quot; (instrumental)\t3:48\n12.\t&quot;Crying Blue Rain&quot;  \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74149be00e6601e270889d5373ef334191f522e2","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+Valleys+of+Neptune+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74149be00e6601e270889d5373ef334191f522e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,20,155,224,14,102,1,226,112,136,157,83,115,239,51,65,145,245,34,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
