Pasolini, Fellini, BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel, Glauber Rocha and the Brazilian tradition of experimental Super 8 films are here condensed in a thrilling series of radically imaginative sequences describing reality as experienced by a schizophrenic bump whose trajectory runs through exposing his body, sexuality, poetry and imaginary in the streets of Salvador, in the years just after the end of military dictatorship in Brazil. A monumental and highly poetical chronicle of the body in the context of culture, power and politics in a general way.\n\nFile Size (in bytes):                           765,663,232                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                             96          \nPreload (in ms):                                96       \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Split         \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  XVID              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            45:36.337                \nFrame Count:                                    65607             \nFrame Width x Height (pixels):                  640 x 480 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;                    1.333                     \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:                              23.976          \nPics Per Second:                                23.976            \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1975                 \nMPEG-4:                                         MPEG-4                   \n[B-VOP][QPel][GMC][NVOP][H264]:                 [B-VOP][][][][]   \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.268&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nMPEG Stream ID (e.g. &quot;0xbd&quot;):                             \nMPEG VOB file Substream(e.g. &quot;0x80&quot;):                  \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            256                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            CBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c8c0f0b3509a2bad140f2bf21cca2edb7ea55a1","amp;dn":"SuperOutro+%28Edgar+Navarro%2C+1989%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c8c0f0b3509a2bad140f2bf21cca2edb7ea55a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,140,15,11,53,9,162,186,209,64,242,191,33,204,162,237,183,234,85,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
