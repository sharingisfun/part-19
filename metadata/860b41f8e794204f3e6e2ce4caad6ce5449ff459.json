One of the most acclaimed bands of the Classic Rock era, Bad Company put their indelible stamp on Rock 'n' Roll with the creation of some of the most timeless Rock anthems of all time. This special sold-out show saw the legendary supergroup reform for their first performance together in nearly a decade, featuring the original founding line-up of vocalist Paul Rodgers (Free, Queen), guitarist Mick Ralphs (Mott The Hoople) and drummer Simon Kirke (Free). Aptly filmed at Hollywood's Hard Rock Live on 08-08-08, this remarkable reunion showcases all of the band's multi-platinum hits including 'Can't Get Enough', 'Feel Like Makin Love' and 'Rock Steady'.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01.
