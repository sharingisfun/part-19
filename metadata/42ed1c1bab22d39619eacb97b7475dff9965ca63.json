I have some anniversary\nepisodes of the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and Late Night with David\nLetterman, as well as the 1993 MTV Music Video Awards.\n\n\nThis is the 27th anniversary episode of the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, \nwhich aired in prime time on October 26, 1989.  The sound is kinda muffled \nand the video quality isn't great, but that is to be expected given that it \nwas taped from TV almost 25 years ago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42ed1c1bab22d39619eacb97b7475dff9965ca63","amp;dn":"Tonight+Show+with+Johnny+Carson+-+27th+Anniversary+%5BVHS+rip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42ed1c1bab22d39619eacb97b7475dff9965ca63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,237,28,27,171,34,211,150,25,234,203,151,183,71,93,255,153,101,202,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
