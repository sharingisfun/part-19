If this doesn't agree with you, they are easy, if tedious, to rename.\n\nYes, it's a big torrent. Some episodes are quite grainy and a lower bitrate would have been detrimental to the quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbabf6e841467a45f14ef685382c966feec0f9dc","amp;dn":"Jeremy+Brett+-+The+Adventures+of+Sherlock+Holmes+%281984-94%29+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbabf6e841467a45f14ef685382c966feec0f9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,171,246,232,65,70,122,69,241,78,246,133,56,44,150,111,238,192,249,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
