It was certified Gold on June 23, 1977, having shipped 500,000 copies. The album was re-released in 1997 in a remastered version. It peaked on the charts at #100,[3] without the benefit of a hit single. Many of the album's songs are live staples for the band, including &quot;Got to Choose&quot;, &quot;Parasite&quot;, &quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot;, &quot;Let Me Go, Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, and &quot;Watchin' You&quot;.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Got to Choose&quot;   \tPaul Stanley \tStanley \t3:54\n02. \t&quot;Parasite&quot;   \tAce Frehley \tGene Simmons \t3:02\n03. \t&quot;Goin' Blind&quot;   Simmons \t3:37\n04. \t&quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot;   \tStanley \tStanley \t3:30\n05. \t&quot;Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll&quot;   \tSimmons \t2:15\n06. \t&quot;All the Way&quot;   \tSimmons \tSimmons \t3:18\n07. \t&quot;Watchin' You&quot;   \tSimmons \tSimmons \t3:44\n08. \t&quot;Mainline&quot;   \tStanley \tPeter Criss \t3:50\n09. \t&quot;Comin' Home&quot;   \tFrehley, Stanley \tStanley \t2:38\n10. \t&quot;Strange Ways&quot;   \tFrehley \tCriss \t3:18\n\n\nDespite the intense touring schedule Kiss maintained in 1974, Hotter Than Hell failed to outperform the band's first album and fared considerably worse. This was due partly to the fact that Casablanca Records' distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records had ended. The publicity push behind the album was not nearly what it was for the debut album. One notable exception was a television commercial aired to promote the album. The only single released from the album &quot;Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll&quot;, was distributed in low numbers and failed to chart. Four months after the album was released, Kiss were pulled off tour and called back into the studio to record a follow-up. Hotter Than Hell was certified Gold on June 23, 1977. \n\nMusically, Hotter Than Hell is darker than the band's first album. This is partly due to the murkier production values, but also the lyrical content of some of the songs. &quot;Goin' Blind&quot;, which details a doomed romance with a 93-year-old and an underage girl, was a song written by Simmons and Stephen Coronel during their days with Wicked Lester. The original title was &quot;Little Lady&quot;. Hotter Than Hell featured a lot more overdubs than the first album. While Kerner and Wise wanted to produce a record that captured Kiss as a live act, they decided to take advantage of the experience the band had gained as recording artists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4348b250d102c1fb53dfa1fd42b0e5b7076fb3c0","amp;dn":"KISS+-+%27Hotter+Than+Hell%27+%5BREMASTERED%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4348b250d102c1fb53dfa1fd42b0e5b7076fb3c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,72,178,80,209,2,193,251,83,223,161,253,66,176,229,183,7,111,179,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
