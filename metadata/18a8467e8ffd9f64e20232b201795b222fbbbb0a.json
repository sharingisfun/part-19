A glorious selection of material, from Neil Young\\'s \\'Powderfinger\\' to the traditional favorite \\'Big Rock Candy Mountain\\'. \n\nGlad \\'n\\' Greasy, a perfect phrase for the late, lamented Farmers. This EP was recorded in Europe around 1986 and features the original Beat Farmers line-up of Rolle Dexter Love (bass), Jerry Raney (guitar/voc), Buddy Blue(guitar/voc) and Country Dick Montana (drums/voc/beer runs). The brevity of this CD is far overwhelmed by the sheer, gut-crunching cow-punk-folk-a-billy of the six songs. It starts out with a powerful swinging version of Neil Young\\'s \\&quot;Powderfinger\\&quot;. \\&quot;Death Train\\&quot;, \\&quot;Delayed Reaction\\&quot;, and the title track all showcase a combination of twang, swang, and good time rock \\'n roll that enraptured many a beer-soaked crowd during the Farmers\\' all too brief history. For sheer fun, Country Dick takes the mic for the old bums\\' anthem \\&quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain\\&quot;, restoring it to its original paean to riding the rails, stealing, and drinking. For sheer twistedness, Dick\\'s reading of \\&quot;Beat Generation\\&quot; must simply be heard to be believed. Once you\\'ve heard this, life indeed will be just ducky. \n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nCountry Dick Montana (Dan McLain) (drums, guitar, vocals) \nJerry Raney (guitar, vocals) \nRolle Dexter Love (bass) \nBuddy Blue (guitar, vocals)\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
