A reluctant voyager crosses the Pacific in 1850. A disinherited composer gatecrashes in between-wars Belgium. A vanity publisher flees gangland creditors. Others are a journalist in Governor ReaganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s California, and genetically-modified dinery server on death-row. Finally, a young Pacific Islander witnesses the nightfall of science and civilization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d1d7f6590f995862e67458968f1434c495c251d","amp;dn":"Cloud+Atlas+-+A+David+Mitchell+Novel.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d1d7f6590f995862e67458968f1434c495c251d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,29,127,101,144,249,149,134,46,103,69,137,104,241,67,76,73,92,37,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
