In Chemoinformatics and Computational Chemical Biology, leading investigators bring together a detailed series of reviews and methods including, among others, system-directed approaches using small molecules, the design of target-focused compound libraries, the study of molecular selectivity, and the systematic analysis of target-ligand interactions. Furthermore, the book delves into similarity methods, machine learning, probabilistic approaches, fragment-based methods, as well as topics that go beyond the current chemoinformatics spectrum, such as knowledge-based modeling of G protein-coupled receptor structures and computational design of siRNA libraries. As a volume in the highly successful Methods in Molecular BiologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ series, this collection provides detailed descriptions and implementation advice that are exceedingly relevant for basic researchers and practitioners in this highly interdisciplinary research and development area. Cutting-edge and unambiguous, Chemoinformatics and Computational Chemical Biology serves as an ideal guide for experts and newcomers alike to this vital and dynamic field of study.\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 598 pages\n# Publisher: Humana Press; 1st Edition. edition (September 17, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1607618389\n# ISBN-13: 978-1607618386","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6196d4342fdf114c5f2a472c88534b0e095f6ae6","amp;dn":"Chemoinformatics+and+Computational+Chemical+Biology%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6196d4342fdf114c5f2a472c88534b0e095f6ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,150,212,52,47,223,17,76,95,42,71,44,136,83,75,14,9,95,106,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
