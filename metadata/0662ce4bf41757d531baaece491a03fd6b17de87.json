Release: 1990. With Covers &amp; Discography \n\nIn the 1950s, Canadian performer Hank Snow, the Singing Ranger, became a full-fledged country star, and had a remarkable string of hits during the decade. Following in the footsteps of his ever-travelin' hero, Jimmie Rodgers (aka the Singing Brakeman), Snow issued twangy tales of wanderlust such as &quot;The Golden Rocket,&quot; a fast-paced tune about riding the rails, and the lovelorn &quot;Big Wheels,&quot; both presented on this massive four-disc Bear Family box set.\n\nThe incredibly thorough 112-track collection also features Snow's forays into Hawaiian music, including the lilting &quot;Hula Rock&quot; and the laid-back &quot;Sing Me a Song of the Islands,&quot; proving that he was willing to venture down a number of stylistic paths (see also &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; and &quot;Brahms' Lullaby&quot; as well). With his deep voice and bold delivery, Snow also excelled at ballads, and there are many on this compilation, including the wistful &quot;Born to Lose&quot; and the blissful &quot;Memories Are Made of This.&quot; Although THE SINGING RANGER VOL. 2 is geared toward Snow completists, listeners willing to dive way deep into his '50s material will be richly rewarded with these wonderfully dynamic songs.\n\nVolume 2 features 112 tracks 1953-58 plus 16-page booklet. 4-CD deluxe box, priced as CX-4 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0662ce4bf41757d531baaece491a03fd6b17de87","amp;dn":"Hank+Snow+-+The+Singing+Ranger+Vol.+2+%5B1953-1958%5D+4CD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0662ce4bf41757d531baaece491a03fd6b17de87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,98,206,75,244,23,87,213,49,186,174,206,73,26,3,253,107,23,222,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
