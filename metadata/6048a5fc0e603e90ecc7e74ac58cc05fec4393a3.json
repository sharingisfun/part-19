Fronting the most musically articulate band he had ever assembled--Reed and Robert Quine on guitar, Fernando Saunders on bass and Fred Maher on drums--Reed performs a treasure trove of his best hits. The energy and interplay on stage is so intense that it grabs the raw nerve of rock 'n' roll urgency.
