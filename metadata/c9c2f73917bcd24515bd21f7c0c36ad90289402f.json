At number 21, here's Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band with, 'We've Got Tonight'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is a hit by the most successful studio musician turned singer of all time. This man previously recorded for Elvis Presley, The Mamas and the Pappas, Rick Nelson, The Association, Herb Alpert, Frank Sinatra, The Beach Boys, Johnny Cash, and many others.\n\nCasey spotlights the only song by Elton John, in his eight-year career, never even to make the hot 100, but it still sold a million copies.\n\nCasey tells about the latest tour by a band with a stage production which includes 60 tons of equipment, 48 roadies, 7 tractor-trailers, and a stage prop 50 feet in diameter, standing two stories tall, which begins to roar and smoke before lifting off the stage at the beginning of the show (and they're in this countdown with a double-sided hit!).\n\nCasey plays an extra by a group who got their start singing Christmas carols in the back of an old Rambler station-wagon. As of 1978, they were the biggest selling American group in chart history.\n\nA listener wants to know which instrumentalist leads in having the most (instrumental) top 40 albums. From 1952 to 1972, this man had 33 top 40 albums.\n\nCasey plays the biggest selling single of all time, which appeared on the pop chart every year around the holidays from 1942 through 1951, and then again from 1954 through 1962!\n\nFor the number one song, Casey plays the fake duet by Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand which was first artificially put together by a broadcaster and inspired the actual hit.\n\n40: Don't Hold Back - Chanson\n39: I Will Be In Love With You - Livingston Taylor\n38: Can You Fool - Glen Campbell\n37: My Best Friend's Girl - Cars\n36: There'll Never Be - Switch\n35: I Was Made For Dancing - Leif Garrett\nEXTRA: Step Into Christmas - Elton John\n34: Instant Replay - Dan Hartman\n33: Run For Home - Lindisfarne\n32: Fire - Pointer Sisters\n31: September - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\nARCHIVES: You've Got A Friend - James Taylor\n30: Shake It - Ian Matthews\n29: Double Vision - Foreigner\n28: Every 1's A Winner - Hot Chocolate\n27: Bicycle Race / Fat Bottomed Girls - Queen\n26: A Little More Love - Olivia Newton-John\nEXTRA: Merry Christmas Darling - The Carpenters\n25: New York Groove - Ace Frehley\nEXTRA: Oh Holy Night - Nat King Cole\n24: Power Of Gold - Dan Fogelberg &amp; Tim Weisberg\n23: I'm Every Woman - Chaka Khan\n22: Part Time Love - Elton John\n21: We've Got Tonight - Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band\nARCHIVES: How Can You Mend A Broken Heart - Bee Gees\n20: Alive Again - Chicago\n19: Promises - Eric Carmen\n18: Ooh Baby Baby - Linda Ronstadt\nEXTRA: Little Saint Nick - Beach Boys\n17: Sweet Life - Paul Davis\n16: How You Gonna See Me Now - Alice Cooper\n15: Straight On - Heart\n14: How Much I Feel - Ambrosia\n13: Hold The Line - Toto\n12: YMCA - Village People\n11: Strange Way - Firefall\nARCHIVES: Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey - Paul &amp; Linda McCartney\n10: Macarthur Park - Donna Summer\n9: Our Love, Don't Throw It Away - Andy Gibb\n8: Sharing The Night Together - Dr. Hook\nEXTRA: White Christmas - Bing Crosby\n7: Time Passages - Al Stewart\nLDD: This One's For You - Barry Manilow\n6: I Love The Nightlife - Alicia Bridges\nEXTRA: The Christmas Song - Nat King Cole\n5: My Life - Billy Joel\n4: I Just Wanna Stop - Gino Vanelli\n3: Too Much Heaven - Bee Gees\n2: Le Freak - Chic\n1: You Don't Bring Me Flowers - Barbra Streisand &amp; Neil Diamond","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c2f73917bcd24515bd21f7c0c36ad90289402f","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_December_16th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c2f73917bcd24515bd21f7c0c36ad90289402f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,194,247,57,23,188,210,69,21,189,33,247,192,195,106,217,2,137,64,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
