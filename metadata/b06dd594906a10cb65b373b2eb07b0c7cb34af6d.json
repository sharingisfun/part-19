Using ageing Vulcan bombers, crews flew a round trip of 8000 miles from Ascension Island to the South Atlantic. Such a journey required not just in-flight refuelling, but re-fuelling of the refuelling planes - a hazardous undertaking that had never before been attempted on such a scale.\n\nIn this drama, Robin Glendinning recreates the nail-biting adventure. Not only were the raids themselves difficult to pull off, but even getting the aircraft ready for the flights was a major task. Aviation museums across the world were raided for spares, and key parts retrieved from junkyards.\n\nBut there are those who question whether or not the operation was militarily useful - or whether or not the same job could have been done more effectively using planes attached to the naval task force. Was this really about war, or was it about the RAF trying to carve out a role for itself in a conflict that threatened to be entirely dominated by the Army and Royal Navy? And how successful were the raids anyway?\n\nProducer: Jolyon Jenkins.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jhb3d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jhb3d&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat                      : MPEG-4\nCodec Id                    : M4A \nDuration (ms)               : 45mn 0s\nTotal bitrate               : 131 Kbps\nPerformer                   : BBC Radio\nRecorded_Date               : 2012-06-05T14:15:00+01:00\nEncoded application         : Lavf53.4.0\nCopyright                   : Ã‚Â© 2012 British Broadcasting Corporation, all rights reserved\n\nFormat info                 : Advanced Audio Codec\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nChannelPositions            : Front: L R\nSampling rate               : 44.1 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 41.2 MB (98%)\n\nPlay using VLC: http://www.videolan.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b06dd594906a10cb65b373b2eb07b0c7cb34af6d","amp;dn":"Afternoon_Drama_-_Operation_Black_Buck_b01jhb3d.m4a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b06dd594906a10cb65b373b2eb07b0c7cb34af6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,109,213,148,144,106,16,203,101,179,115,178,235,7,176,199,203,52,175,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
