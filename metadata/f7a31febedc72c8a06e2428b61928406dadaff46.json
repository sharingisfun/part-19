On Amazon, there are over 1700 reviews raving about this version, and it had accolades laid on it by the NY Times as well. \n\nFrom Publishers Weekly \nStarred Review. Lee&amp;#039;s beloved American classics makes its belated debut on audio (after briefly being available in the 1990s for the blind and libraries through Books on Tape) with the kind of classy packaging that may spoil listeners for all other audiobooks. The two CD slipcases housing the 11 discs not only feature art mirroring Mary Schuck&amp;#039;s cover design but also offers helpful track listings for each disk. Many viewers of the 1962 movie adaptation believe that Lee was the film&amp;#039;s narrator, but it was actually an unbilled Kim Stanley who read a mere six passages and left an indelible impression. Competing with Stanley&amp;#039;s memory, Spacek forges her own path to a victorious reading. Spacek reads with a slight Southern lilt and quiet authority. Told entirely from the perspective of young Scout Finch, there&amp;#039;s no need for Spacek to create individual voices for various characters but she still invests them all with emotion. Lee&amp;#039;s Pulitzer PrizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“winning 1960 novel, which quietly stands as one of the most powerful statements of the Civil Rights movement, has been superbly brought to audio. Available as a Perennial paperback. (Aug.) \n\nI did by best with the rip, but if anyone finds a glitch, please post and I&amp;#039;ll post a repaired version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7a31febedc72c8a06e2428b61928406dadaff46","amp;dn":"Sissy+Spacek+reads+To+Kill+a+Mockingbird","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7a31febedc72c8a06e2428b61928406dadaff46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,163,31,235,237,199,44,138,6,226,66,139,97,146,132,6,218,218,255,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
