The remastering for the 2004 version greatly amplified the album's volume. It might also strip away some reverb from the instrumentation, but the latter observation is mostly theoretical, as the later No Control really just sounds louder. This is welcome, as it makes the band sound that much more direct on principal cuts like &quot;I Want to Conquer the World,&quot; &quot;Automatic Man,&quot; the aggressive title track, and &quot;Progress.&quot; \n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1989\nLabel: Epitaph\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Punk\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks: \n\n1. \tChange of Ideas \t        0:55\n2. \tBig Bang    \t                1:42\n3. \tNo Control  \t \t        1:46\n4. \tSometimes I Feel Like           1:34\n5. \tAutomatic Man     \t        1:40\n6. \tI Want to Conquer the World     2:19\n7. \tSanity    \t         \t2:44\n8. \tHenchman    \t         \t1:07\n9. \tIt Must Look Pretty Appealing   1:23\n10. \tYou      \t        \t2:05\n11. \tProgress    \t        \t2:14\n12. \tI Want Something More    \t0:47\n13. \tAnxiety    \t        \t2:08\n14. \tBilly    \t        \t1:54\n15. \tThe World Won't Stop    \t1:57\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f3a3f4f070d57584c3c3554343ec61025fdf6e","amp;dn":"Bad+Religion+-+No+Control+%281989%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-politux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f3a3f4f070d57584c3c3554343ec61025fdf6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,243,163,244,240,112,213,117,132,195,195,85,67,67,236,97,2,95,223,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
