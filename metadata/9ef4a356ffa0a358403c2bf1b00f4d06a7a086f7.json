When local gangster Big Ger Cafferty receives an identical message, Clarke decides that the recently retired John Rebus may be able to help. Together the two old adversaries might just stand a chance of saving Cafferty's skin.\r\n\r\nBut a notorious family tailed by a team of undercover detectives has also arrived in Edinburgh.
