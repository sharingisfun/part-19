These are not separate audio tracks. There are subtitles in English, French and Spanish.\n\nAlan Bates plays a Scottish soldier, Pvt. Charles Plumpick, who is given a mission in a small French town, only to discover that all its &quot;normal&quot; inhabitants have flown the coop, and the only ones left have been released from the local sanitarium. He falls for the ethereal Coquelicot, played by Genevieve Bujold.\n\nWonderful acting all around. I can't quite think of any film to compare this one with. The lack of inhibition in using so many languages, and the atmosphere of the sane versus the insane.  It will be scorched on your retinas and imprinted on your brain tissue.\n\nUncompressed NTSC VIDEO_TS folder.\n\nLetterboxed widescreen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70deee4bcd8f1ab7244195649baefdc8e3486caa","amp;dn":"Philippe+de+Broca+-+Le+Roi+de+coeur%2FKing+of+Hearts+-+1966","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70deee4bcd8f1ab7244195649baefdc8e3486caa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,222,238,75,205,143,26,183,36,65,149,100,155,174,253,200,227,72,108,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
