All the robots have at least four attack types: a light weapon, a heavy weapon, a melee attack, and the ability to throw objects such as cars, lamp posts, trees, etc. As its title and characters imply, a robot can transform into a vehicle and viceversa, this gives the game some racing elements, as the player must, in some missions, race to certain point within a time limit or before a character of the opposing faction does. Each area is a open world environment, and there are also side-missions, Energon cubes and Autobot/Decepticon emblems scattered through the city, if accomplished successfully/collected the player can unlock trailers, production photos and unlock color schemes for certain characters.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:527afda193b58c658866632fa7750ab29bfc10cc","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+Transformers+The+Game+%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"527afda193b58c658866632fa7750ab29bfc10cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,122,253,161,147,181,140,101,136,102,99,47,167,117,10,178,155,252,16,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
