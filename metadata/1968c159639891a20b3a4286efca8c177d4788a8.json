The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1968c159639891a20b3a4286efca8c177d4788a8","amp;dn":"PeridexisErrant+LNP+r67","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1968c159639891a20b3a4286efca8c177d4788a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,104,193,89,99,152,145,162,11,58,66,134,239,202,140,23,125,71,136,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
