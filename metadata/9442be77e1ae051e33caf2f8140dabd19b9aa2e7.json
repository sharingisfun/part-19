Learn how to reproduce missing pieces for 3D printing with Photoshop. Steve Caplin walks through two sample projects covering the major steps: producing the outline of the piece with a photograph or existing copy, extruding it in 3D space, and preparing it for print. Using an at-home 3D printer or a 3D printing service like Shapeways, you can reproduce a variety of buttons, game pieces, knobs, keys, and other small parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9442be77e1ae051e33caf2f8140dabd19b9aa2e7","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+3D+Print+Small+Objects+with+Photoshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9442be77e1ae051e33caf2f8140dabd19b9aa2e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,66,190,119,225,174,5,30,51,202,242,248,20,13,171,209,155,154,162,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
