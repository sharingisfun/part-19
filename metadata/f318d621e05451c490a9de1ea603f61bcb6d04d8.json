Combining real life stories with cutting edge science, it offers a refreshing insight into contemporary family life. \u000b\u000bEvery two years, the filmmakers revisit these children and their families to gain an in-depth snapshot of their lives, examining what it takes to give a child the best chance in life. Now, with our children having reached the critical age of seven, and in the midst of profound life changes, this two-part series explores their first tentative steps towards independence and self-identity. For the first time, in Life at 7, we hear directly from the children as they speak about who they are, and how they see themselves in their ever-expanding world.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3041192/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3041192/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f318d621e05451c490a9de1ea603f61bcb6d04d8","amp;dn":"Life.at.7.episode2.ABC.2012.x264.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f318d621e05451c490a9de1ea603f61bcb6d04d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,24,214,33,224,84,81,196,144,169,222,30,166,3,246,27,203,109,4,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
