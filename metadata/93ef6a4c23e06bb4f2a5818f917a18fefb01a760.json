Even as cars, jazz, film, and radio heralded the modern age, television haunted the modern imagination. During the 1920s and 1930s, U.S. television was a topic of conversation and speculation. Was it technically feasible? Could it be commercially viable? What would it look like? How might it serve the public interest? And what was its place in the modern future? These questions were not just asked by the American public, but also posed by the people intimately involved in televisionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creation. Their answers may have been self-serving, but they were also statements of aspiration. Idealistic imaginations of the medium and its impact on social relations became a de facto plan for moving beyond film and radio into a new era.\n\nIn Television in the Age of Radio, Philip W. Sewell offers a unique account of how television came to beÃ¢â‚¬â€not just from technical innovations or institutional struggles, but from cultural concerns that were central to the rise of industrial modernity. This book provides sustained investigations of the values of early television amateurs and enthusiasts, the fervors and worries about competing technologies, and the ambitions for programming that together helped mold the medium.\n\nSewell presents a major revision of the history of television, telling us about the nature of new media and how hopes for the future pull together diverse perspectives that shape technologies, industries, and audiences.\n\nReviews\n&quot;This brilliant example of a materialist analysis of technology shows how the fevered fantasies of television's early years were 'acts of invention as real as soldering together circuits in a lab.'&quot;(Thomas Streeter author of The Net Effect: Romanticism, Capitalism, and the Internet 2013-02-22)\n\n&quot;With valuable scholarship, Sewell provides a useful corrective to the existing account of the prehistory of television and illuminates the formative processes of television as a medium.&quot;(Alexander Russo author of Points on the Dial: Golden Age Radio beyond the Networks 2013-02-27)\n\n&quot;Philip SewellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exploration of radio-era television powerfully illuminates a formative chapter in the mediumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history, one with special relevance today as the constellation of practices called television continues to transform.&quot;(William Uricchio Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2013-07-09)\n\nAbout the Author\nPHILIP W.
