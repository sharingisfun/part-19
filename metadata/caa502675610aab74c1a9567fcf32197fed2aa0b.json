However, there are lots of great Class III firearms and suppressors involved in the demonstrations. It is exceptionally in-depth analysis of ballistic effects, including the power and accuracy of rounds fired through glass, underbrush, etc. It has a number of very exotic weapons including: The Mac 10 briefcase setup, a variety of homebuilt .50 cal rifles, a ton of suppressed pistols and rifles (10/22, .45, etc) and their unsuppressed counterparts. I was blown away the first time I saw it when one of the hosts has another host shoot him from about 3 feet away with a FAL to test a bullet proof vest and to prove people don&amp;#039;t get blown over by a gun shot to the chest. The owner of second chance actually shoots himself at point blank with a .44 Magnum to show off his vest too.\n\nDeadly Weapons is a video that shows What firearms Will &amp; Will Not Do This film provides those interested in the terminal effects of firearms with a unique examination of what modern firearms will and will not do.
