He was rehabilitated with the aid of Nigel Watson, the late Cozy Powell and other friends, and then began touring and recording with the Splinter Group. The group was disbanded in early 2004 with Green's departure from the group Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an upcoming tour was cancelled, as was the planned release of a new album.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlues Don't Change is an album by the British blues band the Peter Green Splinter Group, led by Peter Green. Originally released in 2001 and only available at concerts or via the band's official website, this was their seventh album. It was later given a full release on 3 April 2006, and again in 2012. Green was the founder of Fleetwood Mac and a member of that group from 1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ70, before a sporadic solo career during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe opening track, &quot;I Believe My Time Ain't Long&quot;, is a variation on the Robert Johnson song &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;. Green had first recorded the track with Fleetwood Mac in 1967 (variously credited to Elmore James or Jeremy Spencer), and it had been released as the band's first single.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPersonnel:\n\nPeter Green: guitars, harmonica, vocals\nNigel Watson: guitar, vocals\nRoger Cotton: keyboards\nPete Stroud: bass guitar\nLarry Tolfree: drums, percussion\n\n\nRecorded at Roundel Studio, Kent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0efbaf527e3abbecda863764cf15ed6745c4d679","amp;dn":"Peter+Green+Splinter+Group%2FBlues+Don%27t+Change+%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0efbaf527e3abbecda863764cf15ed6745c4d679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,251,175,82,126,58,187,236,218,134,55,100,207,21,237,103,69,196,214,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
