It was the soundtrack album for the film of the same name.\nThough Oldfield's music had been used in films before (The Exorcist and The Space Movie), this was the first time he had written specifically for film, and so far the only time. Oldfield composed the album on a Fairlight CMI.\n\nLike many movies, the album is not a comprehensive record of all the Oldfield soundtrack music used in the film. Most notably, the music accompanying the darkroom sequence does not feature on the album. The single from the album, &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tude&quot;, is taken from the Francisco Tarrega piece &quot;Recuerdos de la Alhambra&quot;.\n\nOldfield spent six months working on the score for The Killing Fields before going on tour, but when Oldfield returned the producers of the film asked for more music to be written, prompting Oldfield to ask for the use of an orchestra and a choir; three months later the score was finished.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
