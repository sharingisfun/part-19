Original format H.264 in an mp4 container. Converted to standard XviD format by popular demand due to the way H.264 could play on an unprepared PC. The frame rate is correct and the original, I'm usually picky about the 25fps. It generally means it's a PAL standard and the voices would be higher pitched. But this is the original frame rate and format and isn't the case.\n\nEpisode Description:\n\nA Romulan weapons test goes awry and snares the Enterprise in an inter-dimensional trap. Lt. Commander Sulu returns to find himself 30 years out of place and the key to saving the crew of the Enterprise as the precarious grasp on their own dimension begins to slip. Guest starring George Takei, who returns to the role of Hikaru Sulu, which he played on television in Star Trek (TOS) and in Star Trek: Voyager, as well as in the six feature Star Trek films. Written by Michael Reaves and Marc Scott Zicree. Directed by Marc Scott Zicree.\n\n\nAudio:\n\nCompression: MPEG Layer-3\nBitrate: 111kbps VBR\n\nVideo:\n\nResolution: 640x368\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 25.000fps\nCompression: XviD\n\nRuntime: 1hr 4mins 26sec","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3d04173455361e64f83a92c4b729faff54c0845","amp;dn":"Star.Trek.New.Voyages.S01E03.World.Enough.and.Time.WEBRIP.XviD-S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3d04173455361e64f83a92c4b729faff54c0845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,208,65,115,69,83,97,230,79,131,169,44,75,114,159,175,245,76,8,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
