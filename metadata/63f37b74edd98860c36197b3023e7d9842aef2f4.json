The bulk of the book focuses on the key role of the Iroquois in the struggle between the French and the English for control of North America before the American Revolution. The authors describe relations between the Seneca and the French, between the Mohawk and the Dutch and then the English, and between the various Iroquois nations and the American colonists and the British. They do an admirable job of explaining complex political interactions without trivializing or confusing the issues. The text is abundantly illustrated with full-color photographs and maps, and photo essays of Iroquois culture and history are interspersed throughout the book. The False Face Society, the role of the longhouse, the importance of wampum, the legacy of lacrosse, and Mohawk ironworkers are covered. Iroquois history and activities since the Civil War are briefly touched on in a few concluding pages. The up-to-date bibliography and index, as well as the illustrations, make this a useful library addition.-Lisa Mitten, University of Pittsburgh, PA\n\nCopyright 1993 Cahners Business Information, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f37b74edd98860c36197b3023e7d9842aef2f4","amp;dn":"The+American+Indians+-+Realm+of+the+Iroquois+%28History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f37b74edd98860c36197b3023e7d9842aef2f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,243,123,116,237,217,136,96,195,97,151,179,2,62,125,152,66,174,242,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
