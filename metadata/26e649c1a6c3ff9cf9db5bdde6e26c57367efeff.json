The River\n---\n\nWrong Way Up was probably the best collaboration between singer John Cale and songwriter/ambient wonderkid Brian Eno.  Two previous Cale releases had benefitted from Eno's touch, but this time Eno went back to more traditional songwriting and came up with one of the most original sounding albums in years.  Many may recognize the track &quot;Spinning Away&quot; from the soundtrack to &quot;The Beach,&quot; but the rest of the songs each have a catchy and distinct personality, appropriately very reminiscent of a tropical beach.\n\nSome albums beg to be listened to all the way through and are by the uniqueness in their sound timeless.  This is one album I'd take with me to a desert island.\n---\n\nFile Details: Encoded in FLAC (lossless) audio\nDownload FLAC Here: http://flac.sourceforge.net/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26e649c1a6c3ff9cf9db5bdde6e26c57367efeff","amp;dn":"Brian+Eno+%26+John+Cale+-+Wrong+Way+Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26e649c1a6c3ff9cf9db5bdde6e26c57367efeff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,230,73,193,166,195,255,156,249,219,91,221,230,226,108,87,54,126,254,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
