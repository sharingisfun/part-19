My My Love\n\nWax Wings, the fifth long-player from singer/songwriter Joshua Radin, offers up 11 melodic meditations on love and heartache that fall somewhere between the breezy, radio-ready emissions of Jack Johnson and the confessional, studious folk-pop of Josh Ritter. Engaging and articulate, the album's best moments like &quot;Beautiful Day,&quot; &quot;Lovely Tonight,&quot; &quot;In Her Eyes,&quot; and &quot;When We're Together&quot; echo past works like &quot;I'd Rather Be with You,&quot; &quot;Brand New Day,&quot; and &quot;Winter,&quot; and seem destined to follow the same path that those songs took into film and television, whether it's placement in an episode of Grey's Anatomy, Shameless, or the next Zach Braff film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7aa9f79f285f0cf7367f645fa77d5ef1391f407","amp;dn":"Joshua+Radin+-+Wax+Wings+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7aa9f79f285f0cf7367f645fa77d5ef1391f407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,170,159,121,242,133,240,207,115,103,246,69,250,119,213,239,19,145,244,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
