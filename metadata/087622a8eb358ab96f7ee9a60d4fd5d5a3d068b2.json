Hardboiled newshawk, Mitchell Brand, has the scoop on the crime of the century, the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre. Digging after every lead he can find, Brand wades knee-deep into a world of gangsters and G-men locked in a power struggle for control of the city. The bodies pile up and Brand worries that he's bitten off more than he can chew when his newsboys are added to the stack.\n\nA city magnate connected to the massacre commits suicide, and his daughter, reluctant socialite Emma Farnsworth, isn't willing to let dead men lie. After gunning for the mob, Emma and her lover, jazz player Eddie Collins, have to go underground to hide from the cops. In a deadly game of cat-and-mouse, Emma and Eddie will fight for their freedom and survival. If they're lucky, they might help a few others make it out alive when the Governor sends his army into the city's oldest neighborhoods with a single goal: clean house.\n\nIn devastated neighborhoods, citizens fight back and flee. Brand and his last remaining newsboy, Aiden Conroy, have to get the real story out on the airwaves. In scenes that take Brand back to the trenches of the Great War, he and Aiden must get the evidence the city needs to see the Governor for what he is. Through it all ride a corps of tramps on rusty bicycles, the mysterious Bicycle Men, and one of them has a message for Brand.\n\n\n&quot;[T]he very opening...blossoms with mystery as a slightly altered account of the Valentine Day Massacre unfolds. There is plenty in Gods of Chicago to keep me reading.&quot; - David Mark Brown, author of The Austin Job\n\n&quot;Set in a comfortably recognisable prohibition era Chicago with a unique Dieselpunk twist, Sikes serves up a slice of Noir that's completely compelling.&quot; - ZoÃƒÂ« Markham, author of Game Over: A Zanno Short Story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087622a8eb358ab96f7ee9a60d4fd5d5a3d068b2","amp;dn":"Gods+of+Chicago-+Omnibus+Edition+by+A+J+Sikes+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087622a8eb358ab96f7ee9a60d4fd5d5a3d068b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,118,34,168,235,53,138,185,111,126,233,166,13,79,213,213,163,208,104,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
