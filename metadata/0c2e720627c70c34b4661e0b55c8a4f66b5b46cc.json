Central decides Raj is the one to carry out a mission,and by showing him what will happen to the planet without intervention. Central convinces Raj to save the Civil Government from corruption and bandits. With the computers guidance, Raj proposes a battle plan and soon sets out to conquer the enemies, who would destroy Bellevue, while others plot against him from within. Central gives Raj advice from time to time by demonstrating for him in his mind's eye, what could happen if Raj makes the wrong strategic decision.\n\n\nDavid Drake -:\n\nThe General series began with The Forge in 1991 and has now reached nine volumes (with a tenth plotted). Using the life of the Byzantine general Belisarius as my matrix, I plotted a series of (originally) four books set in a world which has recovered to roughly the technological level of the 19th century after the galactic civilization collapsed.\nBecause the series (developed from my plots by Steve Stirling) was so successful, I did additional plots.\n\n\n01 The Forge\n02 The Hammer\n03 The Anvil\n04 The Steel\n05 The Sword\n06 The Chosen\n07 The Reformer\n08 The Tyrant\n09 The Heretic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2e720627c70c34b4661e0b55c8a4f66b5b46cc","amp;dn":"SM+Stirling+-+The+General+%28Raj+Whitehall%29+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2e720627c70c34b4661e0b55c8a4f66b5b46cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,46,114,6,39,199,12,52,180,102,30,11,85,200,164,246,107,91,70,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
