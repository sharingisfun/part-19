Issue 4 is the latest issue.\n\n\n\nThe first all-new original comic series created and written by Clive Barker is here! Julian Demond, captain of industry, has left behind everything to begin a walkabout -- he believes he's on a mission from God. While in the wasteland, he comes across a figure unlike any other, who calls himself Wick...and claims to be God. Their journey will span the globe, as neither man merely wants to make a mark on a world, but a scar. Clive Barker, with internationally acclaimed artist Haemi Jang (HELLRAISER: THE ROAD BELOW), come together to create the next legendary work in the canon of one of the great writers of our era.
