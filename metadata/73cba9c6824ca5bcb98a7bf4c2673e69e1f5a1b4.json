These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead &quot;the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world.&quot;[6] They were ranked 55th in the issue The Greatest Artists of all Time by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Terrapin: Hartford '77 2009\n\n\nTo Terrapin: Hartford '77 is a live album by the American rock band the Grateful Dead.
