It covers all aspects of petrology, including not only the principles of petrology but also applications to the origin, composition, and field relationships of rocks. Although petrology is commonly taught in the junior year, this book is a useful resource for graduate students as well.\n\nAbout the Author\nPrior to joining the American University of Sharjah (AUS) as Vice Provost for Research and Graduate Studies and Professor of Environmental Sciences, Dr. Gautam Sen was Associate Dean of Research at Florida International University (FIU). At FIU, he also served as Chair of the Department of Earth Sciences (currently Earth and Environment), and was the recipient of research awards and the prestigious Excellence in Service Award. He is presently on a leave-of-absence from FIU, where he is a tenured Full Professor.\nProfessor Sen has written/edited books and published papers in highly ranked journals, including Science and Nature. One of his papers was chosen to be the cover article in Science. Dr. Sen has served on international committees, chaired conferences, given numerous lectures and chaired technical conferences worldwide. He has supervised four doctoral dissertations, four post-doctoral fellows, and served on many more doctoral and master's committees. He has supervised many graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.\nProfessor Sen received his PhD in Geosciences from the University of Texas at Dallas, USA, and was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California at Los Angeles.\n\nCONTENTS\n1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . 1\n2 Introduction to Igneous Rocks . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3 Phase Relations in Simple Systems: Key to Magma Generation,\nCrystallization, and Mixing . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 51\n4 Phase Relationships in Ternary Systems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 79\n5 Magma Formation and Segregation . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . 99\n6 Igneous Rock Series: Basalt Magma Evolution . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 119\n7 Basalt Magma Generation: Perspectives from Experimental Petrology . . . . . 151\n8 Basaltic Magmatism at Mid-Oceanic Ridges and Hawaiian Hot Spot . . . . . . . 163\n9 Large Igneous Provinces: Deccan Traps and Columbia River Basalts . . . . . . 189\n10 Subduction Zone Magmas . . . . . . . .. . . . 209\n11 Alkaline and Ultra-Alkaline Rocks, Carbonatites, and Kimberlites . . . . . . . . 243\n12 Anorthosites and Komatiites . . . . . . . . . 261\n13 Sediments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 277\n14 Sedimentary Rocks . . . . . . . . . . 299\n15 Metamorphism and Metamorphic Rocks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 311\n16 Metamorphic Facies, Reactions, and PÃ¢â‚¬â€œTÃ¢â‚¬â€œt Paths . . . . . . . . . . . . . 325\nAppendix A: A Brief Introduction to Isotope Geochemistry . . . .. . . . . 351\nAppendix B: Simplified CIPW Norm Calculation . . . . . . . . . . . . . 357\nReferences . . . . . . . . . . . 359","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a7be9146e7dd704d8026a65d97814d0bd2344fd","amp;dn":"Petrology+-+Principles+and+Practice+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a7be9146e7dd704d8026a65d97814d0bd2344fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,123,233,20,110,125,215,4,216,2,106,101,217,120,20,208,189,35,68,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
