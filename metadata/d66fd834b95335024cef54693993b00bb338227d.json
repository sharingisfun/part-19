If after testing it you see that you like it and need this program, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d66fd834b95335024cef54693993b00bb338227d","amp;dn":"nLite+1.4.9.1+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d66fd834b95335024cef54693993b00bb338227d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,111,216,52,185,83,53,2,76,239,84,105,57,147,176,11,179,56,34,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
