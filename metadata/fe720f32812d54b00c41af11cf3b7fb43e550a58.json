Detective 'Jughead' Ryan  \n\nJosh Baker (Roberts) meets a beautiful woman, Cheryl (Janine Turner), on the street one afternoon, only to see her faint and be carted off to the hospital in an ambulance. When Baker tries to find Cheryl at the hospital, he realizes she was never admitted. With the help of an unconvinced New York City police lieutenant (James Earl Jones), Baker attempts to expose trafficking conspiracy without implicating himself in Cheryl's disappearance.\n\nThe Ambulance has a sort of freewheeling, madcap vibe about it, and, despite some stretches of inactivity, the movie is funny and thrilling. The ambulance becomes quite the villain, smashing through walls, careening down narrow alleys and stalking Baker throughout Manhattan. I half expected it to turn up reflected in the bathroom mirror. Its ridiculous presence at nearly every turn is both hilarious and unnerving.\n\nWhile CohenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dialogue is occasionally a tad tepid, his plotting is unbelievably tight. He introduces characters in the natural flow of the story, never worrying late additions may be hostile to the audience.\n\nThe film has a bunch of fantastic performances but the two most important are Eric Roberts (as the lead) and Megan Gallagher (as his reluctant sidekick). Roberts maintains energy and enthusiasm throughoutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½every moment heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on screen, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s captivating. Even with a terrible haircut.\n\nHalf GallagherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance is unspoken, just her expressions changing. She has great chemistry with Roberts.\n\nRed Buttons has a nice partÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½excellent chemistry between him and Roberts. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too bad there wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a sequel, given he gets along with Gallagher well too.\n\nJames Earl Jones also has a good part. He has a lot of fun. The next supporting tier is strong too. Janine Turner, Eric Braeden, Richard Bright, all good. Stan Lee has a nice cameo for realismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sake (Roberts works at Marvel Comics).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe720f32812d54b00c41af11cf3b7fb43e550a58","amp;dn":"The+Ambulance+%5B1990%5D+Eric+Roberts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe720f32812d54b00c41af11cf3b7fb43e550a58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,114,15,50,129,45,84,176,12,65,175,17,207,59,127,180,62,85,10,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
