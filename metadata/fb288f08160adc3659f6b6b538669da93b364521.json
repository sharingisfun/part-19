Handmade is hip, creativity is what the market wants, and there are many profitable sales opportunities that didn't exist a few short years ago. For crafters who have more confidence running a sewing machine than setting up a Web site, The Handmade Marketplace breaks down and makes sense of the global possibilities for marketing and selling crafts.\n\nFirst, determine the right price for every item Ã¢â‚¬â€ not too expensive and definitely not too cheap. Whether the product is beaded jewelry or felted slippers, illustrations or tote bags, author Kari Chapin helps crafters determine cost of goods, market competition, and the pros and cons of wholesale and retail sales. If the price is right, customers will buy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb288f08160adc3659f6b6b538669da93b364521","amp;dn":"The+Handmade+Marketplace%3A+How+to+Sell+Your+Crafts+Locally%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb288f08160adc3659f6b6b538669da93b364521","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,40,143,8,22,10,220,54,89,246,182,181,56,102,157,169,59,54,69,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
