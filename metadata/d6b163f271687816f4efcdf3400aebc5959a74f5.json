How does a successful show that's been on the air for years suddenly become a hit in its fifth and sixth season? Have you ever wondered why you identify so strongly with Barney despite the fact that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s such a douche? Or why your life story doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make sense until you know the endingÃ¢â‚¬â€or at least, the middle? Or where the Bro Code came from and why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so powerful? Or why youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d sooner miss the hottest date in your life than have to live in New Jersey?\nOf course you have, or if you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll clearly remember from now on that you have. How I Met Your Mother and Philosophy answers all these questions and a whole lot more, including one or two that even you may not have thought of.\nTwenty of the awesome-est philosophers ever congregated in one bar have come together to quaff a few drinksÃ¢â‚¬â€and to analyze this most awesomely philosophical of sit-coms. They poke, prod, and sniff at such momentous matters as the metaphysics of possimpible worlds, the misdeeds of Goliath National Bank, the ontology of waiting to get slapped, the epistemology of sexual attraction, why the Platinum Rule is to never love thy neighbor, the authenticity of censoring yourself, the ethics of doing bad things with partly good intentions, why future TedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opinions matter to present-day Ted, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irrational to wait for the Slutty Pumpkin, and why Canadians have that strange Canadian slant on things.\nThis book shows that viewers of How I Met Your Mother and Philosophy know that philosophy is much more than a song and dance routine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6b163f271687816f4efcdf3400aebc5959a74f5","amp;dn":"How+I+Met+Your+Mother+and+Philosophy+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6b163f271687816f4efcdf3400aebc5959a74f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,177,99,242,113,104,120,22,244,239,205,243,64,10,235,197,149,154,116,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
