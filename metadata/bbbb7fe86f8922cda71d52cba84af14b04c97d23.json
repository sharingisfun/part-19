There are tons of pre made ones so that you dont have to set all the voice commands up and stuff, but there are gonna be some missing games in there so you will have to start from scratch once and a while, FSX is not in there though, but i just use the FS2004 pre made one to play with FSX, almost all commands are same but if they dont have a command like lets say...Fuel Dump then just add it real quick.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbbb7fe86f8922cda71d52cba84af14b04c97d23","amp;dn":"Voice+Buddy+V3+%28FS2004%2C+FSX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbbb7fe86f8922cda71d52cba84af14b04c97d23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,187,127,232,111,137,34,205,167,29,82,203,168,74,241,75,4,201,125,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
