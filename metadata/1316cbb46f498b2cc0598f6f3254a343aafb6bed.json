The sound of The Moving Sidewalks has nothing to do with ZZ Top - it's typical '60s psychedelic. The band performed as opening act for The Doors and Jimi Hendrix. In 2013 they did some reunion stage acts - not only with their own old songs from their sole album 'Flash' but also as a tribute to Jimi Hendrix and fellow Texas rock-legend Roky Erickson.\n\n\ntracklist:\n\n(01) Flashback                 \n(02) Scoun Da Be               \n(03) You Make Me Shake         \n(04) You Don't Know The Life   \n(05) Pluto - Sept. 31st        \n(06) No Good To Cry            \n(07) Crimson Witch             \n(08) Joe Blues                 \n(09) Eclipse                   \n(10) Reclipse                  \n(11) 99th Floor                \n(12) What Ar You Doing To Do   \n(13) I Want To Hold Your Hand  \n(14) Never Me                  \n(15) Every Night A New Surprise\n\nlineup:\n\nBilly Gibbons - guitar, vocals\nTom Moore - keyboards\nDon Summers - bass\nDan Mitchell - drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1316cbb46f498b2cc0598f6f3254a343aafb6bed","amp;dn":"The+Moving+Sidewalks+-+Flash+%281969%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1316cbb46f498b2cc0598f6f3254a343aafb6bed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,22,203,180,111,73,139,44,192,89,143,111,50,84,163,67,170,251,107,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
