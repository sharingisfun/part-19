Gilboy and Dr Eric Heginbotham\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThis book offers an empirical comparison of Chinese and Indian international strategic behavior. It is the first study of its kind, filling an important gap in the literature on rising Indian and Chinese power and American interests in Asia. \n\nThe book creates a framework for the systematic and objective assessment of Chinese and Indian strategic behavior in four areas: (1) strategic culture; (2) foreign policy and use of force; (3) military modernization (including defense spending, military doctrine, and force modernization); and (4) economic strategies (including international trade and energy competition). The utility of democratic peace theory in predicting Chinese and Indian behavior is also examined. The findings challenge many assumptions underpinning western expectations of China and India.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aea359dab5d82e75b99c98093de736382f559737","amp;dn":"Chinese+and+Indian+Strategic+Behavior%3A+Growing+Power+and+Alarm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aea359dab5d82e75b99c98093de736382f559737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,163,89,218,181,216,46,117,185,156,152,9,61,231,54,56,47,85,151,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
