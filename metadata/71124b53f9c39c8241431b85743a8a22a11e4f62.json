Gyllenhaal stars as Jimmy Livingston, a teenager with an immune system deficiency who has spent his entire life living in a plastic bubble under the doting, overprotective care of his mother (Swoosie Kurtz). Jimmy is in love with his next-door neighbor Chloe (Marley Shelton), so when he learns that she has left for Niagara Falls in order to be married, he's devastated. He quickly assembles a portable &quot;bubble suit&quot; and sets out on a 2,755.8-mile odyssey in order to stop her and proclaim his affection. Along the way, Jimmy experiences a number of adventures, including encounters with freaks, bikers, rock stars, and a cult. Bubble Boy is a comic riff on the classic TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble (1976), which starred a young John Travolta.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71124b53f9c39c8241431b85743a8a22a11e4f62","amp;dn":"Bubble+Boy%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71124b53f9c39c8241431b85743a8a22a11e4f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,18,75,83,249,195,156,130,65,67,27,133,116,58,138,34,161,30,79,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
