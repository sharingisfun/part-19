If you do this, please post a comment. I would be very grateful.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6096c5daebd454dec2245317b94c890b47551d1","amp;dn":"Toshtsumoto+-+Experimental+films+and+early+documentaries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6096c5daebd454dec2245317b94c890b47551d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,9,108,93,174,189,69,77,236,34,69,49,123,148,200,144,180,117,81,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
