By 1959, McNally and Pender were working together as a duet; later in the year, Jackson joined as the lead vocalist. After drummer Norman McGarry left the Searchers he was replaced by Chris Crummy, who quickly renamed himself Chris Curtis. Other changes were in the works as Jackson built and learned to play a customized bass guitar. Learning his new job on the four-stringed instrument proved too difficult to permit him to continue singing lead, and McNally and Pender brought in a fifth member, Johnny Sandon (born Billy Beck). Johnny Sandon &amp; the Searchers lasted from 1960 through February of 1962, and were extremely popular on the dance hall and club circuit in Liverpool. Sandon cut out for a career on his own, with another band called the Remo Four in early 1962.\n\nMeanwhile, the Searchers, now a quartet with Jackson once again lead singer, became one of the top acts on the Liverpool band scene, playing textured renditions of American R&amp;B, rock &amp; roll, country, soul, and rockabilly. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jifixqr5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jifixqr5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nWhile this anthology does collectors a service by gathering many of the group's rarest recordings in one place, you've really got to be a hard-bitten fanatic to find this import worthwhile. This 24-song compilation includes the group's German versions of hits like &quot;Sugar And Spice&quot; and &quot;Goodbye My Love,&quot; as well as their (poorly accented) French renditions of &quot;Don't Throw Your Love Away&quot; and &quot;Sugar And Spice&quot; (again). A half-dozen other German and French re-recordings of 1963-64 B-sides and album tracks, some quite obscure even in their original English versions, are included as well. As you might expect, the group simply rerecorded their vocals over the original backing tracks for the Continental market, which most likely preferred the English versions anyway. The CD also includes drummer Chris Curtis' rare and forgettable 1966 single, as well as a clumsy medley of their greatest hits and ten dreadful, undocumented tunes that date from well after their mid-'60s heyday. Fans looking for decent rare Searchers should seek out the Play The System LP, which compiles '60s B-sides and rarities of considerably higher quality.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
