In this course, award-winning photographer Kevin Steele shares insights on documenting the intensity of soccer action. Operating as if he were on a commercial assignment, Kevin takes you on set and behind the scenes. He'll show how to scout a location, coordinate the athletes, plan your gear, work with both natural light and studio strobes, and make shooting decisions on the spur of the moment.
