And that is exactly what happened.\n\nReview by Andrew Farach-Colton (Barnes &amp; Noble)\nFirst issued in 1976, Music of the Gothic Era, by David Munrow and the Early Music Consort of London, wasn't the first recording to present works by LÃƒÂ©onin, Perotin, Adam de la Halle, and Machaut. But the performances were so exquisite and ardent that it opened up the world of early music for many music lovers, and it marked, in part, the beginning of an explosion of interest in that world.\n\nMunrow's recordings are still prized today, and even though scholarship in early music performance practice has advanced considerably over the past 25 years, few performers had the ability to make this very ancient music come so vividly to life. Sadly, Munrow died when he was only 33 (the same year this set was released), so his recorded legacy is especially important.\n\nThe Art of Courtly Love and The Art of the Netherlands should be in any serious collection, but Music of the Gothic Era may be the most beguiling of all his records. The organa of LÃƒÂ©onin and Perotin have an otherworldly radiance, and Munrow and his singers bring expressive elegance to the gnarliest of the Ars nova motets. Indeed, every work conveys an exhilarating sense of freshness and discovery. The recording still sounds amazing, too, although, regrettably, we must do without the beautiful artwork that adorned the box and booklet of the original LP edition. An essential set.\n\nFull tracklist: http://www.discogs.com/Early-Music-Consort-Of-London-David-Munrow-Music-Of-The-Gothic-Era-Musik-Der-Gotik-Musique-Du-Moyen-/release/1942953","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbc461c3d8521aeb2ac984895bd66d095a9b15eb","amp;dn":"David+Munrow+-+Music+of+the+Gothic+Era+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbc461c3d8521aeb2ac984895bd66d095a9b15eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,196,97,195,216,82,26,235,42,201,132,137,91,214,109,9,90,155,21,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
