Buoyed by a receptive audience and always in the mood to play to the best of their abilities, the musicians outdo themselves throughout the set. Among the highlights are lengthy explorations of &quot;How High the Moon&quot; (which is centered around Brown's tasty solo) and Peterson's &quot;The Music Box Suite,&quot; cooking interpretations of a pair of the late Clifford Brown's best-known compositions (&quot;Joy Spring&quot; and &quot;Daahoud&quot;), and a pair of little-known originals by Ellis (including a lovely solo ballad, &quot;Patricia,&quot; and the blistering &quot;Pogo&quot;). Add it all up and any fan of Oscar Peterson will want to add this Just a Memory CD to his or her collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d889aeb98c7ab3aaca4fb9ef051676adaccfff","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+Trio+-+Vancouver%2C+1958+%5B+mp3%40320+%5D+-+CAPTAiN_24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d889aeb98c7ab3aaca4fb9ef051676adaccfff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,216,137,174,185,140,122,179,170,202,79,185,239,5,22,118,173,172,207,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
