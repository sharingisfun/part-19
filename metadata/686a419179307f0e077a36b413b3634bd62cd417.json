Airy pop melodies collide with abstract, sometimes dissonant elements that smack of druggy improvisation. Heavy baroque orchestration engages in dominance/submission struggles with samples, found voices, Velvet Underground guitars, and cocktail crooning from some nightclub of the damned. Two striking uptempo numbers break the languid brooding. &quot;White Jazz&quot; weds a truculently abrasive orchestra meltdown with a nihilistic punkish rant, as if John Cale's brain had been transplanted into Stooges-era Iggy Pop's body.
