It is a wonderful movie with excellent acting with Richard Dreyfuss as the all dominating force. Hugo Weaving shows why he is one of the worlds greatest character actors with his portrayal as the very loving and slightly lazy dentist. The story is really not important as it is the acting that really puts this film on the map. I don't mean this in a negative way, mind you!The plot is simply not that important once you hear the rusty voice of Dreyfuss doing a marvelous Spanish accent. The same goes for Weaving.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: The old man who read love stories.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,441,786,722 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:44:39\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 1\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x272 (AR: 2.353)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1381 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.317 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223832/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223832/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nRolf de Heer - The Old Man Who Read Love Stories (2001)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a75a58573e352b658bc79b10013dbcf2fc4eaf73","amp;dn":"Rolf+de+Heer+-+The+Old+Man+Who+Read+Love+Stories+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a75a58573e352b658bc79b10013dbcf2fc4eaf73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,90,88,87,62,53,43,101,139,199,155,16,1,61,188,242,252,78,175,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
