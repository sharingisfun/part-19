Although lighter and more melodramatic in tone than its predecessor, Affinity, this hypnotic suspense novel is awash with all manner of gloomy Dickensian leitmotifs: pickpockets, orphans, grim prisons, lunatic asylums, &quot;laughing villains,&quot; and, of course, &quot;stolen fortunes and girls made out to be mad.&quot; Divided into three parts, the tale is narrated by two orphaned girls whose lives are inextricably linked. Waters's penchant for byzantine plotting can get a bit exhausting, but even at its densest moments--and remember, this is smoggy London circa 1862--it remains mesmerizing. A damning critique of Victorian moral and sexual hypocrisy, a gripping melodrama, and a love story to boot, this book ingeniously reworks some truly classic themes.\n\nContains both .azw and .mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f0edb7307a6db610f0cd424afb1cbbb6d5e161","amp;dn":"Fingersmith+-+Sarah+Waters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f0edb7307a6db610f0cd424afb1cbbb6d5e161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,240,237,183,48,122,109,182,16,240,205,66,74,251,28,187,182,213,225,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
