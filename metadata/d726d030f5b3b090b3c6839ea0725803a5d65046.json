The full game is included here along with the expansion, Beyond the Dark Portal. I've tested this with a Nexus 7 2012 and it runs very smoothly, but performance can vary with every Android device. This is an awesome classic to have for a handheld game, and I wanted to upload this since it was a HUGE pain to get a hold of myself. Anyways, enjoy this classic strategy title :)\n\n\n=== Instructions ===\n\n1.) Copy the &quot;wargus_warcraft_2_1.apk&quot; anywhere on your device.\n2.) Use an APK installer app to install the Wargus apk.\n3.) Unzip the contents of &quot;TidesOfDarkness-Wargus-Android.zip&quot; to the home directory of your device.\n4.) Start up Wargus and enjoy. If Wargus cannot find the &quot;Wargus-Android&quot; folder, you can browse to it.\n\n**To play the expansion, Unzip the &quot;BeyondTheDarkPortalWargus-Android.zip&quot; to your device instead of the other one.**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d726d030f5b3b090b3c6839ea0725803a5d65046","amp;dn":"Wargus+-+Warcraft+2+for+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d726d030f5b3b090b3c6839ea0725803a5d65046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,38,208,48,245,179,176,144,179,198,131,158,160,114,88,3,165,214,80,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
