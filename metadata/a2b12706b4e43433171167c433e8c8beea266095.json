Drawn from memos, contemporaneous meeting notes, emails and in-depth interviews with the central players, The Price of Politics addresses the key issue of the presidential and congressional campaigns: the condition of the American economy and how and why we got there. Providing verbatim, day-by-day, even hour-by-hour accounts, the book shows what really happened, what drove the debates, negotiations and struggles that define, and will continue to define, the American future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b12706b4e43433171167c433e8c8beea266095","amp;dn":"Bob+Woodward+-+The+Price+of+Politics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b12706b4e43433171167c433e8c8beea266095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,177,39,6,180,228,52,51,23,17,103,196,51,232,200,190,234,38,96,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
