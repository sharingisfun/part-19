In between sharing sumptuous meals and fine wine with Alexandre at some of Paris' finest eateries, Capucine struggles to win the respect of her new squad of detectives and crack both the case and the guarded secrets of the restaurant staff.\n\nCrime Fraiche #2\nTaking a break from the hustle and bustle of Paris, French detective Capucine LeTellier and her portly food critic husband, Alexandre, visit Capucine's family's manor home in Normandy. Arriving at the height of the pheasant hunting season, idyllic picnic lunches and mushrooming trips in the forest are interrupted by a series of hunting accidents that claim the lives of several employees from the local cattle ranch, famed for its exquisite beef. Suspecting foul play, Capucine delves into local affairs only to find her investigation stymied by the local police force. And as the case unravels, Capucine and Alexandre uncover romantic intrigues gone awry and dangerous, deadly resentments...\n\nKiller Critique #3\nNow a seasoned member of the Paris Police Judiciaire, the ever fashionable and whip smart Commissaire Capucine Le Tellier is finding murder to be more than just the specialite du jour...When the senior food critic for Le Figaro is found face-first in a plate of Ravioles d'horand, there seem to be as many suspects as there are restaurants in the City of Light. Yet Capucine feels she'll solve the case quicker than it takes to serve up an omelette aux fines herbs. Un problem, murders of food critics have become an epidemic. As the bodies pile up, un, deux, trois, so do the suspects, including a sexy starlet, an award-winning novelist, and a smorgasbord of aggravated chefs. While Capucine struggles to zero in on the murderer's tastes, she is confronted with a false dilemma: file and forget the case, leaving restaurant critics across France vulnerable to a killer's episodic cravings, or use her husband, Alexander, himself a famous food journalist, as irresistible bait.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23c2829ff535157f2ab47de8120c3d073bca916f","amp;dn":"Capucine+Culinary+Mystery+series+-+Alexander+Campion+%283+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23c2829ff535157f2ab47de8120c3d073bca916f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,194,130,159,245,53,21,127,42,180,125,232,18,12,61,7,59,202,145,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
