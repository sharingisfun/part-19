Very similar to Modern Magick, I don&amp;#039;t know wich manual inspired wich, but they&amp;#039;re almost identic. Some topics: QBL, Banishing Rituals, Meditations, Making of Talismans, among other things.\n\nHope it helps you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b36bcac24804b1a2a2fdbbd71cd10a4c514e803","amp;dn":"Techniques+Of+High+Magic+By+Francis+King+and+Stephen+Skinner+A+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b36bcac24804b1a2a2fdbbd71cd10a4c514e803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,54,188,172,36,128,75,26,42,47,219,189,113,205,16,164,197,20,232,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
