I. Kharisov et al. (CRC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4665-8089-3\r\n\r\nThe CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Nanotechnology sets the standard against which all other references of this nature are measured. As such, it is a major resource for both skilled professionals and novices to nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe book examines the design, application, and utilization of devices, techniques, and technologies critical to research at the atomic, molecular, and macromolecular levels ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers.\r\n\r\nMore than three dozen specific topics are examined, including nanomaterials, nanocatalysts, nanoceramics, nanocrystals, carbon nanotubes, drug delivery, nanopolymers, nanoparticles, nanocoatings, and nanomedicine. The material is presented in a concise manner and has been updated to reflect the latest applications and research findings.\r\n\r\nEntries are organized alphabetically, making information easy to find. While coverage is comprehensive, each topic is presented concisely with a wealth of illustrative material and an accompanying eBook providing full-color figures and images","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee804ce11ea76889b864c7806d6bad3732f51d06","amp;dn":"CRC+Concise+Encyclopedia+of+Nanotechnology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee804ce11ea76889b864c7806d6bad3732f51d06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,128,76,225,30,167,104,137,184,100,199,128,109,107,173,55,50,245,29,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
