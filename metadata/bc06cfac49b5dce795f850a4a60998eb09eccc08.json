The band could have been called Diamond Dusk just as well, as their story ended later that year.\nIf you liked Diamond Dawn, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll probably like Art Nation too. \nThere hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been a drastic change in the music style even though some of the songwriters may have changed. \nArt Nation still play melodic, hook-driven rock with big keys, guitars and vocals and they do it well. \nÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½RevolutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ might not actually offer anything revolutionary to the melodic rock genre, but I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better than Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½OverdriveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and most probably one of the best Scandi-AOR albums youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear this year.\n\nTracks:\n1. Need You To Understand\n2. 3000 Beats\n3. I want Out\n4. Number One\n5. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Wait For Salvation\n6. All The Way\n7. Start A Fire\n8. Moving On\n9. Here I Am\n10. Look To The Sky\n11. Wage War Against The World\n12.
