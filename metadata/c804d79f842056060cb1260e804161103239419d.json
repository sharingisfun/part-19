With top quality modelling, Advanced Activscript coding, exacting attention to detail throughout and 15 scenarios for a variety of routes, this is haulage heaven!\n\nThe Class 20 is an iconic diesel locomotive built in the UK and still giving sterling service all over the network. It's accompanied here by the unique RHTT (Rail Head Treatment Train) used to clear the infamous Ã¢â‚¬Å“leaves on the lineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ during the leaf fall season and the ultra-strong FNA Nuclear Flask wagons that are used to transport nuclear materials around the UK.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Joining the other Advanced locomotives in our range, the Class 20 Advanced Collection employs extensive ActivScript technology to provide many realistic and accurate operations which can be found only in Just Trains add-ons.\n\nThe Advanced range provides immersive features such as advanced operating controls, realistic systems and the distinctive 'chopper' sounds of the Class 20 Advanced recorded from the real locomotive.ActivTrain and ActivWagon smart coding technology allows the Class 20 Advanced engine to control the water spraying and sound effects of the RHTT and is also employed by the FNA and RHTT to provide an authentic red flashing tail lamp, engine headcode numbers and letters, and the FNA flasks loaded/unloaded condition! \n\n15 CLASS 20 ADVANCED LIVERIES\n\nBritish Rail Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Blue\nBritish Rail Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Green\nBritish Rail Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Headcode box \nBritish Rail Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Weathered \nDRS (Direct Rail Services)\nDRS (Direct Rail Services) Compass (20301-20305)\nDRS (Direct Rail Services) Compass (20306-20315)\nDRS - Refurbished\nDRS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Refurbished &amp; weathered\nGBRF (GB Rail freight) 20901\nGBRF (GB Rail freight) 20905\nHunslet-Barclay \nHNRC (Harry Needle Railroad Company)\nLafarge Cement\nRailfreight\n\nCLASS 20 ADVANCED COLLECTION FEATURES\n \nWe have tried to replicate as far as possible the typical operations of the real Class 20. Fully replicating all the systems in Train Simulator is simply not possible, but we have added features designed to give you a genuine feeling of how the real locomotive is operated.\n\nDynamic exhaust - dense smoke at start-up, colour and density varies with engine load and temperature\nExternal rain effects on glass which are cleared by wiper operation\nVariable-speed, independent left and right rain-clearing wipers which work with TS2014 rain effects\nWorking cab and instrument lights\nQuick Drive compatible\nTS2104 lens flare on HID light-equipped locomotives\nAmmeter tracks RPM as well as throttle position\nBraking too hard for extended periods will lead to an audible wheel flat forming\nIndividual horn tones\nDriverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key (must be inserted before reverser can be moved)\nOperating AWS isolation (must be set to On to allow locomotive to be driven)\nAWS/DSD self-test and warning buzzer and bell\nEnhanced cab detail and texturing\nCustom couplings\nCustom driver model\nCustom bogie and coupling sounds\nForward and reverse driving positions\nHeadcode discs and red lamps controlled by lighting switches above side windows\nSprings/suspension\nElectrical and hose connections \nAppropriate period lights \nHeadcode boxes \nDisc headcodes \n3D access cover handles\nRotating roof ventilation fan \nAuthentic and highly detailed cab \nCustom physics \n\nADVANCED FEATURES IN DETAIL\n\nOperational battery isolating switch\n\nThis isolates and connects the battery from the rest of the locomotive and must be operated before running the locomotive.\n\nAWS control \n\nThis allows the operation or isolation of the AWS system and must be set to ON (Lever UP) to allow the brakes to release and allow power to flow before the locomotive can be driven. When it is set to ON you must cancel the warning buzzer and bell with the AWS cancel button or [Q] key.\n\n\nLIGHT CONTROL PANELS\n\nOne located above both the left and right side cab windows - control the operation of the cab and instrument lights as well as the headcode discs and external lights on appropriate models:\n\nLeft hand side top marker light switch\nCentre top marker light switch\nRight-hand side top marker light switch\nCab interior light switch\nInstruments light switch\nRight-hand side bottom marker light switch\nCentre bottom marker light switch\nLeft-hand side bottom marker light switch\nÃ¢â‚¬Æ’\nFORWARD DRIVING POSITION FEATURES\n\nLocomotive brake controller\nTrain brake controller\nHorn operating lever\nFault warning light\nWheelslip warning light \n'Engine stopped' warning light\nCombined vacuum train pipe and loco vacuum chamber pressure gauge \nMain reservoir pressure gauge\nCombined Bogie 1 and Bogie 2 brake cylinder pressure gauge\nCombined main reservoir M.R. pipe and M.R. supply pressure gauges\nAmmeter\nMaster key (drag to insert)\nThrottle/power handle\nFour- position reverser lever - OFF/Reverse/Engine only/Forward\nAWS warning reset button\nSpeedometer\nAWS sunflower\nLeft side windscreen wiper variable speed wiper control\nRight side windscreen wiper variable speed wiper control\nEngine handbrake.

The exterior of the wagon does not change when the wagon is loaded or unloaded as the fuel flask is securely stored inside the rectangular box in the middle of the wagon. The only giveaway as to whether a load is being carried is the presence of hazard warning diamonds on the side of the wagon. It is possible to have the FNA loaded or unloaded and the hazard diamonds shown when appropriate.\n\nWagon configurations\n\nBoth versions are supplied in clean, lightly weathered and heavily weathered versions\nLoaded (shows hazard diamonds) \nUnloaded (no hazard diamonds)\nActivWagon smart coding adds a flashing red tail lamp\n\nFEA-F RHTT (RAIL HEAD TREATMENT TRAIN)\n\nThe Rail Head Treatment Train is a specialist rake of FEA-F wagons with various modules made up of a generator pack, water tanks and a Sandite dispenser. These wagons are used during the leaf fall season in the UK to spray very high pressure water jets onto the rails to clear the slippery leaf mulch which is the cause of dangerous grip and braking issues. Included are highly detailed sets of the RHTT in different configurations and states of weathering from shiny and new to very dirty! They are all configured to take advantage of the ActivWagon smart-coded flashing red tail lamp.\n\nFEA-F RHTT configurations\n\nAll supplied in clean, lightly weathered and heavily weathered versions\nWater - Water - Water\nWater - Water - Sandite \nWater - Generator - Water \nWater - Generator - Sandite\nActivWagon smart coding adds a flashing red tail lamp\nNight lighting effect from Generator fluorescent tubes\n\n15 SCENARIOS\n\nPlease note that not all these routes are included in Train Simulator by default and are not supplied with this product. You can purchase some of them from the Just Trains website and some from the STEAM store.\n\n\nGREAT WESTERN MAINLINE (OXFORD-PADDINGTON ROUTE)\n\nJT 20 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Southern Tour\nHead a double-header Class 20 special on its return from a tour south of the Thames.\n\nJT 20 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Morning Spray\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the end of October and the leaves are starting to fall from the trees.
