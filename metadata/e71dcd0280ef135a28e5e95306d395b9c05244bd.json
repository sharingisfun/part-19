If this hearsay turns out to be true, take consolation in the fact that the live 2-CD ONE MORE CAR, ONE MORE RIDER serves as a nifty souvenir from that particular string of shows. Benefiting from a crystal clear sound mix and a stellar back-up group whose members include keyboardists David Sancious and Billy Preston, Slowhand delivers a heavy mix of his most recent forays into contemporary adult pop and certain classic rock warhorses that would have benefited from early retirement.\n\nOne result is Clapton doing a fine job wielding an acoustic guitar and shifting gears from laying into the Big Bill Broonzy stomper &quot;Key To The Highway&quot; to making like Gilberto Gil on the bossa-nova flavored instrumental &quot;Reptile.&quot;\n\nAlthough the version of &quot;Badge&quot; included here shines and a different arrangement of &quot;Cocaine&quot; breathes some life into this Clapton standard, the umpteenth version of &quot;Layla&quot; would have been better substituted by a more obscure cut off the same album. Otherwise, Clapton's playing remains top-notch and spurs hopes that his days on the road haven't come to an end.\n\n\n\nPersonnel: Eric Clapton (vocals, guitar); David Sancious (guitar, keyboards); Andy Fairweather Low (guitar, background vocals); Greg Phillinganes, Billy Preston (Hammond B-3 organ, keyboards); Nathan East (bass, background vocals); Steve Gadd (drums).\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1\n\n01.
