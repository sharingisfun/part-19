They also wrote a book about writing (THE EVERYTHING GUIDE TO WRITING A NOVEL) as well as hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. Somewhere along the way, they decided to write mysteries and since then, they have been hooked on that genre. \n\nA Timely Vision: Meet Dae O'Donnell, a woman with a gift for finding lost things-and the stories behind lost lives...\n\nDae O'Donnell is the mayor of Duck, North Carolina-and the person everyone turns to when they've lost something. One touch and Dae can find it, and missing pieces seem to find their way to her, whether she wants them to or not.\n\nWhen Miss Mildred asks Dae to find her missing watch, Dae finds herself looking for more than mislaid jewelry-she must prove the town matriarch isn't a cold-blooded killer.\n\nA Touch of Gold: Long before he became curator of the Duck Historical Museum, Max Caudle discovered its greatest treasure-a wooden chest full of gold. But a thief with his eye on the gold fires a cannonball into the museum, destroying the building-and killing Max.\n\nInjured in the explosion, Dae finds her abilities have been amplified, overwhelming her with intense visions every time she touches an object. Now if ex-FBI agent-and burgeoning beau-Kevin Brickman can help Dae decipher her visions, she just might be able to stop the modern-day buccaneer from killing again.\n\nA Spirited Gift: &quot;Few amateur sleuths are as charming.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Patricia Sprinkle\nAs the mayor of Duck, North Carolina, Dae is playing host to twenty North Carolina elected officials attending her first Mayors' Conference Weekend at the Blue Whale Inn. When the body of Mayor Sandi Foxx is discovered the morning after a severe storm, Dae receives a vision through the mayor's ring; that there's a killer among the guests who's as deadly as any hurricane.\n\nA Haunting Dream: When her boyfriend KevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-fiancÃƒÂ©e Ann arrives in Duck looking for a second chance, Dae suddenly finds herself facing certain heartache. And while her romantic life is in shambles, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even more concerned by the sudden change in her gift. After touching a medallion owned by a local named Chuck Sparks, Dae is shocked when her vision reveals his murderÃ¢â‚¬â€and a cry for help.\n\nDae doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what to make of the dead manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plea to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Help her,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ until she has another vision about a kidnapped girlÃ¢â‚¬â€ChuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, Betsy. With a child missing, the FBI steps in to take over the case. But Dae canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ignore her visions of Betsy, or the fact that KevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s psychic ex-fiancÃƒÂ©e might be the only person who can help find herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nA Finder's Fee: Two weeks before the mayoral election, Dae gets sidetracked from her political aspirations by a spirit in need of rescuing. An antique amber necklace allows Dae to connect with Maggie Madison, a witch who wants Dae to rebury her bones so she can rest in peace. But digging leads Dae to an even bigger mystery, a forty-year-old murder with ties to Randal Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mad DogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Wilson, her mayoral opponent.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€š\nDae wants to run a clean race, but town sentiment is mixed about whether sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s using her abilities to get the election to go her way. And when she learns that her own grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â€the former sheriff of Dare CountyÃ¢â‚¬â€might be mixed up in the long-buried tragedy, Dae will have to uncover the real killer and put Maggie to rest, before her political career ends up six feet underÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a155680ccc42722db3a7d31c62830625e5ffda8","amp;dn":"Missing+Pieces+Mystery+Series+-+Joyce+%26amp%3B+Jim+Lavener","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a155680ccc42722db3a7d31c62830625e5ffda8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,21,86,128,204,196,39,34,219,58,125,49,198,40,48,98,94,95,253,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
