Most of the backing tracks were done before touring the UK in November and December. Then, recording continued between February and the start of their summer dates in April and some final work was done after the mini US-tour done between April and May before their summer festival appearances in Europe and Japan.\n\nThe album&amp;#039;s first single, &quot;Love Is Noise&quot;, received its first airplay by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 on June 23, 2008.[3] The song reached #4 in the UK and became a summer hit in Europe. The band also released a non-album track, &quot;Mover&quot;, as a free digital download a week later.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(album)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e077bc7b0da0606fdccd0ed43ec6a1b382c802","amp;dn":"Forth+-+The+Verve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e077bc7b0da0606fdccd0ed43ec6a1b382c802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,224,119,188,123,13,160,96,111,220,205,14,212,62,198,161,179,130,200,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
