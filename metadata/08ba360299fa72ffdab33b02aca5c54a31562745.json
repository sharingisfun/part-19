The appeal of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwarfare on the cheapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has proved an irresistible strategic allure for nations through the centuries. However, proxy wars remain a missing link in contemporary war and security studies. \n\nIn this timely book Andrew Mumford sheds new light on the dynamics and lineage of proxy warfare from the Cold War to the War on Terror, whilst developing a cogent conceptual framework to explain their appeal.\n\nTracing the political and strategic development of proxy wars throughout the last century, they emerge as a dominant characteristic of contemporary conflict. The book ably shows how proxy interventions often prolong existing conflicts given the perpetuity of arms, money and sometimes proxy fighters sponsored by third party donors. Furthermore, it emphasizes why, given the direction of the War on Terror, the rise of China as a global power, and the prominence now achieved by non-state actors in the Ã¢â‚¬ËœArab SpringÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the phenomenon of proxy warfare is increasingly relevant to understandings of contemporary security.\n\nProxy Warfare is an indispensable guide for students and scholars interested in the evolution and potential future direction of war and conflict in the modern world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08ba360299fa72ffdab33b02aca5c54a31562745","amp;dn":"Proxy+Warfare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08ba360299fa72ffdab33b02aca5c54a31562745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,186,54,2,153,250,114,255,218,179,59,2,172,165,197,74,49,86,39,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
