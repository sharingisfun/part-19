For most of the band's existence, the members have been vocalist Anthony Kiedis, guitarist John Frusciante, bassist Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary, and drummer Chad Smith. The band's varied musical style has fused traditional funk with elements of other genres including alternative, punk rock, and psychedelic rock.\nIn addition to Kiedis and Flea, the group originally featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Slovak, however, died of a heroin overdose in 1988, resulting in Irons' departure. Irons was replaced briefly by former Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro before the band found a permanent replacement in Smith, while Slovak was replaced by up-and-coming guitarist Frusciante. This lineup recorded the band's fourth and fifth albums, Mother's Milk (1989) and Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991).\nBlood Sugar Sex Magik was a significant record for the band; having sold over thirteen million copies, it provided the group's initial mainstream commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with this new found success and left abruptly in the middle of the tour for the album in 1992, descending into heroin addiction. Kiedis, Flea, and Smith employed Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction for their subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although fairly successful, it did not match the critical acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik and sold less than half the copies of its predecessor. Shortly afterwards, Navarro departed the band due to creative differences. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band in 1998, at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which went on to sell fifteen million units worldwide, becoming their most successful album to date. It was followed three years later with By the Way (2002), which continued their success. In 2006, the group released the double album Stadium Arcadium, giving them their first American number one album.\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards. The band has sold over fifty-three million albums worldwide, have eight singles in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 (including three singles in the Top 10), have five number one singles on the Mainstream Rock charts, and hold a record of eleven number one singles on the Modern Rock charts. On September 23, 2009 the band was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2010. The Red Hot Chilli Peppers were ranked #30 on VH1's &quot;Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.\n\nBy the Way is the eighth studio album by American alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on July 9, 2002, on Warner Bros. Records. It sold over 282,000 copies in the first week, and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. The singles from the album included &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;, &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, &quot;Dosed&quot; and &quot;Universally Speaking&quot;. The lyrical subject matter vocalist Anthony Kiedis addresses in By the Way is a divergence from previous Chili Peppers albums, with Kiedis taking a more candid and reflective approach to his lyricism.\nBy the Way was applauded by critics as a departure from the band's previous styles, and is recognized for the melodic and subdued emotions given by the Chili Peppers. Guitarist John Frusciante is credited with writing most of the album's melodies, bass lines, and guitar progressions, therefore changing the direction of the recording dramatically: &quot;his warm, understated guitar work and his doo-wop style vocal harmonies are king this time around.&quot; By the Way contained virtually none of the signature punk-funk fusion the band had become known for playing. Frusciante has stated that writing &quot;By the Way [was] one of the happiest times in my life.&quot;\nThe album's guitar and bass ensemble was primarily dictated by Frusciante, rather than a collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on By the Way, utilizing tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout.\nKiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs such as &quot;Body of Water&quot;, &quot;Someone&quot; (both B-sides), &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;I Could Die for You&quot; and &quot;Warm Tape&quot; all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he had only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like &quot;This Is the Place&quot;, &quot;Don't Forget Me&quot;, and &quot;Dosed&quot; expressed his intense dislike for narcotics and the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him. He referenced late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in &quot;This Is the Place&quot;, and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: &quot;On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean&quot;. &quot;Venice Queen&quot; was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: &quot;We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen.&quot;\nBy the Way diverged from the band's previous styles, thus containing few funk-driven songs. &quot;Can't Stop&quot; and the title track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. &quot;Throw Away Your Television&quot;, while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other &quot;experimental&quot; tracks include the trumpet based &quot;On Mercury&quot;. &quot;Cabron&quot;, the only track to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, has visible Latin influences. &quot;Tear&quot; had a minor piano part, and &quot;Warm Tape&quot; was composed almost entirely on a keyboard.\nTechnically, By the Way saw the Chili Peppers employing several devices to distort and alter guitar and vocal sequences. &quot;Don't Forget Me&quot; utilizes a mellotron, wah pedal, and echoing techniques to convey an emotive atmosphere, while Frusciante uses a Big Muff for the solos on &quot;Minor Thing&quot;. Frusciante's backing vocals, although present in Californication, became dominant in By the Way, as almost every track contained his background presence..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2ae3dea32fcdca7ad942c91f3b720dda8e75b0e","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+-+By+The+Way+%282002%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2ae3dea32fcdca7ad942c91f3b720dda8e75b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,174,61,234,50,252,220,167,173,148,44,145,243,183,32,221,168,231,91,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
