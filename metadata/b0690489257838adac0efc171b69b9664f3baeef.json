As the stories unfold, a dual portrait emerges: that of a father who cared more for his career than for his family, and of a daughter who was deeply affected by his behavior. Working in counterpoint to the forceful text are sensual black and white images that depict both the extraordinary and ordinary events of daily life. Together, they create a formally complex and emotionally intense film.\n\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Su Friedrich - 1990 - Sink or Swim.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 606,965,760 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 47:40.376\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 608x464 (AR: 1.310)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1496 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.221 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----***----\n\n\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
