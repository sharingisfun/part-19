Shaun and the flock must struggle and strain to lift the heavy block and retrieve the precious toy.  \n\n\nEp#66: &quot;Pig Trouble&quot; \nOriginal Airdate: May 24, 2010  \nWhen Bitzer injures his foot and can't work, the Farmer chooses the pigs to take over his role. The power crazy pigs take the opportunity to turn the farm into a porky paradise - at the sheep's expense. Bitzer tries in vain to warn his master what is going on behind his back, but it's Shaun who steps in and restores the status quo ante.  \n\n\nEp#67: &quot;Bitzer from the Black Lagoon&quot; \nOriginal Airdate: May 25, 2010  \nWhile trying to retrieve his ball, Bitzer falls into a muddy pond. When Shaun sees a big, blobby, shambling 'thing' squelching across the field, he's convinced they are being attacked by a swamp monster.  \n\n\nEp#68: &quot;Zebra Ducks of the Serengeti&quot; \nOriginal Airdate: May 26, 2010  \nAfter getting covered in soot, two hapless ducks are mistaken for a pair of rare African Zebra Ducks. Seeing a way to make money, the farmer transforms Shaun's field into an exotic duck enclosure, which he gleefully opens to the public. Shaun doesn't appreciate losing his field and sets about exposing the fraud.  \n\n\nEp#69: &quot;Whistleblower&quot; \nOriginal Airdate: May 27, 2010  \nBitzer loses his precious whistle and tests out a trumpet as a replacement. Before long, the power of the trumpet goes to his head and his fanfares and jazz styled bugling drives the flock around the bend.  \n\n\nEp#70: &quot;The Big Chase&quot; \nOriginal Airdate: May 28, 2010  \nWhen Timmy drives off on the farmer's brand new quad bike, Shaun, Bitzer and the flock have to give chase by any means available. Very soon half the animals on the farm have joined in the chase. Can the sheep rescue Timmy and return the quad bike before the farmer finds out? \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Shaun_the_Sheep_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Shaun_the_Sheep_episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n*File Properties taken from Media Player Classic:\n\n1.
