It's amazing!\n\nThis book looks at where we (the population of planet Earth) are headed economically. \n\n8,000 years ago, we moved from hunter/gatherers to agriculture. We don't even remember the transition now. Will the industrial revolution, the information revolution, and our move into space all blur into pre-history, as records from this time of frantic change are lost? (How durable are the PDFs of your important documents?) Herman Kahn thinks that is exactly what is happening in this GREAT TRANSITION, which started in 1776 and may finish around 2176.\n\nHerman Kahn believes that during the early part of the GREAT TRANSITION, some nations (ACNs) will develop, and grow very wealthy. The income gap between rich (developed) and poor (agricultural) nations will explode to 175x! Later, we (the developed nations) will outsource factories as a way to develop other nations. This will lead to the income gap shrinking to 5x. His charts from 1979 are on track as of 2010.\n\nWill our resources run out, and neo-malthusians say, or, will we reach a world full of 15-30 billion fabulously rich capitalists? Herman Kahn reviewed the predictions of neo-malthusians from 1979, and made his own predictions that wealth would flow as the population increased. See who was right about the next 30 years, before you call the next 200 years.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775ce8f872feaf1b84204ff5514c88aa61252afe","amp;dn":"World+Economic+Development%2C+Complete.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775ce8f872feaf1b84204ff5514c88aa61252afe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,92,232,248,114,254,175,27,132,32,79,245,81,76,136,170,97,37,42,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
