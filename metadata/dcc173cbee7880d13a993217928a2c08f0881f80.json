Painted from Memory finds Costello and Bacharach revelling in their gifts on a dozen tracks that range from concise under-three-minute gems (&quot;I Still Have That Other Girl&quot;, which sounds like the great lost Chuck Jackson single) to sprawling art songs (&quot;Toledo&quot;, the pair's Grace of My Heart contribution &quot;God Give Me Strength&quot;). On the latter Costello meetsmoreÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ his match in a co-writer who knows when to let the excesses flow and when to stem the tide; his occasionally straining vocals only add to the album's heightened effect. The result is some instant classics that stand head and shoulders above much of Costello's 1990s work. \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
