For some reason they included the super-cheesy &quot;A Place In Your Heart&quot; from the &quot;Feed The Folk&quot; benefit record instead of the excellent, contemporaneous B-side &quot;Babies, If I Didn't Have You.&quot; I would have included it, but unfortunately my vinyl collection is a continent away...\n\n\n\n\nRIP Kate. We miss you already. \n\n\n\nP.S. Assuming this isn't out of print where you live, if you love it... please buy it!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b72b52c07dd32949b4935a2ba77fca6bc5300538","amp;dn":"Kate+%26+Anna+McGarrigle+--+Love+Over+and+Over+%281982%29+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b72b52c07dd32949b4935a2ba77fca6bc5300538","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,43,82,192,125,211,41,73,180,147,90,43,167,127,202,107,197,48,5,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
