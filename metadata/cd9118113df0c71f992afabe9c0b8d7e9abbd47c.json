It meant two things. The first was that we were still alive. . . .&quot;\n\nIn 1967, death was the constant companion of the Marines of Hotel Company, 2/5, as they patrolled the paddy dikes, mud, and mountains of the Arizona Territory southwest of Da Nang. But John Culbertson and most of the rest of Hotel Company were the same lean, fighting Marines who had survived the carnage of Operation Tuscaloosa. Hotel's grunts walked over the enemy, not around him. \n\nIn graphic terms, John Culbertson describes the daily, dangerous life of a soldier fighting in a country where the enemy was frequently indistinguishable from the allies, fought tenaciously, and thought nothing of using civilians as a shield. Though he was one of the top marksmen in 1st Marine Division Sniper School in Da Nang in March 1967--a class of just eighteen, chosen from the division's twenty thousand Marines--Culbertson knew that against the VC and the NVA, good training and experience could carry you just so far. But his company's mission was to find and engage the enemy, whatever the price. This riveting, bloody first-person account offers a stark testimony to the stuff U.S. Marines are made of.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sniper-Arizona-Battalion-Territory-ebook/dp/B001OERNO2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sniper-Arizona-Battalion-Territory-ebook/dp/B001OERNO2&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd9118113df0c71f992afabe9c0b8d7e9abbd47c","amp;dn":"A+Sniper+in+the+Arizona%3A+2nd+Battalion%2C+5th+Marines+in+the+Arizo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd9118113df0c71f992afabe9c0b8d7e9abbd47c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,145,24,17,61,240,199,31,153,42,250,190,156,11,141,126,154,187,212,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
