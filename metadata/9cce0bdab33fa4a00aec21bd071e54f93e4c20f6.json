Commonly cited as one of the most important works of Anglo-Saxon literature, Beowulf has been the subject of much scholarly study, theory, speculation, discourse, and, at 3182 lines, has been noted for its length. In the poem, Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, battles three antagonists: Grendel, who has been attacking the mead hall in Denmark called Heorot and its inhabitants; Grendel&amp;#039;s mother; and, later in life after returning to Geatland (modern southern Sweden) and becoming a king, he fights an unnamed dragon. Beowulf is fatally wounded in the final battle, and after his death he is buried in a barrow in Geatland by his retainers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cce0bdab33fa4a00aec21bd071e54f93e4c20f6","amp;dn":"beowulf+ebook+pdf+kindle+compatible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cce0bdab33fa4a00aec21bd071e54f93e4c20f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,206,11,218,179,63,164,160,10,236,33,189,7,30,84,249,62,76,32,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
