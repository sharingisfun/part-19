There are two\nversions, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64). If you are not sure which\nversion to use, open Control Panel &gt; System and check the &quot;System\ntype&quot;. You cannot run the 32-bit version of Process Hacker on a\n64-bit system and expect it to work correctly, unlike other programs.\n\n== System requirements ==\n\nWindows XP SP2 or higher, 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\n== Settings ==\n\nIf you are running Process Hacker from a USB drive, you may want to\nsave Process Hacker's settings there as well. To do this, create a\nblank file named &quot;ProcessHacker.exe.settings.xml&quot; in the same\ndirectory as ProcessHacker.exe. You can do this using Windows Explorer:\n\n1. Make sure &quot;Hide extensions for known file types&quot; is unticked in\n   Tools &gt; Folder options &gt; View.\n2. Right-click in the folder and choose New &gt; Text Document.\n3. Rename the file to ProcessHacker.exe.settings.xml (delete the &quot;.txt&quot;\n   extension).\n\n== Plugins ==\n\nPlugins can be configured from Hacker &gt; Plugins.\n\nIf you experience any crashes involving plugins, make sure they\nare up to date.\n\nThe ExtendedTools plugin is only available for Windows Vista and\nabove. Disk and Network information provided by this plugin is\nonly available when running Process Hacker with administrative\nrights.\n\n== KProcessHacker ==\n\nNOTE: The driver has been very generously signed by the\nReactOS Foundation (http://www.reactos.org).\n\nProcess Hacker uses a kernel-mode driver, KProcessHacker, to\nassist with certain functionality. This includes:\n\n* Bypassing security software and rootkits in limited ways\n* More powerful process and thread termination (*)\n* Setting DEP status of processes\n* Capturing kernel-mode stack traces\n* More efficiently enumerating process handles\n* Retrieving names for file handles\n* Retrieving names for EtwRegistration objects\n* Setting handle attributes\n\nThe feature(s) marked with an asterisk (*) are NOT available on 64-bit\nversions of Windows.\n\nCertain features such as modifying process protection are disabled\nin the released driver binary due to legal reasons. You can enable\nthem by building KProcessHacker with the &quot;dirty&quot; configuration.\n\nNote that by default, KProcessHacker only allows connections from\nprocesses with SeDebugPrivilege. To allow Process Hacker to show details\nfor all processes when it is not running as administrator:\n\n1. In Registry Editor, navigate to:\n   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesKProcessHacker2\n2. Under this key, create a key named Parameters if it does not exist.\n3. Create a DWORD value named SecurityLevel and set it to 0.\n4. Restart the KProcessHacker2 service (sc stop KProcessHacker2,\n   sc start KProcessHacker2).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5deeebc209c9036c9fb9e2683fba8f440c2d49a","amp;dn":"process+hacker+2.30+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5deeebc209c9036c9fb9e2683fba8f440c2d49a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,222,238,188,32,156,144,54,201,251,158,38,131,251,168,244,64,194,212,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
