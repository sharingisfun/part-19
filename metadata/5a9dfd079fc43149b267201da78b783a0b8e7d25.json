It's not very funny as a whole. The \nshtick is that the McKenzie brothers are lazy, beer-swilling dimwits who focus \non Canadian culture and rely heavily on slang interjections and put-downs like \n&quot;take off,&quot; &quot;beauty, eh?,&quot; and &quot;hoser.&quot; Only two selections are truly \nnoteworthy. The first is the catchy novelty hit &quot;Take Off,&quot; which features \nRush's Geddy Lee singing on the chorus. The edited single eliminated the \nplayful banter among Lee and the McKenzie brothers before and after the \nsong portion. Lee's supposed reason for participating? &quot;Ten bucks is ten \nbucks.&quot; The Yuletide favorite &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; replaces the \ntraditional gifts with items such as beer, turtleneck sweaters, French toast, \ntoques, backbacon, cigarettes, and comic books. The brothers are overcome \nby their version, and Bob McKenzie says it's comparable to &quot;Stairway to \nHeaven.&quot; A few other cuts are OK. &quot;The Beerhunter&quot; is about a Russian \nroulette-like game involving shaken cans of beer. (The title spoofs 1978's \nBest Picture Oscar winner &quot;The Deer Hunter,&quot; which included infamous \nRussian roulette scenes.) &quot;Doug's Mouth&quot; features goofy sound effects. \nMoranis and Thomas resurrected the Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie characters for the \n1983 cult film Strange Brew and beer commercials in the late '90s.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/great-white-north-mw0000073782&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/great-white-north-mw0000073782&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a9dfd079fc43149b267201da78b783a0b8e7d25","amp;dn":"Comedy+-+Bob+%26amp%3B+Doug+McKenzie+%281981%29+Great+White+North+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a9dfd079fc43149b267201da78b783a0b8e7d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,157,253,7,159,196,49,73,178,103,32,29,167,139,120,58,11,142,125,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
