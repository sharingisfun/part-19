And as Billy Bob's grandfather once told him, you do well in life by keeping the roots in a clear stream and not letting anyone taint the water for you. But in Holland's dusty little hometown of Deaf Smith, in the hill country north of Austin, local kingpin Earl Deitrich has made a fortune running roughshod and tainting anyone who stands in his way. Billy Bob has problems with Deitrich and his shamelessly callous demeanor, but can't shake the legacy of his passion for Deitrich's &quot;heartbreak-beautiful&quot; wife, Peggy Jean.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec173b390d9b87d72ace7b4a027ee3a71d72ca8","amp;dn":"Heartwood+by+James+Lee+Burke+%28Retail+-+Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec173b390d9b87d72ace7b4a027ee3a71d72ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,193,115,179,144,217,184,125,114,172,231,180,160,39,238,58,113,215,44,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
