And you get the impression from this four-track collection that the Swiss duo are more than ready for their chance, that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re chomping at the bit for the chance to prove themselves.\n\nPleasingly, the four tracks present serve as a very impressive calling card for AdriatiqueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Adrian Schweizer and Adrian Shala. Opening cut Deeper Love sets EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the soulful, nostalgic hue with its amorous vocals, gloom-tinged synths and a funk-slapped guitar that emerges mid-way through. A tender breakdown accentuate the trackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s groove and strut, giving it a gloriously summer sound.\n\nBy Your Side also looks back to the past, crafting a classic house sound through its deep bass , climbing chords and distant Gospel influenced vocals.\n\nThe proceeding Motions stays on the bubbling synth and guitar tipple. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a slow, no-frills low slung fusion of disco and house sensibilities, with a hypnotic vocal and dark synths warping into big drops and reprisals, that confirm it a dancefloor number regardless of its BPM.\n\nBody MovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ closes the package in style, offering a distinct final flavour with its up-front pads and squelching pads. However itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the use of a vocoder vocal hook that gives the track its infectious edge and confirms it as a future terrace weapon.\n\nAdriatique have clearly had their ears to the floor in the last two years; the gestalt of melody, breakdowns and basslines are certain to make this a package that works across the house and disco board. And with the four synth-heavy cuts oozing more funk and soul than youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re likely to hear in half a dozen lesser EPs, expect to hear much more from these two in the coming months.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c735523332253817c90217ceb43f44f864991a28","amp;dn":"Adriatique+-+Body+Movin%26rsquo%3B+EP+%5BZypheiron%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c735523332253817c90217ceb43f44f864991a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,53,82,51,50,37,56,23,201,2,23,206,180,63,68,248,100,153,26,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
