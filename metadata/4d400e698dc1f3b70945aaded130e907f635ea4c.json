So much beauty is created, it makes the air vibrate and lets your emotions roam free... &quot; \n(Martijn Welzen massmovement.co.uk/wordpress) \n\n&quot;Metallic Taste Of Blood brings together arch six-string experimentalist Eraldo Bernocchi with Porcupine Tree bassist Colin Edwin, percussive noise soldier Balazs Pandi and keyboardist and avant-jazz alumni Jamie Saft. An intriguing collaboration in theory, and even more mind-boggling in practice. It's a dark and maze-like scramble through ever-changing instrumental soundscapes&quot; (Prog) \n\n&quot;Manifestly undefinable, Metallic Taste Of Blood collects very diverse strands and genres of music (from metal, dub, avant-jazz and progressive rock primarily) and fuses them into instrumental compositions that tightly straddle what on paper appear total opposites (thus truly representing RareNoiseRecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ethos).
