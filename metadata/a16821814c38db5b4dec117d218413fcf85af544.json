With long hours, a staff with enough issues to keep a psych ward in business, and the police regularly on his case, twenty-nine-year-old Cain is starting to second guess his unspoken mission to save the women he employs. And then blond, brown-eyed Charlie Rourke walks through his door, and things get really complicated. Cain abides by a strict Ã¢â‚¬Å“no sleeping with the staffÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rule. But being around Charlie challenges CainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-controlÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a long time since any woman has done that.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Charlie Rourke needs a lot of money, really fast, in order to vanish before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late. Taking her clothes off for men makes her stomach curl but Charlie tells herself that at least sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s putting her acting and dancing skills to good use. And though her fellow dancers seem eager to nab their sexy, sophisticated, and genuinely caring boss, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not interested. After all, Charlie Rourke doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really existÃ¢â‚¬â€and the girl pretending to be her can't get distracted by romance.\n\nUnfortunately, Charlie soon discovers that developing feelings for Cain is inevitable, and that those feelings may not be unrequitedÃ¢â‚¬â€but losing him when he finds out what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involved with will be more painful than any other sentence awaiting her.\nGenre: New Adult, Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16821814c38db5b4dec117d218413fcf85af544","amp;dn":"Four+Seconds+to+Lose+-+K.A.+Tucker.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16821814c38db5b4dec117d218413fcf85af544","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,104,33,129,76,56,219,91,77,236,17,125,33,132,19,252,248,90,245,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
