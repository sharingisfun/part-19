But at the time, we didn't know.\n\nIt was good that we filmed it, though.\nThe film is powerful now.\nWhat we said then could have been said now.\n\nIn fact, there are things that we said then in the film, which may give some encouragement and inspiration to the activists of today. Good luck to us all.\n\nLet's remember WAR IS OVER if we want it.\nIt's up to us, and nobody else.\nJohn would have wanted to say that.\n\nLove, yoko\n\nYoko Ono Lennon\nLondon, UK\nAugust 2011\n\n\nABOUT THIS EXCLUSIVE SCREENING OF BED PEACE\n\nBED PEACE is FREE to watch exclusively here on YouTube and IMAGINEPEACE.com for ONE WEEKEND ONLY, ending at midnight (NY time) on Sunday 14th August 2011.\n\n\nABOUT BED PEACE\n\n1969 was the year that John &amp; Yoko intensified their long running campaign for World Peace. They approached the task with the same entrepreneurial expertise as an advertising agency selling a brand of soap powder to the masses. John &amp; Yoko's product however was PEACE, not soft soap, and they were determined to use any slogan, event and gimmick in order to persuade the World to buy it.\n\nBED PEACE (directed by Yoko &amp; John and filmed by Nic Knowland) is a document of the Montreal events and features John &amp; Yoko in conversation with, amongst others, The World Press, satirist Al Capp, activist Dick Gregory, comedian Tommy Smothers, protesters at Berkeley's People's Park, Rabbi Abraham L. Feinberg, quiltmaker Christine Kemp, psychologists Timothy Leary &amp; Rosemary Leary, CFOX DJs Charles P. Rodney Chandler &amp; Roger Scott, producer AndrÃƒÂ© Perry, journalist Ritchie York, DJ &amp; Promoter Murray The K, filmmaker Jonas Mekas, publicist Derek Taylor &amp; personal assistant Anthony Fawcett.\n\nFeatured songs are Plastic Ono Band's GIVE PEACE A CHANCE &amp; INSTANT KARMA, Yoko's REMEMBER LOVE &amp; WHO HAS SEEN THE WIND &amp; John's acoustic version of BECAUSE.\n\n&quot;As we said before: WAR IS OVER!
