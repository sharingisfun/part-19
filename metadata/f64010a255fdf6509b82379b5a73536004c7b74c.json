This BBC mini-series is a superb costume drama with stellar performances by the entire cast. Set in rural England, the film centres around Molly Gibson, the seventeen year old daughter of a country doctor. Richly drawn portraits of Molly's neighbours and friends quickly emerge and weave an absorbing tapestry of nineteenth century life.\n\nMolly and her father, a widower for most of Molly's life, have an exceptionally close and loving relationship. Their relationship is put to the test when he decides to marry a widow and former governess, Hyacinth, who is a pretentious, self absorbed, ridiculous woman. She has a grown daughter named Cynthia, a beautiful young woman, close to Molly in age, but as different from Molly as night and day. Cynthia is best described as a Marilyn Monroe of the Victorian age. Cynthia and Molly become fast friends, while Molly barely tolerates her nigh intolerable step-mother.\n\nThe series really revolves around Molly's relationships with all the characters in the production and her handling of the various everyday situations in which she finds herself. Richly drawn, memorable characters, as well as intrigues, secrets, and romance, make this a highly absorbing drama and one that those who love period pieces and lush, well acted costume dramas will enjoy. It is simply a masterpiece.\n\n\nCast:\n\nJustine Waddell ... Molly Gibson (4 episodes, 1999)\nBill Paterson ... Mr. Gibson (4 episodes, 1999)\nFrancesca Annis ...
