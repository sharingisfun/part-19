A series I put together to give back to other uploaders here and elsewhere on the web.\n\nIt's called War and History Audiobooks (although it is mostly about war). I have divided it up into 6 separate torrents because it was about 18 Gigs as one torrent. I have listed the titles here, but since I have already spent a lot of time on this, I have not provided a description. You can look each of them up to get more info if you wish.\n\nThis is torrent 6 of 6 containing:\n\nAfghanistan-Games Without Rules\nCrusade-The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War\nLone Survivor (Navy Seal team 10)\nTTC - Thinking about Cybersecurity\nTTC Audio - Espionage and Covert Operations\n\n\nHope this is satisfactory--let me know if it's not.\nI will seed for as long as possible, but give me some help.
