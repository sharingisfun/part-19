Scrivener supports wordsmiths of all types, and it's designed especially for long-form writing projectsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½scripts, novels, academic works, and more.\n\nUsing MelvilleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Moby-Dick as his exemplar, author Kirk McElhearn walks you through using Scrivener to create and manage a writing project. You'll learn how to use ScrivenerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Binder, Outliner, and Corkboard to develop characters and settings, collect and organize research materials, and arrange your scenes. Kirk even explains how to keep yourself on track by composing in Scrivener's Full Screen mode and by setting daily progress targets, all on the way to helping you produce a polished, submission-ready manuscript.\n\nYou'll learn how to handle each aspect of the flexible Scrivener manuscript-generation process:\n\nSet up: Add reference materials to your project for easy accessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½videos, audio files, PDFs, Web resources, and more. And, if you've already written bits of text, you can import those items too, including OPML outline files (such as from OmniOutliner Pro). Beyond importing from the Finder, you can use Mac OS X Services or Scrivener's handy Scratch Pad panel. Or, you can use the Import and Split feature to import a long document into multiple chapters or segments in Scrivener.\n\nOrganize: Use the Outliner, Corkboard, Collections, and Binder to mix and match your content into the perfect final arrangement. For example, you can:\n\nIgnore the concept of a traditional file and break your manuscript into sections based on character, theme, topic, scene, or whatever you like.\nOrganize your manuscript linearly in the Outliner.\nUse search Collections to search for a character, location, or phrase and see just those texts.\nOrganize ideas by dragging and pinning index cards on the Corkboard.\nWrite: Use Full Screen mode to hide distractions so you can wordsmith in peace; set up Typewriter Scrolling to keep your writing focus at the center of the screen, not the bottom; and view more than one part of your project at once, so you can write in one section while referring to another. Also, use Scrivenings view to write one thread of a story all at once in a single view, even if it is broken up in multiple scenes or chapters in the final manuscript.\n\nFormat: Optimize the formatting you see when you work in Scrivener for your eyes and your screen, and understand how this can differ from the formatting in a &quot;compiled&quot; version of your manuscript.\n\nRevise: Use revision marking and the useful Snapshot capability to experiment with and compare the effect of different revision strategies, while still being able to roll back to a previous version.\n\nBe Mobile: Work on your project using more than one Mac, or on an iPad.\n\nCompile: Don't worry if the term &quot;compile&quot; is unfamiliar; it enables you to assemble your manuscript into linear order, in a form that can be printed or converted to common file formats. Scrivener supports RTF, Microsoft Word, Final Draft, PDF, and EPUB.\n\nSpecific questions answered in the ebook include:\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the difference between a Scrivener folder and a file?\nHow do I change which columns appear in the Outliner?\nHow do I open the Inspector and control what appears in it?\nWhat is the relationship between Corkboard index cards and Finder items?\nHow do I monitor character, word, or page count?\nHow do text format presets work?\nHow do I track changes when I revise a draft?\nHow do I change the color of a revision level?\nWhat is the difference between an annotation, a comment, and a footnote?\nHow do I export in an ebook format from Scrivener?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:668cc13a451df11a73f0a45098243919db7bdd61","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Take+Control+of+Scrivener+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"668cc13a451df11a73f0a45098243919db7bdd61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,140,193,58,69,29,241,26,115,240,164,80,152,36,57,25,219,123,221,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
