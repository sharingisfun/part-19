The band was composed of guitarist and singers Doyle Bramhall II and Charlie Sexton and two former members of Stevie Ray Vaughan's band Double Trouble, drummer Chris Layton. and bassist Tommy Shannon. The 'Arc' in the band's name came from the Austin Rehearsal Complex where the band first started jamming.\n\nTheir 1992 debut album, Arc Angels, met with critical approval and reached #127 on the Billboard chart. Arc Angels made their network television debut on the NBC show, Late Night with David Letterman, on June 9, 1992, performing &quot;Living In A Dream&quot;. They performed on the show again on January 6, 1993, this time playing &quot;Too Many Ways to Fall&quot;.\n\nBramhall's heroin addiction and internal friction caused the breakup of the band in 1993.[2] The Arc Angels broke up in October of that year, concluding their run with a series of farewell concerts at Austin's Backyard outdoor venue. Beginning in 2002, the Arc Angels reunited for occasional live performances.[3]\n\nIn recent years, Bramhall has played guitar in Eric Clapton's band and toured with Roger Waters. Charlie Sexton has toured with Bob Dylan. Meanwhile, Layton and Shannon have recorded three albums with the Texas soul quintet Storyville. They have also backed such artists as Buddy Guy, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and John Mayer.\n\nIn March 2009, the members of Arc Angels, minus Shannon, announced that they would be reuniting, releasing a DVD of concert footage taken during 2005, touring extensively and beginning work on their second album. The DVD contained two new songs.[4] The launch of their tour was at Austin's annual South by Southwest Festival. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArc Angels 1992\n\n\n\nArc Angels is the self-titled debut album by The Arc Angels, released in 1992.
