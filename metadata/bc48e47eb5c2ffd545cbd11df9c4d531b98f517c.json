Disc two leans more towards the &quot;alternative&quot; era, which still featured punk-oriented acts like Nomeansno (who were technically from Victoria, but it's close enough for punk) and Slow, but also included more pop fare in the form of bands like Oversoul Seven. These aren't the only touch points, however, with forays into hardcore, folk, surf, and more.\n\nA few things are of particular note on this compilation: first, the inclusion of an early track by 54.40, who would go on to become one of Canada's most enduring pop acts. Secondly, a mini-Art Bergmann overview, featuring his early work with the bands Young Canadians (who do the classic &quot;Hawaii&quot;), Los Popularos, and Poisoned, who went on to be his backup band when he started performing under his own name.\n\nThere are also a number of performers here who would go on to other things: David Wisdom of U-J3RK5 would later become a late-night host on the CBC, and Bob Rock, who produced many of these early punk classics later became a big-name heavy metal producer for acts like Van Halen and Metallica. Though some of the tracks are more forgettable than others, there are enough lost classics here (Slow being the most notable) to make the album a must-have for anyone who lived through this era, even if you were from Toronto at the time.\n\nLabel:Zulu Records \nCatalog#:ZULU 5-2 \nFormat:2 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ CD, Compilation \nCountry:Canada \nReleased:Nov 1991 \nGenre:Rock \nStyle:New Wave, Punk \n\n\nTracklist:\nDisc 1\nWhat Do You Want Me To Be (Furies)\nFucked Up Baby (Skulls)\nDisco Sucks (D.O.A.)\nFuck You (Stiffs)\nI Wanna Be A Girl (Generators)\nI Don't Love You (Dishrags)\nNothing Holding You (Active Dog)\nI Don't Give A Shit (BIZ)\nNew Clientele (Shades)\nReal Thing (Pointed Sticks)\nScience Fiction (Private School)\nSlave To My Dick (Subhumans)\nHawaii (Young Canadians)\nDivided By Three (Female Hands)\nEisenhower &amp; The Hippies (U-J3RK5)\nBarbra (Modernettes)\nOff The Deep End (Insex)\n634 Dog (AKA)\nWaiting For The Drugs To Take Hold (Secret V's)\nSeen A Fight (Tim Ray)\nShame I Feel (Corsage)\nSynchronized Swimming (Popular Front)\nYank (54-40)\nMystery Movie (Scissors)\nCan't Come Back (Los Popularos)\nMusic Is Your Body (Moral Lepers)\nTeenage Barnacle (Enigmas)\nParty Dog (Actionauts)\n\n\nDisc 2\nThe Crush (Family Plot)\nSelf-Pity (NoMeansNo)\nWork Song (The Work Party)\nInevitable (Bolero Lava)\nEdge (I, Braineater)\nJust Another Day (Go Four 3)\nLearning To Live (Animal Slaves)\nHappy Man (Brilliant Orange)\nHave Not Been The Same (Slow)\nAmerican Desert (Shanghai Dog)\nBe Like Us (No Fun)\nBone Of Contention (Cannon Heath Down)\nEvil Town (Lost Durangos)\nDirty Ol' Town (Herald Nix)\nTo Tell The Truth (Poisoned)\nTalk To The Birds (Bob's Your Uncle)\nKing Blood (Rhythm Mission)\nSolitary Man (Scramblers)\n1 + 1 is 3 (Oversoul Seven)\nDarker Than This (The Hip Type)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc48e47eb5c2ffd545cbd11df9c4d531b98f517c","amp;dn":"Last+Call+-+Vancouver+Independent+Music+1977-88+-+VA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc48e47eb5c2ffd545cbd11df9c4d531b98f517c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,72,228,126,181,194,255,213,69,203,209,29,249,196,213,49,185,143,81,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
