Cross-over episodes are TVrips with logos. Season 2 episodes are better quality than Season 1.\n\nSource: Several other torrents, and eMule.\n\n-- Note: I have re-timed all episodes of the 2nd season of Iron Man from PAL 25fps to the original 23.976fps, so that the kick-arse screamin' guitar rock soundtrack doesn't sound like garbage. (1st season soundtrack is lame either way, so I didn't bother with those.) I also re-timed the cross-over episodes so Spidey and Hulk's soundtracks are true.)\n\nAlso contains version 3.1 of the Cartoon Rating Guide for Smart Adults.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbd2415145158d18a7a7d1e22b28af13ad5c1418","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+TAS+DVDrip+season+1%2C2%2Ccrossovers+cartoon+animated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbd2415145158d18a7a7d1e22b28af13ad5c1418","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,210,65,81,69,21,141,24,167,167,209,226,43,40,175,19,173,92,20,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
