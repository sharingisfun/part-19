The album cover is a photograph by Eugene Merinov. The album was originally a bonus disc with the initial limited edition of the 1982 studio album The Sky's Gone Out. Later in the year it was released as a separate album, with initial copies receiving a free single (Satori in Paris) and poster pack. The single features live versions of &quot;Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; not recorded at the same gigs from the album, the poster being a montage of the bands history on stage and beyond.\n\nThe album was re-issued in 1988 with six bonus tracks, including the previously unissued &quot;Of Lillies and Remains&quot; and a cover of The Velvet Underground's &quot;Waiting for the Man&quot; recorded live at Fagins, Manchester, 22 October 1981, featuring Nico on vocals (this track was also a track on the &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; single).\n\nTracklist\n1 In the Flat Field (4:27)\n2 Rosegarden Funeral of Sores (John Cale - 5:14)\n3 Dancing Bauhaus (2:32)\n4 The Man With the X-Ray Eyes (3:41)\n5 Bela Lugosi's Dead (9:35)\n6 The Spy in the Cab (4:06)\n7 Kick in the Eye (3:37)\n8 In Fear of Fear (2:51)\n9 Hollow Hills (4:11)\n10 Stigmata Martyr (3:34)\n11 Dark Entries (4:28)\n\nBonus Tracks\n12 Terror Couple Kill Colonel (3:41)\n13 Double Dare (5:47)\n14 In the Flat Field (4:13)\n15 Hair of the Dog (2:47)\n16 Of Lillies and Remains (3:28)\n17 Waiting for the Man (Lou Reed - 4:28)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bdfa78e4e00b6d62ca8d49ee4f823a09d6877d8","amp;dn":"Bauhaus-Press+The+Eject+And+Give+Me+The+Tape+%28mp3+192+kb%2Fs%29+%5Btnt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bdfa78e4e00b6d62ca8d49ee4f823a09d6877d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,223,167,142,78,0,182,214,44,168,212,158,228,248,35,160,157,104,119,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
