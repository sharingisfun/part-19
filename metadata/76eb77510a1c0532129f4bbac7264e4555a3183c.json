I'm putting up most of my favorite albums of Progressive Trance, Progressive House, Tech House, and Acid House that I have collected over the past 10 years or so.  I'm putting up a few at a time to seed and need everyone that downloads them to PLEASE SEED THEM for atleast a week so everyone can get to DL them and enjoy them.  My broadband is somewhat slow so I can only put up a few at a time and need the help to seed them.  If you build it they will come.  I've got over 50 albums (100+ CDs/mixes) I am going to put up so I do need the help seeding them all.  If anyone has any good albums(this style of music) to put up i'd appreciate it if you did or if you could leave in the comments section where else to find some really good albums or suggestions of really good albums or mixes.  Thanks\n\nFirst disc is nice chill mellow stuff that Nick Warren's known for.  Second disc has some really nice Pro. Trance/House trax... a few by 16 Bit Lolitas who have been pretty hot over the past few years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76eb77510a1c0532129f4bbac7264e4555a3183c","amp;dn":"Nick+Warren-+Global+Underground+30-+PARIS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76eb77510a1c0532129f4bbac7264e4555a3183c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,235,119,81,10,28,5,50,18,159,75,186,199,38,78,69,85,163,24,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
