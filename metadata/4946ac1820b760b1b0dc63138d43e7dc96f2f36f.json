Great harmonies, good country picking, and great songs. This album definitely set the tone for their career, and there was nowhere to go but up from here. If you like the new generation of Country music, then you should have this album in your collection. These boys mix upbeat shuffles with ballads covering a large range of music on just one album. There is nothing these two can't play.\n\nThe best song on the album is the closing ballad &quot;Still In Love with You&quot;. They lyrics are shear poetry. Another great ballad is &quot;Neon Moon&quot;. Again, they hit the nail on the head with &quot;Lost and Found&quot;. For as good as their ballads are, their upbeat stuff is incredible as well. &quot;Boot Scootin' Boogie&quot; pretty much put them on the roadmap of Country music, but songs like &quot;Cool Drink of Water&quot; with its upbeat humor just show this band's versatility.\n\nCountry music has a bright future with bands like Brooks and Dunn making music of this caliber. Music like this is becoming more mainstream and popular. Garth Brooks might have started that movement, but artists like B&amp;D, Alan Jackson, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw are carrying that momentum with ease.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrooks &amp; Dunn - Brand New Man\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Brooks &amp; Dunn\nAlbum................: Brand New Man\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
