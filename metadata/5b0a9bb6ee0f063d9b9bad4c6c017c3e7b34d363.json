Sooooo here, finally, in Lester Bangs &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; fashion, are the reasons.\n1. Throughout the entire album, vocalist Michael Stipe purposely makes the lyrics unintelligible so that the listener can more easily interpret the songs for his/herself. This may have also been a way to guarantee keeping this album in the underground so that it would never become popular with the uncool MTV crowd.\n\n2. The talents of bassist Mike Mills should never be overlooked. Ever hear his basswork during the &quot;Straight off the boat, where to go?&quot; section of &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot;, or the intro to &quot;Laughing&quot;? That song has THREE separate melodies in its three minutes of existence, and they're ALL great. \n\n3. I read somewhere that the band was so ego-free that they had every instrument and the vocals balanced out in the mix so that no part would stand out. They wanted it to sound like a mush, which I think is really innovative, considering the overblown heavy metal that was popular at the time (this was 1983 remember).\n\n4. A sad lament: Nobody makes their drums sound like the ones in the beginning of &quot;Catapult&quot; anymore. \n\nExcellent drumming that actually sets a mood and isn't just mindless thumpity thump thump. Oh, and Bill Berry also wrote the piano line for &quot;Perfect Circle&quot;, and for which we should all be eternally grateful.\n\n5. One of the best &quot;anti-album cover&quot; album covers: the dark kudzu tree field. The words &quot;R.E.M. Murmur&quot; are hardly noticeable, the song titles are arranged out of order (and in large purple smudgy type), the band members look as if they're having the worst day of their life, Michael looks funny with glasses, the title for &quot;Moral Kiosk&quot; is arranged vertically, and they even pick a typeface that's very difficult to read. \n\n6. &quot;Perfect Circle&quot; is the greatest song ever written.\n\n7. Like all classic albums, every time I listen to it I notice something new. Just yesterday, I noticed something that sounds a lot like a Gregorian chant or something during the refrain of &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;. You have to really sit down and PAY ATTENTION to the little things, like the piano in &quot;Shaking Through&quot;, or the thunder in &quot;We Walk&quot;.\n\n8. Trying to figure out what Michael Stipe is singing (especially during the chaotic bridge section in &quot;9-9&quot;) is one of the best things about it. It makes you think, but not in a heavy pretensious manner. They could have equally called it &quot;Mumble&quot;.\n\n9. It was the very first &quot;alternative&quot; album. It sounded like absolutely nothing that was popular at the time, and it seemed to come from out of nowhere. I think Peter Buck once said something like &quot;We wanted to make a record that had no influences so that nobody could say, 'Oh they sound like this band or that band'&quot;. And it came out at the right time. I don't know. It was just like, finally! After years of synth-heavy new wave one hit wonders and disco camp, there FINALLY was the band that meant as much to you as the Beatles and Stones meant to your parents. Ehh... Or something. That's how I felt, anyways. I mean if it wasn't R.E.M. then who was gonna save rock and roll? Okay okay the Replacements, but I mean BESIDES them. Huey Lewis and the News? Phil Collins? Motley Crue? 38 Special? See, the whole reason the words &quot;alternative&quot; and &quot;indie-rock&quot; were invented was because by 1984, MTV and &quot;Thriller&quot; had killed the face of mainstream music and it was albums like this that were considered worthwhile &quot;alternatives&quot; to the mainstream corporate rock sound. &quot;Murmur&quot; started all of that.\n\n10. It's the greatest album ever made ever in the history of music since the beginning of time. But that's just me. You might hate it for some reason.
