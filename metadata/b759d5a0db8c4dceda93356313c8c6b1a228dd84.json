Little Britain.\nThe fifth film in Andrew Marr's epic six-part series charting the events that shaped Britain. A climate of betrayal, political extremism and unemployment pervaded 1930s Britain, with the country descending into chaos following the financial crash on Wall Street. Modern Britain had one eye on the future and one nostalgic eye on the past, but with Fascists on the march in Europe, our reticent nature was put to to the test, and the country finally chose confrontation over appeasement.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 3245 Kb/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nRun-Time: 58 mins\nFrame Rate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 1.45GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n\nforums dot mvgroup dot org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b759d5a0db8c4dceda93356313c8c6b1a228dd84","amp;dn":"BBC+Andrew+Marrs+The+Making+of+Modern+Britain+5of6+HDTV+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b759d5a0db8c4dceda93356313c8c6b1a228dd84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,89,213,160,219,140,77,206,218,147,53,99,19,200,198,177,162,40,221,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
