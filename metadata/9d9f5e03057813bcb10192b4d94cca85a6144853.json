Once again we enrol the services of crate digging\nexpert Dean Rudland for compiling duties and following the\nsuccess of his Backbeats compilations &quot;Gimme A Break&quot; and\n&quot;Crate Digging Fever&quot; we're delighted to say he's topped\nhimself with this selection\n\n&quot;The Breaks&quot; - 15th Anniversary Crystal Edition is quite\nsimply one of the most comprehensive collections of original\nbreak beats on the market and is an essential purchase for\nall lovers of the original Funk and Soul samples which have\nsince been utilised by thousands of acts ever since. Many of\nthe tracks on this album are currently unavailable elsewhere\nelse and, as a result, demand for them has built up via the\nnew generations of producers and creative samplers who want\nto get their hands on the original source material,\nincluding such highly in-demand and sought-after tracks like\n&quot;The Champ&quot; - The Mohawks, &quot;It's A New Day&quot; - Skull Snaps,\n&quot;Don't Change Your Love&quot; - Five Stairsteps &amp; Cubie, &quot;Bra&quot; &amp;\n&quot;The Message&quot;- Cymande, &quot;Tramp&quot; - Lowell Fulsom, &quot;Good Ole\nMusic&quot; - Funkadelic, &quot;Run Nigger&quot; - Last Poets and many\nmore.\n\nIn addition to the above, we've also included a number of\nlater tracks which have since become highly collectable in\nbreak beat circles and yet collectors still struggle to find\nthem on CD in 2011. Gems like Liquid Liquid's &quot;Cavern&quot;\n(where Grandmaster Melle Mel's &quot;White Lines&quot; bass-line came\nfrom), Manzel's &quot;Space Funk&quot;, Taana Gardner's &quot;Heartbeat&quot;\nand Vaughan Mason's &quot;Jammin' Big Guitar&quot; being just four\nexamples of incredibly hard-to-find gems which are almost\nimpossible to find on CD...until now\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d9f5e03057813bcb10192b4d94cca85a6144853","amp;dn":"VA-The_Breaks_15th_Anniversary_Crystal_Edition-2CD-2011-FTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d9f5e03057813bcb10192b4d94cca85a6144853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,159,94,3,5,120,19,188,177,1,146,180,217,76,202,133,166,20,72,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
