Or rather, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as much a biopic as one of FelliniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-referential reveries. At the start, the adult Brodsky (Grigoriy Dityatkovskiy) warns his recollections wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be linear, and indeed, the conceit of Brodsky sailing back to Russia years after his exile, offering time to muse on his past, is pure fiction. Khrzhanovsky uses the concept as a way of tying together childhood and maturity, and if the picÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second half is less brimming with flights of whimsy than the first, that, too, is the essence of nostalgia.\n\nHis reminiscences begin in 1948, when his father (Sergei Yursky) returns to Leningrad from the clean-up of World War II, bringing presents from the Far East. Father and mother (the great Alisa Freindlich) create a wonderland of familial warmth within their high-bourgeois apartment (shot in color, with black-and-white used for exteriors set in this timeframe). The helmer flawlessly re-creates the very texture of films from the periods covered, shifting as the decades move forward.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41a054022d908d54ac0f7d4a7f45fb79aaccccca","amp;dn":"Room.And.a.Half.Andrey.Khrzhanovskiy.DVDRip.XviD.2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41a054022d908d54ac0f7d4a7f45fb79aaccccca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,160,84,2,45,144,141,84,172,15,125,74,127,69,251,121,170,204,204,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
