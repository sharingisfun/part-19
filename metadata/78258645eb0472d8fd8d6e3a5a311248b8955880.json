He attempted to shun the assignment until God explained it to him a little more clearly! His message to Nineveh:40 days and you get yours! The greatest miracle in the book of Jonah was Nineveh's repentance, within the allotted 40 days, on speculation! They reasoned that maybe, if they repented, God might change His mind. They did. And He did.\n\nA century later, Nahum was sent to ask them to repent and Nineveh failed. Judgment resulted.\n\nObadiah prophesied against Israel's enemies. His book provides insights into the 2nd Coming of Jesus Christ and why some countries will apparently escape the rule of the Antichrist. These are three small books of the Bible that contribute a critical perspective for all of us.\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78258645eb0472d8fd8d6e3a5a311248b8955880","amp;dn":"Chuck+Missler+-+Prophets+To+The+Gentiles+-++Jonah%2C+Nahum%2C+Obadia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78258645eb0472d8fd8d6e3a5a311248b8955880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,37,134,69,235,4,114,216,253,141,110,58,90,49,18,72,184,149,88,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
