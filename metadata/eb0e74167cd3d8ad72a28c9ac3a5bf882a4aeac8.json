Commands for Minecraft PE just like the PC version!!\n\n- Now you can use commands like Ã¢â‚¬ËœgiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢teleportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in your OWN Minecraft PE Game :)\n- Play with your friends over BlueTooth when a WiFi connection isn't available.\n- Play multiplayer online on hundreds of Pocketmine servers.\n\nPlug for Minecraft PE plugs into Minecraft PE to give you Ã¢â‚¬ËœBukkitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ style commands in your game. Plug works in both single player AND multiplayer games, so both you as the owner of the world, and players who connect are able to use the commands available.\n\nAll commands are controlled from inside Minecraft PE chat, just like Plugins on the PC version of Minecraft.\n\nNow you can use commands like Ã¢â‚¬ËœgiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to give yourself items in survival mode, or Ã¢â‚¬ËœteleportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to teleport yourself to another location or player. In this version weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve added lots of commands you normally only see in the PC version of the game. \n\nPlug is very easy to use, all you have to do is open Minecraft PE and start a world. Once in the game use commands by typing them directly into the chat. For example to show help: .h\n\nPlug is a world first and no other App exists like it on the App Store. We are constantly developing it and hope to implement every PC plugin possible eventually!\n\n[NOTE: This application requires you to have either the free or paid version of Minecraft PE and will not work without it]\n\nDisclaimer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ This is a third party App, it is not the game MineCraft or affiliated with the game or its creators in anyway","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0e74167cd3d8ad72a28c9ac3a5bf882a4aeac8","amp;dn":"Plug+for+Minecraft+%5BPE%5D+Pocet+Edition+v+1.32+IPhone+IOS+.ipa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0e74167cd3d8ad72a28c9ac3a5bf882a4aeac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,14,116,22,124,211,216,173,114,162,140,154,195,165,191,136,42,74,234,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
