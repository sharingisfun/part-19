The question arises to what extend the pro-Israel lobby ultimately determines the military and political importance of Israel itself. Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson (Colin Powell's former chief-of-staff) explains how the lobby's influence affects the decision-making structure in the White House.\n\nResearch: William de Bruijn\nDirector: Marije Meerman \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vpro.nl/programma/tegenlicht/afleveringen/34338524/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vpro.nl/programma/tegenlicht/afleveringen/34338524/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:098b6eca0ce77a686fac9a0c01972776a2ff7192","amp;dn":"The+Israel+Lobby+-+Dutch+TV+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"098b6eca0ce77a686fac9a0c01972776a2ff7192","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,139,110,202,12,231,122,104,111,172,154,12,1,151,39,118,162,255,113,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
