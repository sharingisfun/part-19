As before same old brief introduction.\n\nNTSC, 16:9 widescreen format in a iso file of the DVD from the box set. Mount it or burn it then watch it or sleep thru it. It is all there with menus ect.and this season they include the directors commentary and a few cheesy bonus features or specials. \nThere is NO alternate language tracks or subtitles. They spent little to produce these. Next season they include foreign audio tracks, isn't that nice of them?\n\nThis is getting so repetitive I need to go smoke something.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a13ed2547a64bbdf731d750f34be9dc85bd9ccbb","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG1+Season+7+Disk+1+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a13ed2547a64bbdf731d750f34be9dc85bd9ccbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,62,210,84,122,100,187,223,115,29,117,15,52,190,157,200,91,217,204,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
