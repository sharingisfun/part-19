Scheduled for release on October 7, 2014 via Carved Records,[1] the album will be produced by Bob Marlette[2] and Skidd Mills. The lyric video for the first single, &quot;Monster in Me&quot; was released on August 19, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas has been known for many things through the years and Texas Hippie Coalition is just the next commodity from the great Lone Star State. The band of outlaws return with their unique blend of red dirt metal with Ride On. The album is set to drop on October 7th via Carved Records/Caroline Distribution. From the guttural laugh on album opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“El Diablo RojoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the chugging outro of closer Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Am The EndÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, it is clear Texas Hippie Coalition are back with a vengeance. The band is comprised of one of hard rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most engaging frontmen Big Dad Ritch on vocals, Cord Pool on guitars, John Exall on bass guitar and Timmy Braun on drums. Ride On proves Texas Hippie Coalition is taking it to the next level and looking to recruit new outlaws to join them on their musical adventure.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like Lynyrd Skynyrd and ZZ Top had a child, and Pantera ended up raising it,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ exclaims Big Dad Ritch. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re red dirt metal. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a flag we wave high. There wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a line formed for us, so I created a line and jumped to the front of that bad boy. Ride On is the best example of what we do.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe first single released from Ride On is the southern rocker Ã¢â‚¬Å“Monster In MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The band has released a lyric video for the song to give fans a small taste of what the new album sounds like. Ride On was produced by Grammy Award winning producer Skidd Mills, known for his work with Sick Puppies, Saving Abel, Devour The Day and Saliva.\n\n\n\nTexas Hippie Coalition Discography:\nPride Of Texas     2008\nRollin'     2010\nPeacemaker     2012\n\n\n\n\nLine-Up:\nBig Dad Ritch - lead vocals\nJohn Exall - bass\nCord Pool - guitar\nTimmy Braun - drums\n\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist:  Texas Hippie Coalition\nAlbum: Ride On\nGenre: Southern Stoner Metal\nYear: 2014\nCountry Of Origin: USA (Denison, TX)\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nPlaying Time: 00:36:55\nSize: 86 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
