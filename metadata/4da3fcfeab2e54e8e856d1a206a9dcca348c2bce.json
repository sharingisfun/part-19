Fellow inmate Cundo Rey, an extremely wealthy Cuban criminal, arranges for Foley's sentence to be reduced from thirty years to three months, and when Jack is released just two weeks ahead of Cundo, he agrees to wait for him in Venice Beach, California.\n\nAlso waiting for Cundo is his common-law wife, Dawn Navarro, a professional psychic with a slightly ulterior motive for staying with Cundo: namely, she wants his money. And with the arrival of Jack, she sees the perfect partner in a plan to relieve Cundo of his fortune. Cundo may be Jack's friend, but does that mean he can trust him? And can either of them trust Dawn?\n\nRoad Dogs is Elmore Leonard at his best-with his trademark tight plotting and pitch-perfect dialogueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and readers will love seeing Cundo, Jack, and Dawn back in action and working together ... or are they?\n\n\nElmore Leonard has written more than forty novels, including bestsellers Up in HoneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Room, The Hot Kid, Mr. Paradise, Tishomongo Blues, Pagan Babies, and Glitz. Many of his books have been made into movies, including Get Shorty and Out of Sight. He lives with his wife, Christine, in Bloomfield Village, Michigan.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da3fcfeab2e54e8e856d1a206a9dcca348c2bce","amp;dn":"Elmore+Leonard+-+Road+Dogs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da3fcfeab2e54e8e856d1a206a9dcca348c2bce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,163,252,254,171,46,84,232,232,86,209,162,6,169,220,202,52,140,43,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
