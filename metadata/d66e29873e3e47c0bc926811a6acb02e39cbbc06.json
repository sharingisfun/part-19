This growth, together with the foreseeable installation of many wind farms in a near future, forces the utilities to evaluate diverse aspects of the integration of wind power generation in the power systems. This book addresses a wide variety of issues regarding the integration of wind farms in power systems. It contains 10 chapters divided into three parts. The first part outlines aspects related to technical regulations and costs of wind farms. In the second part, the potential estimation and the impact on the environment of wind energy project are presented. Finally, the third part covers issues of the siting assessment of wind farms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d66e29873e3e47c0bc926811a6acb02e39cbbc06","amp;dn":"Wind+Farm+-+Technical+Regulations%2C+Potential+Estimation+and+Siti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d66e29873e3e47c0bc926811a6acb02e39cbbc06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,110,41,135,62,62,71,192,188,146,104,17,166,172,176,46,57,203,188,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
