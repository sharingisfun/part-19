This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThere is a debut song by a threesome in this countdown that has hit number one three times and each hit stayed at number one for at least three weeks (and one was titled &quot;Knock Three Times&quot;).\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Has there ever been a weekly survey where all ten of the top ten positions were occupied by British artists?&quot;\n\nCasey tells of one artist in the countdown who one summer hosted a television show, and the premise of the show was that no one had ever heard of him!\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What single in the rock era has sold the most copies?&quot;\n\nThe Captain And Tennille are in the number one position. This week they accomplish something that hasn't been done in the previous two years. Casey gives the details.\n\nOne artist in the countdown swallowed a humming-bird as a child.\n\nSorry for the few seconds missing from numbers 14, 20, and 33. I usually record three broadcasts of the same show so I don't miss anything, but this time I only got one.\n\n40: Sweet Emotion - Aerosmith\n39: Just A Little Bit Of You - Michael Jackson\n38: At Seventeen - Janis Ian\n37: Thank God I'm A Country Boy - John Denver\n36: Fight The Power - The Isley Brothers\n35: Spirit Of The Boogie - Kool &amp; The Gang\n34: 'Morning Beautiful - Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn\n33: Take Me In Your Arms - Doobie Brothers\n32: Disco Queen - Hot Chocolate\n31: It's All Down To Goodnight Vienna - Ringo Starr\n30: Cut The Cake - The Average White Band\n29: Sister Goldenhair - America\n28: Slippery When Wet - The Commodores\n27: Hey You - Bachman Turner Overdrive\n26: Every Time You Touch Me - Charley Rich\n25: Someone Saved My Life Tonight - Elton John\n24: Get Down Get Down - Joe Simon\n23: Only Women - Alice Cooper\n22: Jive Talkin' - The Bee Gees\n21: Rockford Files - Mike Post\n20: Rhinestone Cowboy - Glen Campbell\n19: I'm On Fire - Dwight Twilley Band\n18: I'm Not Lisa - Jessie Coulter\n17: Why Can't We Be Friends - War\n16: Dynamite - Bazooka\n15: Midnight Blue - Melissa Manchester\n14: Misty - Ray Stevens\n13: The Way We Were - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n12: Love Won't Let Me Wait - Major Harris\n11: Rockin' Chair - Gwenne Mcrae\n10: I'm Not In Love - 10cc\n9: When Will I Be Loved - Linda Ronstadt\n8: Swearing To God - Frankie Valli\n7: One Of These Nights - Eagles\n6: Please Mr. Please - Olivia Newton-John\n5: Magic - Pilot\n4: Wildfire - Michael Murphy\n3: Listen To What The Man Said - Paul McCartney And Wings\n2: The Hustle - Van McCoy\n1: Love Will Keep Us Together - The Captain And Tennille\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d77224039437c6ffebe8ff68579a63ea2dfb467b","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1975_July_12th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d77224039437c6ffebe8ff68579a63ea2dfb467b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,114,36,3,148,55,198,255,235,232,255,104,87,154,99,234,45,251,70,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
