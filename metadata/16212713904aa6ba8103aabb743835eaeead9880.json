After his entire battalion \n   was massacred in front of him during the final years of the \n   Vietnam War, he became consumed with guilt over their deaths, \n   and decided to leave the military for good. He just wanted to \n   live a normal life and forget his violent past...\n\n   ...But now, 10 years later, his former Commanding Officer, \n   Colonel Deckard, has tracked him down to inform him that a \n   group of POWs that were captured during the war so many years \n   ago have been found and are being used as slave labor for a \n   drug cartel in South America.\n\n   Deckard asks Magnum to accompany him as a consultant on a Top \n   Secret mission to rescue the POWs, but Magnum refuses - \n   It's not his battle anymore.\n\n   Soon after, Magnum learns from his old Army buddy, Richter, \n   that Deckard's team has not only failed their mission, but were \n   captured, and are being tortured then killed one-by-one at the\n   hands of the ruthless drug lord.\n\n   Magnum vows that he will exact his revenge on everyone in his \n   path to rescue Deckard and the POWs from the clutches of the \n   heartless drug lord... but will this one-man army be enough \n   to make it back alive?\n\n'==========================================================================='\n.========================\u001f &lt;a href=&quot; http://heavy-weapon.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://heavy-weapon.com&lt;/a&gt;  \u001f========================.\n\n   If you enjoy the book, and appreciate 80's B-movies, please support this\n   project by purchasing a legit copy from heavy-weapon.com!
