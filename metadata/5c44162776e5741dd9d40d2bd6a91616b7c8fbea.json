A moderate best-seller, there were 2,829,313 copies of Rebecca sold between 1938 and 1965[1] and the book has never gone out of print. The novel is particularly notable for the character Mrs. Danvers, the fictional estate Manderley, and its opening lines:\nLast night I dreamt I went to Manderley again . . . I came upon it suddenly; the approach masked by the unnatural growth of a vast shrub that spread in all directions . . . There was Manderley, our Manderley, secretive and silent as it had always been, the gray stone shining in the moonlight of my dream, the mullioned windows reflecting the green lawns and terrace. Time could not wreck the perfect symmetry of those walls, nor the site itself, a jewel in the hollow of a hand.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With those famous opening lines of Rebecca . . . [du Maurier] created one of the classic Gothic romances.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½[2] Rebecca &quot;remains Daphne du Maurier's best-loved novel.&quot;[3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c44162776e5741dd9d40d2bd6a91616b7c8fbea","amp;dn":"Daphne+du+Maurier+-+Rebecca.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c44162776e5741dd9d40d2bd6a91616b7c8fbea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,68,22,39,118,229,116,29,217,212,13,43,214,169,22,22,183,200,251,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
