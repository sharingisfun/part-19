This, above all, could be experienced in his sci-fi comedy series titled Captain Kremmen, which was done both as a radio series and an animated TV series. The radio series was also published in a number of LPs.\n Kenny Everett soon became one of British radio's best institutions but he also had an ability to make himself uncomfortable with a few radio executives, yet also enormously admired by many others. He died at a premature age and is very missed by many. Here in this first edition is a collection of programs from his involvement in the BBC Radio 1, 2 and 4.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0295d92bad41266e561e7a558c478f3e348a048","amp;dn":"Kenny+Everett%2C+The+Wireless+Wizard%2C+part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0295d92bad41266e561e7a558c478f3e348a048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,41,93,146,186,212,18,102,229,97,231,165,88,196,120,243,227,72,160,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
