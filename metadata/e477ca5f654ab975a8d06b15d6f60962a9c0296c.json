With this in mind, Duncan Long reveals the secrets of how to secure and create weapons and the tactics to use them when fighting almost anything imaginable from attack helicopters to tanks.\nYou'll learn how to avoid being injured by deadly chemical\nagents even if you don't have a gas mask or other protective equipment. Long gives you straight, no holds barred assessment of the shortcomings of guerrilla warfare conflicts, updates guerrilla strategies to fit today's level of technology\n, and takes a look at the historical mistakes of many rebel groups who tried to adopt conventional strategies to their movement often with the loss of many men and without winning their war.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e477ca5f654ab975a8d06b15d6f60962a9c0296c","amp;dn":"To+Break+A+Tyrants+Chains-Neo-Guerrilla+Techniques+for+Combat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e477ca5f654ab975a8d06b15d6f60962a9c0296c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,119,202,95,101,74,185,117,168,208,107,21,214,246,9,98,169,192,41,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
