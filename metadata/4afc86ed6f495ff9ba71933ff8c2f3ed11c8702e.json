Antonio borrows the money so that his friend Bessanio can travel to woo the woman he loves, Portia, whose freedom to marry is bound up in a fairy-tale decree of her father's.\r\n\r\nMy notes\r\n\r\n   A request from a friend prompted me to post this 2004 Merchant of Venice.  The setting is Germany in the Weimar Republic era of the cabaret entertainments.  \r\n\r\n   Merchant of Venice has, of course one,  of the  great &quot;trouser roles&quot; which have become famous in Shakespeare here as in the RSC &quot;Two Gentlen of Verona&quot;.  Two Gentlemen can be found in this collection in my TPB.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Please report any problem with playback.
