Peter Graves, James Daly, Bud Spencer, Testuro Tamba and Nino Castelnuovo play the quintet of the title. Caught in the middle of the 1914 Mexican Revolution, the five men pool their individual skills in hopes of incapacitating the enemy. With Mission: Impossible star Graves in the lead, it's only natural that the plan involves the &quot;impossible&quot; task of relieving a nasty general of a large gold shipment. Set in Mexico but filmed in Italy, this spaghetti western was bankrolled by MGM, the same folks who brought you the popular The Dirty Dozen and who were undoubtedly hoping that lightning would strike twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Bud Spencer, Peter Graves, James Daly\r\nDIRECTOR......: Don Taylor, Italo Zingarelli\r\nWRITERS.......: Marc Richards, Dario Argento\r\nGENRE.........: Western | Action | Adventure\r\nRATING........: 6.8/10  1,026 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064300\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 50mn\r\nSIZE..........: 1.66GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1280x720\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.78:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 2000 Kbps\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English AC3+ 2.0 Mono 160kbps\r\nSOURCE........: HDTV\r\nSUBTITLES.....: No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb203600727ef442e887321119984a086689268","amp;dn":"The.Five.Man.Army.1969.720p.HDTV.x264.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb203600727ef442e887321119984a086689268","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,178,3,96,7,39,239,68,46,136,115,33,17,153,132,160,134,104,146,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
