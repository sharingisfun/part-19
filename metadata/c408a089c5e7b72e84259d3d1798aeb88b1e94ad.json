Fuzz guitars, light harmonies, singsong melodies and hooks keep piling up until the whole thing collapses in a heap after three minutes. Unfortunately, there's nothing that matches it on Smart, Sleeper's debut album. Occasionally, Louise Wener comes up with a memorable hook, melody, or lyric, but never can quite pull them together into something as well-crafted (and sexy) as &quot;Inbetweener.&quot; Still, the flashes of inspiration scattered across Smart prove Sleeper has potential -- which they have already fulfilled once, with the single. (4/5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c408a089c5e7b72e84259d3d1798aeb88b1e94ad","amp;dn":"Sleeper+-+Smart+%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c408a089c5e7b72e84259d3d1798aeb88b1e94ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,8,160,137,197,231,183,46,132,37,157,61,23,152,174,184,139,30,148,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
