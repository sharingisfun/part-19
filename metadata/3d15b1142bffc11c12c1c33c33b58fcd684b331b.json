Minich, &quot;An A-Z Guide to Food Additives: Never Eat What You Can't Pronounce&quot;\nISBN: 1573244031 | 2009 | EPUB\n\nCochineal extract, diacetyl, teriary butylhydroquinone, BHA, HFCS, MSG--it's not just knowing how to pronounce what's in your food, it's knowing what it does and how it can affect you that matters most. But with so many processed foods on the supermarket shelves and additives showing up in the most unlikely foods, that's certainly a tall order. An A-Z Guide to Food Additives will help consumers avoid undesirable food additives and show them which additives do no harm and may even be nutritious.\n\nDesigned to fit in a purse or pocket, this little book will serve as an &quot;additive translator&quot; when navigating through the landmine field of additives or ingredients that may cause allergic reactions like headaches, fatigue, and breathing difficulties or those that cause bloating or make one hyperactive. Included are safety ratings to 300 ingredients and reference charts of such additives as those that may potentially cause cancer or allergic reactions or that should be limited for sodium-sensitive individuals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d15b1142bffc11c12c1c33c33b58fcd684b331b","amp;dn":"A-Z+Guide+to+Food+Additives%3A+Never+Eat+What+You+Can%27t+Pronounce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d15b1142bffc11c12c1c33c33b58fcd684b331b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,21,177,20,43,255,193,28,18,193,195,60,51,181,143,205,104,75,51,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
