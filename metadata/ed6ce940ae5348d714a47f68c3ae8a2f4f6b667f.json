The flames of that long-ago night still burn in her nightmares: the heat, the choking smoke, the helplessness. She can never run fast enough...\n\nNow Kerry works as an arson investigator with her evidence-sniffing dog, Sam. Together they're a great team, but her life is about to change in the time it takes to strike a match. The deadly flames of her past are back, and from out of the ashes a stranger appears. Who is Silver? And why has he chosen her in the desparate race to find a killer determined to ignite hell on earth? Kerry and Silver may not have a chance against a psychopath as coldhearted as his method is red-hot. To save themselves and the innocent lives at stake, Kerry will have to do what she hoped she'd never have to do: fight fire with fire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6ce940ae5348d714a47f68c3ae8a2f4f6b667f","amp;dn":"Iris+Johansen+-+Firestorm+-+Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6ce940ae5348d714a47f68c3ae8a2f4f6b667f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,108,233,64,174,83,72,215,20,164,127,104,195,174,138,47,79,107,102,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
