P. Galvin\r\nWiley-Blackwell | December 2015 | ISBN-10: 1119086221 | ePUB | 16.2 mb\r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by the tropics? The weather and the climates it produces across the tropical zone are significantly different from those experienced by the people living in higher latitudes, so forecasters across Europe and much of North America are unfamiliar with its effects. In this book, Jim Galvin demystifies the topic in this zone that is increasingly of interest to those studying weather and climate.\r\nThis book was written for weather forecasters, meteorology, environmental science and geography students as an introductory guide. It builds on the experience of the author, his professional experience in the World Area Forecast Centre at the Met Office, Exeter, using studies into the weather and climate seen within the tropical air mass conducted over many years. Its unique approach presents a practical approach to tropical weather studies, drawing on both academic and practical knowledge, covering air mass dynamics, seasonal changes, moist and dry weather, climate variability and human health in chapters and appendices that build up the overall picture, summarising our current state of knowledge. \r\n As an overview, it covers the broad range of effects connected with climate and weather in a straightforward way and is clearly illustrated throughout.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nJim Galvin has had a long interest in tropical meteorology. He is a Senior Operational Meteorologist in the Met Office World Area Forecast Centre in Exeter, UK and also produces the Shipping Forecast. In 2014, he became Editor of the RMetS journal Weather. He enjoys photography and singing in a choir. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nCover\r\nTitle Page\r\nAbout the Author\r\nPreface\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n1 Setting the Scene\r\n2 The Energy Balance and the Dynamics of Weather in the Tropics\r\n3 Winds, Temperature and Weather in the Tropical Zone\r\n4 The Subtropical Jet Streams\r\n5 Synoptic-scale Weather Systems\r\n6 Climate, Flora and Fauna\r\n7 Dry Environments\r\n8 Monsoons\r\n6 Climate, Flora and Fauna\r\n7 Dry Environments\r\n8 Monsoons\r\n9 Tropical Revolving Storms\r\n10 Mesoscale Weather Systems\r\n11 Forecasting Clouds and Weather\r\n12 The Variability of Weather and Climate Change in the Tropics\r\n13 Tropical Agriculture\r\n14 The Importance of the Tropical Ozone Layer\r\n15 Remote Sensing of Tropical Weather\r\n16 Tropical Weather and Health\r\n17 Conclusions and a Look to the Future\r\nAppendix 1 Observations from the Tropics\r\nAppendix 2 Named Winds of the Tropics\r\nAppendix 3 An Introduction to Cloud Types, Cloud Species and Precipitation\r\nAppendix 4 An Introduction to Meteorological Diagrams, Stability, Instability &amp; Aviation Weather Charts\r\nAppendix 5 Snow in the Desert: A Case Study\r\nAppendix 6 A Climatic Summary for Tropical Countries and States\r\nAppendix 7 Two Easterly Waves in West Africa in Summer 2009: A Case Study\r\nReferences\r\nGlossary\r\nIndex\r\n \nhttp://s13.postimg.org/jutw3jj7r/An_Introduction_to_the_Meteorology_and_Climate_o.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53135f9df147f47bc41da1a93a6706341d565862","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+the+Meteorology+and+Climate+of+the+Tropics+%28g","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53135f9df147f47bc41da1a93a6706341d565862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,19,95,157,241,71,244,123,196,29,161,169,58,103,6,52,29,86,88,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
