Lorca really takes off from the sound of earlier albums -- pushing the jazz side of the spectrum even more, and stretching out on longer tracks that have his vocals riffing a lot more than usual. Backing is relatively spare -- with some nice use of pipe organ and electric piano -- and Tim himself is playing 12-string guitar on the sessions. Tunes are all long, and feature some really haunting, echoey vocals. Bizarre but brilliant.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c5d571455d320bad3bd3f83b556ff8aa7e9cd3","amp;dn":"Tim+Buckley...Lorca+%281970%29%282011cd%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c5d571455d320bad3bd3f83b556ff8aa7e9cd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,197,213,113,69,93,50,11,173,59,211,248,59,85,111,248,170,126,156,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
