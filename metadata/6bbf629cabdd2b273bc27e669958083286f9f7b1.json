I didn't code these, I just downloaded them individually and compiled them.  This is the first and probably last time I've ever created a torrent, so If I screwed it up, I'll apologize now ^_^\n\nTales of the Wizard of Oz is a series of short cartoons from the 60's based on The Wizard of Oz (surprise!).  They ran them again in Canada in the 80's or 90's when I was a wee one, and I just loved them.  I couldn't find all of them, but here's what I could get.\n\nThey're MP4 format, the quality is pretty good though the sound is a bit muffled.  Definitely watchable, though I wouldn't try it on a 50&quot; plasma :)\n\nI'll seed as much as possible, but I don't have a dedicated machine for uploading and I have to work on this PC.\n\nHope you enjoy them as much as I did. \n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bbf629cabdd2b273bc27e669958083286f9f7b1","amp;dn":"Tales+of+the+Wizard+of+Oz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bbf629cabdd2b273bc27e669958083286f9f7b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,191,98,156,171,221,43,39,59,194,126,102,153,88,8,50,134,249,247,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
