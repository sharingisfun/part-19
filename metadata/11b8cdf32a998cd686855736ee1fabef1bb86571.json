Lane begins falling in love with Fielding Carlisle (Zachary Scott), the political protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© of the town's big-daddy sheriff Titus Semple (Sidney Greenstreet). Semple regards Lane as a gold-digging troublemaker, and does his best to break up the romance, framing her on a trumped-up morals charges and having her shipped off to prison. Once out of the &quot;joint,&quot; Lane returns to town, seeking revenge against both Semple and Carlisle.\nFlamingo Road later served as the basis for a weekly TV series; both the film and the series were based on a play by Robert and Sally Wilder.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Flamingo Road.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,198,619,892 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:34:17\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: DivX 5.x/6.x\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1493 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.203 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041373/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041373/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English and French subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by noirish, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11b8cdf32a998cd686855736ee1fabef1bb86571","amp;dn":"Michael+Curtiz+-+Flamingo+Road+%281949%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11b8cdf32a998cd686855736ee1fabef1bb86571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,184,205,243,42,153,140,214,134,133,87,54,238,31,171,239,27,184,101,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
