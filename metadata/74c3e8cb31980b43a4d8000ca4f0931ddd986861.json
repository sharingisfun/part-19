The song was ranked at number 197 in Blender magazine&amp;#039;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot;. The song is also considered to be her signature song. The song also has a parody by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic called &quot;A Complicated Song&quot;. Avril recorded this song in one take during recording sessions.\n\nThe video, directed by The Malloys, starts off with Avril asking her bandmates if they want to &quot;crash&quot; the mall. They respond with enthusiasm, and skateboard there. Some shots show Avril on guitar playing with her band in a skate park. Whilst others show her with the band at the mall playing around with clothes and jewelry, throwing things, and harassing employees. Avril&amp;#039;s brother and sister appear as extras in the video.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c3e8cb31980b43a4d8000ca4f0931ddd986861","amp;dn":"Avril+Lavigne+-+Complicated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c3e8cb31980b43a4d8000ca4f0931ddd986861","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,195,232,203,49,152,11,67,164,216,0,12,164,240,147,29,221,152,104,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
