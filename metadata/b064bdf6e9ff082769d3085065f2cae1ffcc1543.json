Heroes are dying, and cops are dying twofold. Humanity is under-powered and good people are suffering untold tragedies trying to stem the flow. Beat cop Leo Winters is one of those struggling to make a difference. And the answer just might come in the form of two lowlifes with a dark secret. A new ongoing series by award-winning author Mike Carey (X-MEN, THE UNWRITTEN) and fan-favorite artist Elena Casagrande (HULK, HACK/SLASH). SUICIDE RISK is a high octane, mind-bending series created by one of the industry's greatest storytellers.\n\nCollected Editions\n\nSuicide Risk vol. 1 (#1-4)\nSuicide Risk vol. 2 (#5-9)\nSuicide Risk vol. 3 (#10-13)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b064bdf6e9ff082769d3085065f2cae1ffcc1543","amp;dn":"Suicide+Risk+%28v01+-+v03%29+%282013+-+2014%29+%28Digital-TPB%29+%28DR+%26amp%3B+Q","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b064bdf6e9ff082769d3085065f2cae1ffcc1543","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,100,189,246,233,255,8,39,105,211,8,80,101,242,202,225,255,204,21,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
