Additional recognition was followed after a European tour with Moonspell and later with The Gathering and Seigmen. With the rest of Lacuna Coil's line-up in place -courtesy of Andrea Ferro (male vocals), Cristiano Migliore (guitars), Marco Coti Zelati (bass) and Cristiano Mozzati (drums)-the bands first full-length In A Reverie was issued in 1999.
