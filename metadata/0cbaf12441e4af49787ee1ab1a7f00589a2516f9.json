Just install and use!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTapin Radio is a simple internet radio streaming and recording tool with thousands of free online radio stations you can tune in to.\r\n\r\nThe presets in Tapin Radio include stations from all over the world, classified by region, genre and network. Theyâ€™re all accessible via the Presets menu, which can be a bit annoying sometimes â€“ especially when dealing with lists of hundreds of stations. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s probably best to open them from the search tool.\r\n\r\nBesides playing streamed music, Tapin Radio also records it to your hard drive in several formats (MP3, OGG, WMA and AAC), by simply pressing the Record button. Other tools included in Tapin Radio are a sleep timer and an auto volume feature.\r\n\r\nBoth the player and the recorder in Tapin Radio offer very basic functionality, as well as a simple interface design. The program doesnâ€™t include any documentation, but then again, it doesnâ€™t really need it. Some users might consider the app a little too pared down, but others will surely appreciate the simplicity.\r\n\r\nTapin Radio lets you listen to free internet radio stations from all over the world and record them to your hard drive.\r\n \r\nRecent changes\r\nUpdated: Updated language files\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTapin Radio supports the following formats\r\n\r\nMP3, WMA, AAC, OGG\r\n\r\n\r\nReality Ascent by Dragan Glavasic\r\nWAKE UP!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2:19 AM 8/31/2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cbaf12441e4af49787ee1ab1a7f00589a2516f9","amp;dn":"Tapin+Radio+1.60.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cbaf12441e4af49787ee1ab1a7f00589a2516f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,186,241,36,65,228,175,73,120,126,225,171,26,127,0,88,154,37,22,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
