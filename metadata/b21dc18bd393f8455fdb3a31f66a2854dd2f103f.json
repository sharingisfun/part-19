Carrol Naish in Main Roles, Opens at Capitol\nBy BOSLEY CROWTHER\nEven though M.-G.-M.'s &quot;Black Hand,&quot; which came to the Capitol on Saturday, might cynically be designated as just a period gangster film, it has more to recommend it than a good, adventurous gangster plot. It has, in its picturization of New York's &quot;little Italy&quot; back in the unrestricted period of this century's first decade, some rather affecting indications of the crowded and troubled world, novel and mystifying, in which this city's Italian immigrants lived. And it has some quite colorful acting by a generally well directed cast, of which the bestÃ¢â‚¬â€and the mostÃ¢â‚¬â€is contributed by Gene Kelly and J. Carrol Naish.\n\nIn his first &quot;straight&quot; role in a pictureÃ¢â‚¬â€away from dancing and singing, that isÃ¢â‚¬â€Mr. Kelly is eminently forceful as a young Italian-American who aspires to help his neighbors rid themselves of the bands of terrorists and extortionists which are fearfully known as &quot;the Black Hand.&quot; And Mr. Naish is equally impressive as an Italian detective on the New York police force who joins in the youthful zealot's campaign to wipe out this terrifying scourge.\n\nOne might tactfully question the simplicity of the plot, prepared by Luther Davis, as a wee bit theatrical. The penetrations of the Black Hand, as we indirectly recall, were considerably more complicated than they are represented in this film, which brings the whole thing down to the level of the innocents versus the gangs. And the ultimate tactic for discovering and beating the gangsters in this case is a little too easy and obvious for serious acceptability.\n\nBut the story and the direction of Richard Thorp have made much and well of opportunities for showing the nature and behavior of poor people in terror's grip. And the simple, human aspects of kidnappings, bombings and relations with the police are pathetically and humorously indicated. Herein lies the character of the film. Good in roles of lesser importance are Teresa Celli as the hero's sweetheart, Frank Puglia as a victim of the Black Hand, Carlo Tricoli as a treacherous &quot;innocent,&quot; and Carl Milletaire as a dandified thug. Numerous other performers fill bit and background roles most colorfully. A very good production rounds out this picture's qualities.\n\nIn the real-life incidents upon which this film is based, it was the Mafia, not the Black Hand, who functioned as the villain. Even in 1950, however, Hollywood had to tread gingerly whenever dealing with big-time crime; it was easier (and safer) to go after a &quot;dead&quot; criminal organization than a &quot;live&quot; one.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.37gb\nDuration.... 01:31:59\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 540\nData Rate.... 2016kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n2 Channel stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b21dc18bd393f8455fdb3a31f66a2854dd2f103f","amp;dn":"Black+Hand+1950+DvdRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b21dc18bd393f8455fdb3a31f66a2854dd2f103f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,29,193,139,211,147,248,69,95,219,58,49,246,106,40,84,221,47,16,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
