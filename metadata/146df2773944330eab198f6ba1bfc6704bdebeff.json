Half-Egyptian, full of nervous habits, raised by a single mother, owner of a name that no one can pronounce -- Khosi has never quite managed to fit in. But when a mysterious stranger arrives in town (and Khosi's longtime love uses Butte's annual festival, Evel Knievel Days, as a time to announce her impending marriage to someone else), Khosi takes his first daredevil like risk, and travels to Egypt to find his father -- and a connection to his heritage. \n   What he discovers, in Cairo, is much more startling than he'd imagined it could be. The city is a thrilling mix of contradictions -- and locating his father turns out to be the easy part. Through mistaken identity, delicious food, and near tragedy, Khosi and his parents rediscover what it means to be connected to each other, to a family, and to a culture.\n   The timely story of a young man searching for his roots, and along the way finding his identity, Evel Knievel Days is KhosiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charming and funny journey to learn where he came from, and who he is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:146df2773944330eab198f6ba1bfc6704bdebeff","amp;dn":"Evel+Knievel+Days+by+Pauls+Toutonghi+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"146df2773944330eab198f6ba1bfc6704bdebeff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,109,242,119,57,68,51,14,171,25,143,107,161,191,198,112,75,222,190,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
