The band's rise was indebted to the aggressive rap-rock movement made popular by the likes of Korn and Limp Bizkit, a movement that paired grunge's alienation with a bold, buzzing soundtrack. Linkin Park added a unique spin to that formula, however, focusing as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda as the band's muscled instrumentation, which layered DJ effects atop heavy, processed guitars. While the group's sales never eclipsed those of its tremendously successful debut, Hybrid Theory, few alt-metal bands rivaled Linkin Park during the band's heyday.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t23605-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.87% CDDA &amp; 99.87% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.The Catalyst\n02.New Divide\n03.What I've Done\n04.Numb\n05.One Step Closer\n06.Leave Out All The Rest\n07.Somewhere I Belong\n08.Given Up\n09.Points Of Authority\n10.No More Sorrow\n11.Breaking The Habit\n12.Runaway\nFrom You\n14.In The End\n15.Shadow Of The Day\n16.A Place For My Head\n17.Faint\n18.Papercut\n19.Bleed It Out\n20.Crawling\n21.From The Inside\n22.Easier To Run\n23.Points Of Authority/99 Problems/One Step Closer (Feat.
