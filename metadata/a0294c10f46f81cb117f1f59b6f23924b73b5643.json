She was born in the town of Davlekanovo in Bashkiria and grew up in Moscow where she took a degree in genetics from the Moscow State University.\n\nUlitskaya's first novella, Sonechka, published in Novy Mir in 1992, almost immediately became extremely popular, and was shortlisted for the Russian Booker Award. Today her writing is much admired by the general reading public and critics in Russia and many other countries. A number of interlinked themes dominate her works: the need for religious and ethnic tolerance; the problem of the intelligentsia in Soviet culture; gender and family issues; everyday life as a literary subject; and new images of the body (the sexual body, handicapped body, etc.). In 2006 she published Daniel Stein, Translator, a novel dealing with the Holocaust and the need for reconciliation between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Her works have been translated into several languages and received several international and Russian literary awards, including the Russian Booker for Kukotsky's Case (2001). (Ulitskaya was the first woman to receive this distinguished prize.) She regularly publishes commentary on social issues and is actively involved in philanthropic projects increasing access to literature. In Germany her novels have been added to bestseller lists thanks to the featuring of her works on a television program hosted by literary critic Elke Heidenreich. A number of her novels and short stories have been translated into English.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and  they are in ePUB format:\n\n* Medea and Her Children (1996) - Lyudmila Ulitskaya, translated from the Russian by Arch Tait\n\n* The Funeral Party (1997) - Lyudmila Ulitskaya, translated from the Russian by Cathy Porter, translation edited by Arch tait\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyudmila_Ulitskaya&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyudmila_Ulitskaya&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/this-week-in-fiction-lyudmila-ulitskaya&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/this-week-in-fiction-lyudmila-ulitskaya&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/17/lyudmila-ulitskaya-dissident-putin-interview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/17/lyudmila-ulitskaya-dissident-putin-interview&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rbth.com/literature/2013/06/30/on_being_chosen_the_great_writer_ludmila_ulitskaya_speaks_up_27549.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rbth.com/literature/2013/06/30/on_being_chosen_the_great_writer_ludmila_ulitskaya_speaks_up_27549.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0294c10f46f81cb117f1f59b6f23924b73b5643","amp;dn":"Ludmila+Ulitskaya+-+Russian+Author+%282+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0294c10f46f81cb117f1f59b6f23924b73b5643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,41,76,16,244,111,129,203,17,127,31,89,182,242,57,36,183,59,86,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
