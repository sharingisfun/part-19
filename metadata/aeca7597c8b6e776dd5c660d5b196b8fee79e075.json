This is a time machine traveling you back 25 years. This song was hugely popular but as far as Big Papi can see gets absolutely zero airplay these days. If you were in the clubs during that time you will go &quot;Ahhhhhhhh I love this song!!!&quot;\n\nOh crap it fades into the next track so this song ends rather abruptly!!!. The entire CD will be upped tomorrow so check back then. If you want this as a stand-alone single you'll need the radio version or will need to fade this one out yourself.\n\nThe CD is not bad.....not bad at all...\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n[center]\n\n[b]Soho - Hippychick[/b] \n\nIt's hard to tell you how I feel without hurting you\nSo try to think about yourself the way that I see you\nYour life revolves around a force of oppression\nAnd I won't deal with true blue devils of correction\n\nGot no flowers for your gun, no hippychick\nWon't make love to change your mind, no hippychick\nNo hippychick, no hip hip hip hip hip\n\nToday we'll sit here drinking coffee in your incident room\nTonight you'll close the door and lock me in that bare bulb gloom\nLove, it ain't something riding on a motorbike\nAnd love, I stopped loving you since the miners' strike\n\nGot no flowers for your gun, no hippychick\nWon't make love to change your mind, no hippychick\nNo hippychick, no hip hip hip hip hip\n\nIt's hard, it's hard\nIt's hard, it's hard\nNo hippychick, no hip hip hip hip hip\nNo hippychick, no hip hip hip hip hip\nNo hippychick, no hip hip hip hip hip\nNo hippychick","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeca7597c8b6e776dd5c660d5b196b8fee79e075","amp;dn":"Soho+-+Hippychick+-+1990+Electronic+Dance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeca7597c8b6e776dd5c660d5b196b8fee79e075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,202,117,151,200,182,231,118,221,92,102,13,91,25,107,143,238,121,224,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
