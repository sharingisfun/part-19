The Houdini 10 will fuckup the older version anyway. Also uninstall the sesi folder (/Library/Preferences/sesi).ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Install Houdini 10. But donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t open that yet.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Go to:ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨/Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨And put the sesinetd in the trash. I will ask to authenticate, so type your password.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Now you can drop the cracked sesinetd inside the same folder:ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨/Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨It will ask again to authenticate, so type your password one more time.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Now you need to do the chmod operation. Type:ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨chmod +w /Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨chmod +r /Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨chmod +x /Library/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/10.0.249.3/Resources/houdini/sbinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨You donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to type all the pathway just drag and drop your sesinetd and it will do the rest for you.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Now WATCH OUT!!! You need to RESTART your machine!!! VERY IMPORTANT!!!!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨OkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ After the restart. Open the License Administrator.app (inside the installed Houdini folder)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Also open the keygen.exe (you can you Darwine app to open .exe inside mac)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Type your server name and server code. (You can find it at the License Administrator app. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLicense server hostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLicense server codeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ inside the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œServer InformationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Tab)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨And press generate license.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Go back to License Administrator.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨(File/Manually enter keys)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨And place your key in there.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨It will work now!!!
