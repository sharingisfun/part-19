She is saved when Dutch policeman Peter \n\nJongman, who is plagued by his failure to save his \n\nfiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e from death at the hands of the Nazis, \n\naccidentally kills Thorens. Jongman then decides to \n\natone for the past by seeing that Lisa reaches \n\nPalestine. He gets them both work on a Dutch barge \n\nowned by Captain Brandt, who takes them to Tangiers. \n\nThere, a flamboyant smuggler, Van der Pink, arranges \n\npassage for them to Palestine. During Lisa's medical \n\nexamination, Peter discovers that the Nazis had used \n\nher for surgical experimentation, a series of \n\noperations which have made her incapable of being a \n\nwife or mother. Peter also learns that he is wanted \n\nback in London for questioning about the death of \n\nThorens. Since he knows the British are planning to \n\nblock Lisa's illegal entry into Palestine, he makes a \n\ndeal with one of their agents: if Lisa is allowed to \n\nenter the country, he will surrender himself to the \n\nBritish police. Once he has accomplished his mission \n\nand Lisa is delivered into the hands of the Haganah, \n\nPeter leaves to keep his rendezvous with the British \n\nauthorities. \n \n\nCast &amp; Crew\nPhilip Dunne Director \nStephen Boyd as Peter Jongman\nDolores Hart as Lisa Held\nLeo McKern as Brandt\nHugh Griffith as Van der Pink\nDonald Pleasence as Sergeant Wolters\nHarry Andrews as Ayoob\nRobert Stephens as Dickens\nMarius Goring as Thorens\nFinlay Currie as De Kooi\nHarold Goldblatt as Dr. Mitropoulous\nNeil McCallum as Browne \n\nRelease Date Jan 1962\n\nColor/BW Color (DeLuxe)\n\nSound Mono\n\nProduction Dates not available \n\nAlternate Title &quot;The Inspector&quot;\n\nDuration 112 mins\n\nPremiere Information\nNew York opening: 24 May 1962 \n\nDistribution Company\nTwentieth Century--Fox Film Corp. \n\nProduction Company\nRed Lion Productions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae376ce9e18ae93702e2215a48c37af61da6e851","amp;dn":"Lisa+%28aka+The+Inspector%29+LBX+1962+Stephen+Boyd%2C+Dolores+Hart.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae376ce9e18ae93702e2215a48c37af61da6e851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,55,108,233,225,138,233,55,2,226,33,90,72,195,122,246,29,166,232,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
