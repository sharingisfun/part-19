Although the action\ninvolves real people and events at the court of Henri II\n[1558], in reality the work is a thinly veiled satire on\nthe court of Louis XIV, and features the same wickedness\nthat makes 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' so compelling.\n\nYoung woman attends at court to find a husband. Having\ndone so she becomes prey to gossip when she falls in\nlove with another. Though chaste, she confesses all to\nher husband who frets and takes ill.\n\nLast summer Sarkozy was accused of philistinism, and sparked\nof public readings of the novel, when he criticised the French\ncivil service entrance exams for including questions about it. \n\nCast\nLa Princesse de ClÃƒÂ¨ves - Melody Grove\nHer Mother - Candida Benson\nLe Prince de ClÃƒÂ¨ves - Liam Brennan\nNemours - Robin Laing\nGuise - Laurie Brown\nMarie Stuart, Queen of Scots - Meg Fraser\nChorus 1 - Irene MacDougall\nChorus 2 - Ralph Riach\nChrous 3 - Crawford Logan\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d956dcc886c1999e7f372f812b3178ce594dbc28","amp;dn":"BBC+R3+-+Madame+de+Lafayette%5C%27s+%5C%27La+Princesse+de+Cl%C3%A8ves%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d956dcc886c1999e7f372f812b3178ce594dbc28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,86,220,200,134,193,153,158,127,55,47,129,43,49,120,206,89,77,188,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
