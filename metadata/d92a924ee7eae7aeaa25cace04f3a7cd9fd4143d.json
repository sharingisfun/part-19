It is intended to be a text that you can use throughout medical school and refer back to when questions arise during residency and, eventually, practice. Medical Genetics is written as a narrative where each chapter builds upon the foundation laid by previous ones. Chapters can also be used as stand-alone learning aids for specific topics. \n\nTaken as a whole, this timely book delivers a complete overview of genetics in medicine. You will find in-depth, expert coverage of such key topics as: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The structure and function of genes \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Cytogenetics \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mendelian inheritance \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mutations \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Genetic testing and screening \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Genetic therapies \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Disorders of organelles \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Key genetic diseases, disorders, and syndromes\n\nEach chapter of Medical Genetics is logically organized into three sections: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Background and Systems Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Includes the basic genetic principles needed to understand the medical application \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Medical Genetics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Contains all the pertinent information necessary to build a strong knowledge base for being successful on every step of the USMLE \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Case Study Application Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Incorporates case study examples to illustrate how basic principles apply to real-world patent care\n\nToday, with every component of health care delivery requiring a working knowledge of core genetic principles, Medical Genetics is a true must-read for every clinician.\n\n\nBy G.
