Davis comes the deeply compassionate story of what happens when we view our neighbors as Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe OtherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as well as the transcendent power of unlikely friendships.\n\nThe God-fearing townspeople of Gideon shun the Erskine Clan, who live on North Mountain, and ignore the rampant child abuse and violence. On the mountain, twenty-one-year old Albert Erskine dreams of a better and safer life. In town, young Ivy Evans is relentlessly bullied by her classmates. Though her father, Tom Evans, is a well-liked local, his troubled marriage to a restless outsider is a source of gossip. As rumors and innuendo about the Evans family spread, Ivy seeks refuge in Dorothy Carlisle, an independent-minded widow who runs a local antique store. When Albert ventures down from the mountain and seizes on the Evans' family crisis as an opportunity to befriend Ivy's vulnerable teenage brother Bobby it sets in motion a chain of events which will change everything. Inspired by a true story.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6468d3c11eff1967c02ea46bf966fbc3c422648","amp;dn":"Our+Daily+Bread+by+Lauren+B.+Davis+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6468d3c11eff1967c02ea46bf966fbc3c422648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,70,141,60,17,239,241,150,124,2,234,70,191,150,111,188,60,66,38,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
