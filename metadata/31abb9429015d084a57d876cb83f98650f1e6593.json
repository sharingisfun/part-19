His adored big brother, Jonatan, calms him down and starts telling him about life after death. In the afterlife, all men will go to a land on the other side of the stars, known as Nangijala, where they're still in &quot;the campfires and storytelling times&quot;.\n\nSome time later a fire spreads throughout their home, and both of them dies.\nJonatan attempts to rescue his little brother by carrying him on his back and jumping out the window. Jonatan is injured in the fall and dies. Karl is left alone, and starts to wonder if the story about Nangijala is really true. A white pigeon appears one night on his window sill, and Karl interprets it as a confirmation that it is.\n\nIn Nangijala, a land in &quot;the campfires and storytelling days&quot;, the brothers experience adventures. Together with a resistance group they lead the struggle against the evil Tengil, who rules with the aid of the fearsome fire-breathing dragon Katla.\n\nThis is a wonderful but sad film, many of the movie themes are unusually dark and heavy for the children's movie genre. Disease, death, tyranny, betrayal and rebellion are some of the dark themes that permeate the story.\nReleased 1977, so please, the effect arenÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t to be compared with new films.\n \n\n\nENJOY AND DON'T FORGET, SAY THANKS AND SEED.\n\n\n\n\nIMDB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075790/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075790/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31abb9429015d084a57d876cb83f98650f1e6593","amp;dn":"The+Brothers+Lionheart+-+English+Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31abb9429015d084a57d876cb83f98650f1e6593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,171,185,66,144,21,208,132,165,125,135,108,184,63,152,101,15,30,101,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
