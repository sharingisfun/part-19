The film was shot at the prison where Paradjanov was confined, using contemporary prisoners as extras, and it might be said that the documentary and poetic-symbolic aspects of this movie are equally germane to its overall impact. Three days before his sentence is to end, a prisoner (Victor Solovyov) escapes and hides out inside a giant hammer and sickle that borders the prison grounds, where he is discovered and nursed back to health by a beautiful woman (Liudmyla Yefymenko, Illyenko's wife) who becomes his lover. One of the first independent Soviet productions, partially financed in Sweden and Canada, the film tells its story with a minimum of dialogue and very striking imagery. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader\n\n    From Yuri Ilyenko's letter to a friend, Marko Stech:\n    &quot;As you undoubtedly know, the art of cinema has no appropriate rendering in the verbal realm of expression. Such in the case with any form of visual art. Hence, my subjugated mind seeks remedy in an image. An image is wiser than a word because it always represents a prophecy that has not as yet bound itself with words. I made this film because it was impossible for me not to have made it. it is about escape - about a prisoner. I myself have always felt a prisoner in a vast zone, together with my entire nation. Escape is the last, desperate hope. Such is also an escape into art.&quot;\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://board.freakyflicks.org/viewtopic.php?id=388&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://board.freakyflicks.org/viewtopic.php?id=388&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile Info:\n\nNot my rip/encode, thanks to the original uploader, somewhere, sometimes..\nThanks to the one who did the subs too!\n\n    File Size (in bytes) ............................: 730,660,864 bytes\n    Runtime ............................................: 1:29:33\n\n    Video Codec ...................................: XviD 1.0.3\n    Frame Size ......................................: 640x448 (AR: 1.429)\n    FPS .................................................: 25.000\n    Video Bitrate ...................................: 950 kb/s\n    Bits per Pixel ...................................: 0.133 bpp\n    B-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\n    Audio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n    Sample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\n    Audio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\n    No. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ***********************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
