The music on this compact digital disc was recorded on an analog medium. It was attempted to preserve, as closely as possible, the sound of the original recording. Because of its high resolution, however, the compact disc can reveal limitations and age of the source as well as artifacts of the editing and re-mastering.\n\nThis is a Crepusculaire release\nCPCA CD 006\n4025230550060\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nEach of the following TPB trackers are supported.
