The Ninth Edition further emphasizes this with the addition of new Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why This Is ImportantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sections throughout the text. Real-life and up-to-date examples motivate the topics throughout, and a wide range of exercises help students to develop their problem-solving and critical thinking skills.\n \nAngel, Abbott, and Runde present the material in a way that is clear and accessible to non-math majors. The text includes a wide variety of math topics, with contents that are flexible for use in any one- or two-semester Liberal Arts Math course.\n\n=====================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb316561b54ec277eda0226b91a6567feb98418f","amp;dn":"A+Survey+Of+Mathematics+9th+Angel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb316561b54ec277eda0226b91a6567feb98418f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,49,101,97,181,78,194,119,237,160,34,107,145,166,86,127,235,152,65,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
