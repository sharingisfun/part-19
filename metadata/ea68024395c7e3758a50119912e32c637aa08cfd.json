Mission, Character, Service, and Getting the Job Done by Donovan Campbell\n\nWhat does it take to be a great leader? In a word: character. This unique book by decorated U.S. Marine Corps veteran Donovan Campbell, the New York Times bestselling author of Joker One, draws on his years of training and combat experience to reveal the specific virtues that underpin effective leadershipÃ¢â‚¬â€and how anyone can stand up, serve others, and make a difference in the world by bringing out the best in a team.\n\nThe LeaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Code is a practical action plan that can be applied to any situation in which exemplary leadership is required, whether that be at home or in the workplace. Moreover, The LeaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Code unpacks the military servant-leader modelÃ¢â‚¬â€a leader must take care of his mission first, his team second, and himself a distant thirdÃ¢â‚¬â€and explains why this concept of self-sacrifice is so needed in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world. Focusing on the development of character as the foundation of servant-leadership, Campbell identifies characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s six key attributes: humility, excellence, kindness, discipline, courage, and wisdom. \n\nThen, drawing on lessons from his time in the Corps and stories from history, Scripture, and American business, he shows us how to develop those virtues in order to take the helm with confidence, conviction, and a passion to bring out the best in others.\n\nBeing a leader is about being worthy of being followed. True leaders, Campbell argues, foster compassion for others and they pursue excellence in all that they do. They are humble and know how to self-correct. CampbellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exploration of these vital qualities is wide-ranging, as he takes us from the boardrooms of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful companies to the Infantry Officer Course, the intense twelve-week training gauntlet that Marines use to prepare their leaders to sacrifice themselves for the welfare of others.\n\nWith faith in our political and business leaders at an all-time low, America is in the midst of a crisis of trust. Yet public opinion polls show that there is one institution that still commands widespread respect because of its commitment to character and sacrifice: the United States military. The LeaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Code shows that this same servant-leader model can help us all become our best selvesÃ¢â‚¬â€and provide a way forward for our nation.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Educational | Buisiness | Self Help | Leadership","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea68024395c7e3758a50119912e32c637aa08cfd","amp;dn":"The+Leader%27s+Code+by+Donovan+Campbell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea68024395c7e3758a50119912e32c637aa08cfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,104,2,67,149,199,227,117,138,80,17,153,18,227,44,99,122,160,140,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
