But the group's studio mastery sometimes overshadows the fact that it was also a live juggernaut -- so don't overlook the outstanding live and studio album from 1979, 8:30. This was a rare quartet version of Weather Report, with co-leaders in keyboardist Joe Zawinul and saxophonist Wayne Shorter. The bassist was the inimitable Jaco Pastorius, the drummer a young Peter Erskine. Pastorius is otherworldly on early gems like &quot;Black Market,&quot; the breakneck &quot;Teen Town,&quot; and his solo showcase, &quot;Slang&quot; (in which he quotes Jimi Hendrix' &quot;Third Stone From the Sun&quot;). Shorter is most involved on the CD's slower pieces like &quot;A Remark You Made,&quot; &quot;In a Silent Way,&quot; and his own solo piece, &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot;; Zawinul and Erskine shine on the swinging version of &quot;Birdland&quot; and roller coaster ride of &quot;Badia/Boogie Woogie Waltz Medley.&quot; Four studio tracks (composing what was side four of the original album version) close 8:30 with a flourish -- and some surprises. Pastorius duets on drums with Zawinul on the brief title track, then plays double drums with Erskine (as Erich Zawinul plays percussion) on the playful &quot;Brown Street.&quot; Zawinul then throws a curve with &quot;The Orphan,&quot; dueting with Shorter as ten members of the West Los Angeles Christian Academy Children's Choir chant harmonies. The saxophonist gets in the last word, though, with his burning composition &quot;Sightseeing&quot; -- on which he plays unison lines with Zawinul over Pastorius' rare walking bassline and Erskine's most aggressive drumming. A future jazz standard ending one of this band's standard-setting CDs. \n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
