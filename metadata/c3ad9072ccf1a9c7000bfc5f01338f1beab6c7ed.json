Ed will call on all of his expertise in extreme terrains and climates to uncover the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  West Papua \r\nEd sets out to find the cause of some mysterious white lines, covering a vast area in an uninhabited expanse of swamp on Kimaam Island - also known as Yos Sudarso - in West Papua. Helped by a team of travelling missionaries, he gets close to his target before having to venture alone into the swamp. It's slow progress and, as Ed closes in his adventure takes a totally unexpected turn when he finds a group of indigenous people living in what was thought to be an uninhabitable swamp. As the mystery deepens, Ed is led to a settlement no outsiders have ever visited before. Among the villagers he undergoes a tribal initiation, and discovers a startling insight into an ancient way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Into-the-Unknown-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Into-the-Unknown-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/Into-the-Unknown-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Into-the-Unknown-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Into-the-Unknown-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Into-the-Unknown-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Into-the-Unknown-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Into-the-Unknown-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Into-the-Unknown-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Into-the-Unknown-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Into-the-Unknown-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Into-the-Unknown-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/Into-the-Unknown-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Into-the-Unknown-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Into-the-Unknown-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Into-the-Unknown-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3192 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 5\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.discoveryuk.com/shows/ed-stafford-into-the-unknown/episodes/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3ad9072ccf1a9c7000bfc5f01338f1beab6c7ed","amp;dn":"Ed+Stafford+Into+The+Unknown+Series+1+1of5+West+Papua+720p+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3ad9072ccf1a9c7000bfc5f01338f1beab6c7ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,173,144,114,204,241,169,199,0,11,252,95,1,51,143,27,234,182,199,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
