Enjoy.\n\nNow being seedboxed.\n\nWill be on DailyMotion off and on as it gets taken down.\n\n========================================================\n\nAWD Porsche 964 track car? Yes. Definitely.\n\nPublished on Aug 12, 2014\nThe sound of this car is phenomenal. \n\nWhen you think of of a classic Porsche, you predictably think, &quot;911&quot;, but you probably don't think &quot;964&quot;, or &quot;AWD&quot;. Certainly not if you want to build a track car. \n\nBut if you're Larry Kosilla, who has worked himself ragged for years, and lives in the northeastern U.S., you don't want to own a dream car that you can't drive when it's snowy out. He wanted something he can drive any time he wants, and take to the track, anytime he wants. \n\nThe result of his idea is astounding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d3c8333fa7c84256d779055d60521f1f355203","amp;dn":"Drive+Plus+-+AWD+Porsche+964+track+car_+Yes.+Definitely.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d3c8333fa7c84256d779055d60521f1f355203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,211,200,51,63,167,200,66,86,215,121,5,93,96,82,31,31,53,82,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
