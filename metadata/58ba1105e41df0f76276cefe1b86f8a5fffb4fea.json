Released on 22 October 2001 in the UK, and is the band's last album. It reached number 6 in the UK album charts, with a total chart stay of only three weeks.[1]\nIt is notable for being produced by Scott Walker, whose own album 'Til The Band Comes In is mocked in the lyrics of the song &quot;Bad Cover Version&quot;.
