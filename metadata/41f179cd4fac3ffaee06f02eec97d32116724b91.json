Read how it all begins in this short story, The First.\n\nIt's been just over a year since Edmund Blithe died, and just over a month since his fiancÃƒÂ©e, Emily, stopped wearing her engagement ring. Emily has finally begun to move onÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Until Edmund mysteriously and inexplicably returns, sending the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€and EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â€into a tailspin.\n\nEdmund is only just the beginning. Around the world, people's loved ones are returning from beyond, seeking only to reenter the lives they left behind. As the world dives deep into uncertainty, Emily and Edmund are determined to find their way back to one anotherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦even if it means risking everything.\n\nThe reappearances continue in The Sparrow, and look for The Returned from Harlequin MIRA, a moving tale of a family given a second chance at life and a world where nothingÃ¢â‚¬â€not even deathÃ¢â‚¬â€is certain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41f179cd4fac3ffaee06f02eec97d32116724b91","amp;dn":"The+First+-+%28The+Returned+0.5%29+-+Jason+Mott.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41f179cd4fac3ffaee06f02eec97d32116724b91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,241,121,205,79,172,63,250,238,6,240,46,236,151,211,33,22,114,75,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
