I Can't Quit You\r\n2. I Gotta Move\r\n3. Dazed and Confused\r\n4. How Many More Times (fades around 2:15)\r\n\r\nSource: \r\nIncomplete excellent professional pre-FM soundboard radio recording. 22 minutes.\r\n\r\nDetails: \r\nSuperb quality and spectrum. Very clear and well balanced but a bit bass heavy. \r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThis show wasn't broadcast live as it was happening. It was broadcast some days after the original show taking place, and as of yet, the date of the original broadcast is unknown. The Swedish radio station secured the rights to broadcast only a part of the show from Peter Grant, who thus gave them what we have today.\r\n\r\nA very powerful and compact show. Jimmy breaks a string after the first song so the band ad-libs a one-time only I Gotta Move with guitar, bass, harmonica and vocals while Jimmy restrings. A unique performance! The show is very good and strong, albeit too short!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b88e07166c87993f6d6e815f99bd29aeda952b8","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1969.03.14+Stockholm%2C+Sweden+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b88e07166c87993f6d6e815f99bd29aeda952b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,136,224,113,102,200,121,147,246,214,232,21,249,155,210,154,237,169,82,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
