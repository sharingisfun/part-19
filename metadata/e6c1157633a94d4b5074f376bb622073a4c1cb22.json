It has the original gameplay, Mercenaries mode, Assignment Ada, and Separate Ways. 4 different games to play. the GC version only had some of that. it was missing the &quot;Separate Ways&quot; adventure\n\nthe game has and extra unlockable gun, along with all of the other guns. this extra gun is a HUGE ASS LAZER called the P.R.L. 412. this will kill any enemy, boss, etc with only 1 shot.\nthen is has all the other unlockable content from the other console releases too.\n--------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nRESIDENT EVIL 4:\n*****GAMEPLAY*****\nThe player controls Leon S. Kennedy from a third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective during a mission to rescue the daughter of the President of the United States, Ashley Graham. The gameplay focuses on action and shootouts involving crowds of enemies in large open areas. The camera is focused behind Leon, and it zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon. The addition of a laser sight adds a new depth to the aiming, allowing the player to aim in various directions and easily change their placement at any time. Bullets now affect the enemies specifically where they are shot: shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, while shots to the arms can cause them to drop their weapons.\n\nAnother new aspect of Resident Evil 4 is the inclusion of context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, the player can interact with aspects of their environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, or dodging an enemy attack. There are also dynamic cut scenes, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss battles, where the player must avoid one-hit kill attacks. The Wii version expanded on this concept slightly by including a quick Wii Remote shake as a possible context sensitive action.\n\nCapcom added new content made specifically for the PlayStation 2, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a minigame which revolves around Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to Albert Wesker, a former member of STARS, who is now attempting to revive Umbrella. &quot;Ada's Report&quot;, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions included the minigame &quot;The Mercenaries&quot;, new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new unlockable weapons and a Movie Browser.\n\nThe main enemies are parasitically-controlled humans referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Significantly smarter and quicker than the zombies from previous games, Ganados are a very different sort of foe. These new enemies dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other. Once simple farmers, these Ganados are the product of an infestation of Las Plagas (&quot;The Plague&quot; in Spanish).\n\nThe inventory system of the game features a grid system, represented by an attache case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition and healing items are kept in the case, while key items are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a wandering merchant that appears in various locations throughout the game. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages. One major goal for the game design was to increase weapon diversity to improve player freedom and gameplay depth.\n\n*****PLOT*****\nIn 2004, the Umbrella Corporation's secret activities within Raccoon City have become a public affair. Following an investigation conducted by the U.S. government, several Umbrella officials are implicated and prosecuted. The government indefinitely suspends Umbrella's business, bankrupting the company.\n\nLeon S. Kennedy was recruited by the U.S. Secret Service after they learned of his actions in Raccoon City. Leon is sent on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham, the President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. Leon travels to a rural village in Europe, where he encounters a horde of violent villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados (&quot;The Enlightened Ones&quot; in Spanish), the cult that has kidnapped Ashley.\n\nDuring the course of the mission, Leon is injected with a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas. He is also reunited with Ada Wong, a woman from his past, and Jack Krauser, one of Leon's former comrades from his years of training, who was thought to be dead. He also meets Luis Sera, a former Los Illuminados researcher who aids Leon on his mission, but is later murdered by Osmund Saddler, the leader of the Los Illuminados cult. By examining Sera's notes, Leon discovers that Los Illuminados gained control of their subjects with Las Plagas. Their plan is to inject Ashley with a parasite, and then allow her to return to the U.S., where she can infect government officials.\n\nAfter Saddler discovers that Leon has rescued Ashley, he commands his subjects to use any means to recover her. Meanwhile, after defeating the village chief, Bitores Mendez, Leon and Ashley take refuge inside the castle of castellan, Ramon Salazar. Ashley begins to cough up blood, indicating the slow maturation of the Plaga egg in her bloodstream. Distressed by this, she runs off. Leon eventually finds her, but she is later captured again. Leon then battles his way through the castle to find Salazar, only to learn that Ashley has been taken to a nearby island research facility. After numerous altercations with Saddler's forces, Leon is able to rescue Ashley, remove the Plagas from both of their bodies and defeat Saddler with Ada's assistance. Leon recovers a vial containing a Plagas sample from Saddler's body, but Ada forces him to give it to her at gunpoint. She then escapes from the complex in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski.\n\nENJOY, and please seed\n--------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6c1157633a94d4b5074f376bb622073a4c1cb22","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+4+1.1.0+with+Enhanced+Texture+Patch+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6c1157633a94d4b5074f376bb622073a4c1cb22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,193,21,118,51,169,77,75,80,116,243,118,187,98,32,115,164,193,203,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
