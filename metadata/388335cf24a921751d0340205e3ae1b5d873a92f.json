Basic mathematical theories are explained in the simplest of terms, supported by practical engineering examples and applications from a wide variety of engineering disciplines, to ensure the reader can relate the theory to actual engineering practice. This extensive and thorough topic coverage makes this an ideal text for a range of university degree modules, Foundation Degrees, and HNC/D units.\n\nAn established text which has helped many thousands of students to gain exam success, now in its fifth edition Higher Engineering Mathematics has been further extended with new topics to maximise the book\\'s applicability for first year engineering degree students, and those following Foundation Degrees. New material includes: inequalities; differentiation of parametric equations; differentiation of hyperbolic functions; and homogeneous first order differential equations.\n\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 744 pages\nPublisher: Newnes; 5 edition (January 11, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0750681527\nISBN-13: 978-0750681520","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:388335cf24a921751d0340205e3ae1b5d873a92f","amp;dn":"Higher+Engineering+Mathematics+5th+Edition+by+John+Bird","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"388335cf24a921751d0340205e3ae1b5d873a92f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,131,53,207,36,169,33,117,29,3,64,32,94,58,225,181,216,115,169,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
