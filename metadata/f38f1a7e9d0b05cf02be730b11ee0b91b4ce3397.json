Like a tide of corrupted blood, it seethes across the land, devouring all. In its path stands an uneasy alliance: Onearm's army and Whiskeyjack's Bridgeburners alongside their enemies of old--the forces of the Warlord Caladan Brood, Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii mages, and the Rhivi people of the plains.\nBut ancient undead clans are also gathering; the T'lan Imass have risen. For it would seem something altogether darker and more malign threatens this world. Rumors abound that the Crippled God is now unchained and intent on a terrible revenge.\nMarking the return of many characters from Gardens of the Moon and introducing a host of remarkable new players, Memories of Ice is both a momentous new chapter in Steven Erikson's magnificent epic fantasy and a triumph of storytelling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f38f1a7e9d0b05cf02be730b11ee0b91b4ce3397","amp;dn":"Malazan+Book+of+the+Fallen+03+-+Memories+of+Ice-Steven+Erikson+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f38f1a7e9d0b05cf02be730b11ee0b91b4ce3397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,143,26,126,157,11,5,207,2,190,115,11,17,238,11,145,180,206,51,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
