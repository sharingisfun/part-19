It uniquely unites academic and industrial contributors for a balanced treatment of current innovations from academia and case studies from industry practice. For each reaction, a description of the current state-of-art is provided, including the scope and limitations, then illustrated with examples. This offers organic and process chemists an invaluable reference for applying key reactions in sustainable catalysis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:444cd5fabdbab42f09a5afcc4dd6b9814c7e9b77","amp;dn":"Sustainable+Catalysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"444cd5fabdbab42f09a5afcc4dd6b9814c7e9b77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,76,213,250,189,186,180,47,9,165,175,204,77,214,185,129,76,126,155,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
