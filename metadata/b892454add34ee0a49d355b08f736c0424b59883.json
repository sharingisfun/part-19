Surveying the literature which makes up so-called Holocaust Revisionism, the obsession with Auschwitz is undoubtedly one of its defining features. Since the early 1990s, with the advent of the modern world-wide web, Holocaust deniers have taken to the internet to try and argue their case. Until recently, the ensuing online debates between advocates of Holocaust denial and their critics have likewise focused on Auschwitz. In 2005, there was even a formal debate on Auschwitz between several prominent Revisionists and their critics, hosted at the Real Open Debate on the Holocaust forum.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Afterword: A Special Note by Jason Myers\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am not a Jew and I was at one time a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrevisionist.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ So said Jean-Claude Pressac in the postface to his monumental and technical study of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp.[1] This writer can sympathize with Pressac, as I too identify with such a statement.
