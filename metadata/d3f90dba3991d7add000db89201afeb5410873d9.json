Since 1959, conflict and aggression have dominated the story of U.S.-Cuban relations. Now, LeoGrande and Kornbluh present a new and increasingly more relevant account. From Kennedy's offering of an olive branch to Castro after the missile crisis, to Kissinger's top secret quest for normalization, to Obama's promise of a &quot;new approach,&quot; LeoGrande and Kornbluh reveal a fifty-year record of dialogue and negotiations, both open and furtive, indicating a path toward better relations in the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f90dba3991d7add000db89201afeb5410873d9","amp;dn":"Back+Channel+to+Cuba%3A+the+Hidden+History+of+Negotiations+Between","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f90dba3991d7add000db89201afeb5410873d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,249,13,186,57,145,215,173,208,0,219,137,32,26,254,181,65,8,115,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
