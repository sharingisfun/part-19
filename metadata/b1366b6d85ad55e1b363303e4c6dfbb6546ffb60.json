Billing (Wiley, 2000).pdf\r\n\r\nChemical reactions at surfaces do not follow the same reaction dynamics as atoms in the gas phase. The changes from &quot;ideal&quot; interactions depend on the electronic structure and the spatial and geometric shape of the surface. The dynamics of chemical reactions at surfaces have all the complexity of gas-phase molecules reaction dynamics, plus those associated with the additional phenomena due to the presence of a solid surface","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1366b6d85ad55e1b363303e4c6dfbb6546ffb60","amp;dn":"Dynamics+of+Molecule+Surface+Interactions+-+Gert+D.+Billing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1366b6d85ad55e1b363303e4c6dfbb6546ffb60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,54,107,109,133,173,85,225,179,99,48,62,76,109,251,182,84,111,251,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
