A collage of styles, the songs on this album are united by the themes of connecting the old with the new and cultivating the continued evolution of music rooted in ancient traditions. With sounds ranging from atmospheric flute and drum to soulful acoustic songs by singer-songwriters, the collection provides listeners a glimpse into the diverse world of contemporary Native American music from what is now the U.S. and Canada. --Putumayo.com\n\n\nIf you have any special requests for other Putumayo records, let me know and I'll see what I can do.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nIf you have any of the following Putumayo records, an upload would be greatly appreciated:\n\n- Music of the Andes\n- Australia\n- Australian Playground\n- American Playground\n- Cowboy Playground\n- Latin Dreamland\n- World Singalong","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a469e31fcf2d1b2e5e3ffcb6e769ad1013e9e4f4","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents+-+Native+America+%282014%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a469e31fcf2d1b2e5e3ffcb6e769ad1013e9e4f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,105,227,31,207,45,27,46,94,63,252,182,231,105,173,16,19,233,228,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
