Asimov&amp;#039;s style, however, is felt throughout the book.  Kristofer Batho does an excellent job narrating and will forever be the calm, nurturing voice of NDR-114 (Andrew) for me.  \n\nCan an incredibly advanced robot have emotions? an autopilot soul? an afterlife?  Can a robot experience creativity? love? maladaptive and even self-destructive neurotic obsessions?  Or is all this just electrons competing for circuits?  For the Asimov-Silverberg take on these questions and more, listen to this tender, heart-warming, heart-breaking, sci-fi tragedy.  And, of course, you can&amp;#039;t miss the ever-present three primary laws of robotics.\n\nThis book was based on Asimov&amp;#039;s earlier (duh!) novella, &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; which was also the basis for the 1999 movie of the same name starring Robin Williams as NDR.\n\nYes, Virginia, there is pleasing narration at 32 kb/sec.  d:c)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29d5ff8c26c6ec8fd0f688be0b3f206a0ee27c74","amp;dn":"The+Positronic+Man+-+Isaac+Asimov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29d5ff8c26c6ec8fd0f688be0b3f206a0ee27c74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,213,255,140,38,198,236,143,208,246,136,190,11,63,32,106,14,226,124,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
