Remaining new copies fetch several hundred dollars. As with most Kubrick films after &quot;2001,&quot; it's a compilation of various works, mainly by composers like his standby Ligeti and Penderecki, with some very eerie synthesized work by Wendy Carlos. I've added a few numbers heard in the film that were left off the original LP, among them &quot;Midnight and the Stars With You,&quot; heard over the closing credits.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:849272c0e8c599af6cacde8594fa889ae0305d56","amp;dn":"The+Shining+%28Original+Soundtrack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"849272c0e8c599af6cacde8594fa889ae0305d56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,146,114,192,232,197,153,175,108,172,222,133,148,250,136,154,224,48,93,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
