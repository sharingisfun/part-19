The tragedy occurred during the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Now, drawing on hours of exclusive interviews as well as recently declassified United States and Soviet intelligence files, Kenneth Sewell and Jerome Preisler explain what really happened to Scorpion.\n\nWhen a Soviet sub mysteriously sank near Hawaii, hundreds of miles from its normal station, Soviet naval leaders mistakenly believed that a U.S. submarine was to blame. Using a cryptographic unit acquired from the North Koreans to decipher classified Navy communications, they set a trap for revenge. All Hands Down explains how the plan was executed and why the truth of the attack has been officially denied for 40 years. \n\nLENGTH: 7 hrs and 43 mins\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2008 Kenneth Sewell and Jerome Priesler; (P)2008 Blackstone Audio, Inc.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:096cb05aeffaa781eaa0f7d4869c16e8584b2c7f","amp;dn":"The+True+Story+of+the+Soviet+Attack+on+the+USS+Scorpion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"096cb05aeffaa781eaa0f7d4869c16e8584b2c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,108,176,90,239,250,167,129,234,160,247,212,134,156,22,232,88,75,44,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
