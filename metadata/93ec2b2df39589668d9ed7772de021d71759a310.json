All 41:09 of it. All of the official releases of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLiving The BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ either chopped off the second half of the tune or released it as two parts. Now you can listen to this monster of a song as if you were sitting in the audience that day. This song also had the distinction of being the longest recorded rock song until the CD age gave us 70+ minutes to play with. It took just over two hours in Cool Edit Pro to fix the two tracks. The connection is around the 20 minute mark just before the guitar solo. I spent an hour listening over and over &amp; studying the wave files until I found a duplicated wave in the fade of both tracks. After connecting the two halves at the right point, I spent the next hour slowly boosting the wave file until it matched the rest of the song. It came out quite well I think.   \nAlso included is a 19 minute tour de force, &quot;Parthenogenesis&quot;, which displays the quintet at their most experimental. In addition is their incarnation of Henry Thomas &quot;Bulldozer Blues&quot; where Alan Wilson retained the tune of the original song, rewrote the lyric and came up with &quot;Going Up The Country&quot;, whose simple message caught the back to nature attitude of the late 60's and went to number one in 25 countries around the world. This was ripped from the 1994 Japanese CD release. Excellent sound. The only drawback is they didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t use the original US art.\n\nTrack List\n1. Pony Blues  3:52\n2.

Refried Boogie  41:09\n\nA hard-luck blues band of the '60s, Canned Heat was founded by blues historians and record collectors Alan Wilson and Bob Hite. They seemed to be on the right track and played all the right festivals (including Monterey and Woodstock, making it very prominently into the documentaries about both) but somehow never found a lasting audience.\n\nCertainly their hearts were in the right place. Canned Heat's debut album -- released shortly after their appearance at Monterey -- was every bit as deep into the roots of the blues as any other combo of the time mining similar turf, with the exception of the original Paul Butterfield band. Hite was nicknamed &quot;The Bear&quot; and stalked the stage in the time-honored tradition of Howlin' Wolf and other large-proportioned bluesmen. Wilson was an extraordinary harmonica player, with a fat tone and great vibrato. His work on guitar, especially in open tunings (he played on Son House's rediscovery recordings of the mid-'60s, incidentally) gave the band a depth and texture that most other rhythm players could only aspire to. Henry Vestine -- another dyed-in-the-wool record collector -- was the West Coast's answer to Michael Bloomfield and capable of fretboard fireworks at a moment's notice.\n\nCanned Heat's breakthrough moment occurred with the release of their second album, establishing them with hippie ballroom audiences as the &quot;kings of the boogie.&quot; As a way of paying homage to the musician they got the idea from in the first place, they later collaborated on an album with John Lee Hooker that was one of the elder bluesman's most successful outings with a young white (or black, for that matter) combo backing him up. After two big chart hits with &quot;Goin' Up the Country&quot; and an explosive version of Wilbert Harrison's &quot;Let's Work Together,&quot; Wilson died under mysterious (probably drug-related) circumstances in 1970, and Hite carried on with various reconstituted versions of the band until his death just before a show in 1981, from a heart seizure.\n\nStill, the surviving members -- led by drummer Adolfo &quot;Fito&quot; de la Parra -- continued touring and recording, recruiting new vocalist Walter Trout; he was replaced in 1985 by James Thornbury, who fronted the band for the next decade. After Thornbury exited in 1995, Canned Heat tapped Robert Lucas to assume lead vocal duties; they soon recorded The Canned Heat Blues Band, which sadly was Vestine's last recording with the group -- he died in Paris in December 1997 in the wake of the band's recent tour. Boogie 2000 followed two years later.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93ec2b2df39589668d9ed7772de021d71759a310","amp;dn":"Canned+Heat+-+Living+The+Blues+1968+2CDs+Refried+Boogie+patched","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93ec2b2df39589668d9ed7772de021d71759a310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,236,43,45,243,149,137,102,141,158,215,119,45,224,33,215,23,89,163,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
