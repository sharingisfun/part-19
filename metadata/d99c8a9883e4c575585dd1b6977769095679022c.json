It is therefore clear that in order to provide modern armies in the field with effective air cover, that modern anti-aircraft tanks must possess the highest possible standards in regards to mobility, fire power and armored protection.\nOn October 29th 1980, the last of the Gepard anti-aircraft tanks procured for the German Army was officially handed over by Krauss-Maffei AG at their factory in Munich.\nThis book describes the long journey till this became a reality.\n\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Gepard-history-German-anti-aircraft-tanks/dp/376375198X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Gepard-history-German-anti-aircraft-tanks/dp/376375198X&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d99c8a9883e4c575585dd1b6977769095679022c","amp;dn":"Gepard%3A+The+history+of+German+anti-aircraft+tanks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d99c8a9883e4c575585dd1b6977769095679022c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,156,138,152,131,228,197,117,88,93,209,182,151,119,105,9,86,121,2,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
