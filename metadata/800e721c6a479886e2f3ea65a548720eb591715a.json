He was       \n    67. With his powerful signature vocals and doom-laden lyrics, Ronnie     \n    James Dio fronted several iconic bands during his career: Elf,           \n    Rainbow, Black Sabbath and, of course, Dio. Possessed with one of the    \n    most recognizable voices in rock music, Dio's onstage theatrics,         \n    medieval themes and cool stage presence helped win the adulation of      \n    generations of metal fans and musicians.
