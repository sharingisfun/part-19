Currently, Machete can edit video and audio files in AVI, FLV, WMV, MP4, MOV, WMA, MP3 and WAV formats. The support of editing functions for other formats is planned for future versions of the program.\n\n\n\nWith its extremely user-friendly design, Machete is an ideal solution for quick and easy &quot;slicing&quot; of your multimedia files. You can delete unnecessary fragments (e.g. cut out commercials), copy, move, mix and save individual pieces. This means that Machete combines the functionality of both video splitter (cutter, trimmer), video joiner (for joining multimedia files with exactly the same formats) and more.\n\nNone of the editing operations in Machete requires re-encoding of video or audio streams. This is why the editing process is very quick and does not lead to any loss of video quality. This puts Machete in the category of lossless video editors. Also, it means that you do not need a powerful and expensive computer to edit your video material. After a file is edited and saved, it retains its original format.\n\nMachete fully supports Windows Clipboard functionality. It means that you do not need to save the file after each editing operation. You can do all the editing that you need in the main window, view the result and save the resulting file just once.\n\nThe program does not require installation of any special codecs in addition to regular decoders that are needed for video viewing and audio playback.\n\n \n\nWith Machete, you can do the following:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Play AVI, WMV, MP4, MOV, WMA, MP3, WAV and FLV video and audio files, as well as some others \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Edit FLV (Flash Video) video and audio files (*.flv)\n\nmost video codecs supported: H.263 (FLV1), On2 VP6 (FLV4) and H.264 (AVC)\nmost audio codecs supported: AAC, MP3 and others \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Edit MP4 (MPEG-4) and MOV (Apple QuickTime) video and audio files (*.mp4, *.mov)\n\nmost video codecs supported: H.264 (AVC), MP4V\nonly AAC and MP3 audio codecs supported \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Edit WMV video files (*.wmv, *.asf) and WMA audio files(*.wma)\n\nmost video codecs supported: WMV, MSS and others\nmost audio codecs supported: WMA, MP3 and others\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Edit AVI video files (*.avi)\n\nmost video codecs supported: DV (Digital Video Type 1, 2), DivX, XviD and others\nmost audio codecs supported: MP3 (VBR and CBR), AC3 and others\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Edit MP3 (MPEG Layer-3) audio files (*.mp3)\n\nVBR and CBR encoding supported\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Edit uncompressed WAV (Waveform audio format) audio files (*.wav)\n\nPCM bitstream supported\n* For all formats listed above, the following editing operations are available:\n\ncut, copy, delete and paste fragments of video files\nsave video fragments as separate files\ninsert one video file into another file of the same format\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Edit file tags (metadata) for all supported media formats\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Extract and save audio stream as a separate file\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Extract and save video stream as a separate file\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Add/Replace audio stream in video files \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Save a video frame as a bitmap (*.bmp) file\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d61ffc3686e4ab5554a50054ff538a54ae757dd","amp;dn":"Machetesoft+Video+Editor+and+Joiner+v.3.8+%2B+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d61ffc3686e4ab5554a50054ff538a54ae757dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,97,255,195,104,110,74,181,85,74,80,5,79,245,56,165,74,231,87,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
