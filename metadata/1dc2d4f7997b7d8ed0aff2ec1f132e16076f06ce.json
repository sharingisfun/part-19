The arrangements (here provided by Henri Rene, Johnnie Spence, and Frank DeVol, alternately) are often soaring and string-heavy, and horns are prominent, especially on Fitzgerald&amp;#039;s enthusiastic, solidly swinging renditions of the showtune title track, the Beatles&amp;#039; &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Buy Me Love,&quot; and Richard Rodgers&amp;#039;s &quot;The Sweetest Sounds.&quot;\n\nThe rest of the record is filled with lush, gentle tracks, including the thoughtful &quot;People,&quot; the lilting &quot;How High the Moon,&quot; and the lightly swaying &quot;Volare,&quot; which features the great Hank Jones on piano. As always, Fitzgerald&amp;#039;s gorgeous, crystal-clear singing glides effortlessly over the instrumentation, immediately entrancing listeners with her intuitive phrasing and undeniable charisma. For fans of pop vocals, this album is an ideal portal into the extensive catalog of this legendary performer.\n\nTrack 1- 4; Ella Fitzgerald (vocal) with orchestra: Johnnie Spence (conductor)\nTrack 5-12;\nElla Fitzgerald (vocal) with orchestra:\nZoot Sims (tenoe saxophone;\nFrank DeVol (conductor; other unknown)\nHank Jones (piano) on track 8\n\nRecording information: New York, New York (1964); London, England (1964)\n\nTrack listing:\n1.
