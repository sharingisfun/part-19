Seriously. \n\nUnlike other F&amp;B trade magazines, The Pro Chef Middle East focuses on chefs and their inspiration, allowing them to demonstrate their talents as well as providing a platform for skill transfer, produce knowledge and recipe development. And, unlike other food magazines aimed at the amateur cook, it will provide enthusiastic fine diners with a real insight into the world of the professional chef, inspiring them to visit restaurants and develop their own cooking techniques and menus. For both communities, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a resource of new products and equipment. And for suppliers and manufacturers wanting to reach both a professional front and back of house audience and a keen amateur community, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an irresistible mix. The Pro Chef Middle East is a food magazine like no other in the regional market, aimed exclusively at a knowledgeable and high spending audience, interested in everything from quality knives or kitchen equipment to premium produce and speciality ingredients.
