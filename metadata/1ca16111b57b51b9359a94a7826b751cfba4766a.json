The band, founded in 1968, overcame a generational shift in its audience and the departure of its most visible members at key points in its history to reach the end of the century as the definitive progressive rock band. Where rivals such as Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer withered away commercially after the mid-'70s, and Genesis and King Crimson altered their sounds so radically as to become unrecognizable to their original fans, Yes retained the same sound, and performed much of the same repertoire that they were doing in 1971, and for their trouble, they found themselves being taken seriously a quarter of a century later. Their audience remained huge because they had always attracted younger listeners drawn to their mix of daunting virtuosity, cosmic (often mystical) lyrics, complex musical textures, and powerful yet delicate lead vocals.\n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n01.Believe Again\n02.The Game\n03.Step Beyond\n04.To Ascend\n05.In A World Of Our Own\n06.Light Of The Ages\n07.It Was All We Knew\n08.Subway Walls\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ca16111b57b51b9359a94a7826b751cfba4766a","amp;dn":"Yes+-+Heaven+%26amp%3B+Earth+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ca16111b57b51b9359a94a7826b751cfba4766a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,161,97,17,181,123,81,185,53,154,148,167,130,107,117,28,251,164,118,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
