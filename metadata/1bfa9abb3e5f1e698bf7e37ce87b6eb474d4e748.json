The film is based on a story by Bernard Girard and stars Rory Calhoun, Beverly Garland, John Larch, Russell Johnson and Fortunio Bonanova. It has also been released under the title: Hemp Brown. \n\nSaga of Hemp Brown gets under way when the title character (Rory Calhoun) is court-martialed and booted from the Cavalry. \n\nBrown is accused of permitting his men to walk into a deadly ambush; he knows he's innocent, and he spends the rest of the picture tracking down the real culprit.\n\nJoining a travelling medicine show, Brown falls in love with pretty snake-oil peddler Mona Langley (Beverly Garland). \nShe is instrumental in helping Brown corner the mastermind behind the ambush (whose identity must remain secret in this paragraph). As a western, Saga of Hemp Brown is more of the same; the film's greatest strength is the unstressed rapport between stars Rory Calhoun and Beverly Garland.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 743mb\nDuration.... 01:16:27\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 718\nFrame Height.... 540\nData Rate.... 1191kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 163kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sampl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bfa9abb3e5f1e698bf7e37ce87b6eb474d4e748","amp;dn":"The+Saga+of+Hemp+Brown+1958+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bfa9abb3e5f1e698bf7e37ce87b6eb474d4e748","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,250,154,187,62,95,30,105,139,247,227,124,232,123,110,180,116,212,231,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
