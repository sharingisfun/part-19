It is a early utopian work.\n\nThe work was written in Italian in 1602, shortly after Campanellas imprisonment for heresy and sedition. A Latin version was written in 1613ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1614 and published in Frankfurt in 1623.\n\nThe City of the Sun is presented as a dialogue between a Grandmaster of the Knights Hospitaller and a Genoese Sea-Captain. Inspired by Platos Republic and the description of Atlantis in Timaeus, it describes a theocratic society where goods, women and children are held in common. It also resembles the City of Adocentyn in the Picatrix, an Arabic grimoire of astrological magic. In the final part of the work, Campanella prophesies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in the veiled language of astrologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that the Spanish kings, in alliance with the Pope, are destined to be the instruments of a Divine Plan: the final victory of the True Faith and its diffusion in the whole world. While one could argue that Campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the New World, it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before The City of the Sun, The Monarchy in Spain, in which Campanella exposes his vision of a unified, peaceful world governed by a theocratic monarchy.\n\nFile is in PDF format.\n\nSeed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8b9f7d10bbd0364ba064f1ca7deae474322ca9d","amp;dn":"The+City+of+the+Sun+by+Tommaso+Campanella","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8b9f7d10bbd0364ba064f1ca7deae474322ca9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,185,247,209,11,189,3,100,186,6,79,28,167,222,174,71,67,34,202,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
