In The New Indian Slow Cooker, veteran cooking teacher and chef Neela Paniz revolutionizes the long, slow approach to making Indian cuisine by rethinking its traditional recipes for the slow cooker.\n\nShe showcases the best regional curries, dals made with lentils and beans, vegetable and rice sides, as well as key accompaniments like chutneys, flatbreads, raita, and fresh Indian cheese. Using this fix-it-and-forget-it approach, you can produce complete and authentic Indian meals that taste like they came from Mumbai, New Delhi, and Bangalore, or your favorite Indian restaurant.\n\nFeaturing both classic and innovative recipes such as Pork Vindaloo, Kashmiri Potato Curry, Date and Tamarind Chutney, and Curried Chickpeas, these full-flavor, no-fuss dishes are perfect for busy cooks any day of the week.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5a6468119cfed86bd5517441862761d67e750ec","amp;dn":"The+New+Indian+Slow+Cooker+-+Neela+Paniz+%28ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5a6468119cfed86bd5517441862761d67e750ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,166,70,129,25,207,237,134,189,85,23,68,24,98,118,29,103,231,80,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
