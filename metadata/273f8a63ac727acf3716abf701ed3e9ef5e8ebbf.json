Dragan Dautovski Quartet was created in July 2000 in Skopje, Macedonia. This band's basic inspiration is Macedonian music folklore idiom. From depth of the folklore, through the various contemporary music aesthetic elements and styles the goal is to create a synthesis of the traditional and modern. The authentic ambient is captured by traditional music instruments (kaval, pipe, tambura,)\n\nTheir music is a mixture of traditional and self-penned tunes and a mixture of folk, jazz, and a touch of rock. Outside his native Macedonia, multi-instrumentalist Dragan Dautovski is best known for his score to Milco Mancevski's film &quot;Before the Rain.&quot; With a fulsome range of traditional Macedonian instruments, the newly arranged traditional songs combine the complexity typical of Macedonian rhythm and the emotional power typical of Macedonia's rich musical heritage.\n\n2000 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Roots and Blossoms cdep\n01 Oj jano, jano\n02 Zajdi, zajdi\n\n2001 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Path of the Sun\n01 Molitva(prayer)\n02 Ogledalo (Mirror)\n03 Gorocvet(Highland blossom)\n04 Kopnez(Longning)\n05 Meschina (moon)\n06 Patuvajne (Journey)\n07 Jano, jano\n08 Balkan\n09 Nauprot Vetrot (Against the vind)\n\n2008 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Razboj\n01 Veligdensko (instrumental) \n02 Doce, doce (instrumental)\n03 Mace macke (traditional song)\n04 Dracevsko zensko oro (instrumental)\n05 Dafino mome (traditional song) \n06 Nevstinsko (instrumental)\n07 Kucka liljana (traditional song) \n08 Kumanovka (instrumental) \n09 Splet (instrumental) \n10 More rasti, rasti (traditional song) \n11 Gajdarsko (instrumental) \n12 Sitna lisa (instrumental)\n13 Zableala kalesh ovca (traditional song)\n14 Jasna mesecina (traditional song)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:273f8a63ac727acf3716abf701ed3e9ef5e8ebbf","amp;dn":"Dragan+Dautovski+Quartet+%28Macedonia%29+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"273f8a63ac727acf3716abf701ed3e9ef5e8ebbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,63,138,99,172,114,122,207,55,22,171,247,1,237,62,158,245,232,235,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
