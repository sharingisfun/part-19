It examines mythology, its effect on ethics, and how that relates to sustainability. The novel uses a style of Socratic dialogue to deconstruct the notion that humans are the end product, the pinnacle of biological evolution. It posits that human supremacy is a cultural myth, and asserts that modern civilization is &quot;enacting&quot; that myth.\n\nPlease, comment about it if you like it or not. :) Enjoy. \nThis book is really good","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a3d961753e0b2e0ca61a7422e8a92be833e3f6f","amp;dn":"ISHMAEL.++An+Adventure+of+the+Mind+and+Spirit.doc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a3d961753e0b2e0ca61a7422e8a92be833e3f6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,61,150,23,83,224,178,224,202,97,167,66,46,138,146,190,131,62,63,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
