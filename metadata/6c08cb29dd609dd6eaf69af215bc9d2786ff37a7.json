A corrupt leader\n  has the islands in his  grasp  ...  yet  a  group  of  rebels  fights  for\n  democratic values and freedom. However, once the head  of  the  rebels  is\n  arrested, the insurgents quickly dissolve. Arriving  on  the  island,  the\n  player's mission is to help the rebellion before things take  a  turn  for\n  the worse. \n\n  Take control of your own band of mercenaries, lead them  into  battle  and\n  manage your resources wisely. Fight back for freedom,  sector  by  sector,\n  turn by turn. Like the original Jagged Alliance  series,  Jagged  Alliance\n  Flashback gives you the choice to use your  preferred  tactics  and  build\n  your squad around it - rush in with heavy armed troops or  take  the  high\n  road of distance shots and sniping. \n\n  Installation Information:\n  ========================= \n\n  * Burn or mount\n  * Install\n  * Play the game \n\n  NOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall. \n\n                                                              /TEAM FAiRLIGHT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c08cb29dd609dd6eaf69af215bc9d2786ff37a7","amp;dn":"Jagged.Alliance.Flashback-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c08cb29dd609dd6eaf69af215bc9d2786ff37a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,8,203,41,221,96,157,214,234,246,154,242,21,188,157,39,134,255,55,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
