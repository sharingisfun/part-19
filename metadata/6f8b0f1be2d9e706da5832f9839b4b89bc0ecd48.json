The game is a combination of a fighting game and a wrestling game, with combos playing a major factor in gameplay, both on the ground and mid-air. Characters will perform exaggerated moves, such as John Cena\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Attitude Adjustment, in which he dives high into the air, Triple H\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Pedigree with shock waves running across the ring and Bret Hart\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Sharpshooter with a slow motion smile and finger pointed towards the crowd for a few seconds, prior to the same.The game features present WWE wrestlers such as Kofi Kingston, Randy Orton, and John Cena and past WWE wrestlers such as The Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, and the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Macho Man\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Randy Savage, as well as commentary from Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler.\nThe first official announcement for both WWE All Stars and WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 was made at E3 in June 2010 by THQ, shortly followed by an interview with gaming website GameSpot.\nWWE All Stars is the first WWE game to be produced by THQ San Diego. Many of the team\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s employees had worked Midway San Diego, the studio that developed the first TNA Impact! professional wrestling video game. [8] It is the second WWE game produced by video game designer, Sal Divita, the first being WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n***********************************************************************************\n\nSEED AND COMMENT PLEASE!!!\n\nNOTE: My last torrent didnt workout so well sorry about that...\n\nMy Game Review 5/10\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f8b0f1be2d9e706da5832f9839b4b89bc0ecd48","amp;dn":"+ALL-STARS+2011+ps2+game+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f8b0f1be2d9e706da5832f9839b4b89bc0ecd48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,139,15,27,226,217,231,6,218,88,50,249,131,155,75,137,188,14,205,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
