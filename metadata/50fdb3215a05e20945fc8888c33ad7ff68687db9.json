Others may simply escape into a delightful adventure about freedom and flight. Either way it's an uncommon treat.\n\n&quot;You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way&quot;. \n\n&quot;You will begin to touch heaven, Jonathan, in the moment that you touch perfect speed. And that isn't flying a thousand miles an hour, or a million, or flying at the speed of light. Because any number is a limit, and perfection doesn't have limits. Perfect speed, my son, is being there.&quot;\n\n&quot;He was not bone and feather but a perfect idea of freedom and flight, limited by nothing at all&quot;\n\nFormat: WAV\nBitrate: 411 kbps\nNarrated by Richard Harris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50fdb3215a05e20945fc8888c33ad7ff68687db9","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Livingston+Seagull%2C+as+told+by+Richard+Harris+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50fdb3215a05e20945fc8888c33ad7ff68687db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,253,179,33,90,5,226,9,69,252,136,136,195,58,215,255,104,104,125,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
