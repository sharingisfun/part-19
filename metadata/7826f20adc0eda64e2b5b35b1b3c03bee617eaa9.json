These two volumes are a rare side-by-side compilation of high-level government self-evaluation of its own performance in an historic and controversial event. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7826f20adc0eda64e2b5b35b1b3c03bee617eaa9","amp;dn":"CIA+Bay+of+Pigs+Official+Histories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7826f20adc0eda64e2b5b35b1b3c03bee617eaa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,38,242,10,220,14,218,100,226,181,179,91,27,60,3,190,230,23,234,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
